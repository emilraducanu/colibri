    "### Text Cleaning\n",
    "    Remove any unnecessary characters, such as special characters, punctuation, or HTML tags.\n",
    "    Convert the text to lowercase to achieve case-insensitive matching.\n",
    "    Remove any extra whitespace or leading/trailing spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenization\n",
    "    Split the text into individual words or tokens, as it helps the model understand the semantic meaning of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stopword Removal\n",
    "    Remove common words, known as stopwords (e.g., \"the,\" \"is,\" \"and\"), which may not contribute much to the classification task.\n",
    "    You can use pre-defined stopword lists from libraries like NLTK or spaCy or create a custom list based on your specific domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lemmatization or Stemming\n",
    "    Reduce words to their base or root form to normalize the text and reduce vocabulary size.\n",
    "    Lemmatization aims to convert words to their base form (lemma) using linguistic rules.\n",
    "    Stemming reduces words to their root form using simple heuristic algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Abbreviations and Acronyms\n",
    "    Decide whether to expand or keep abbreviations and acronyms as they are, based on their relevance to the classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Numeric Data\n",
    "    Decide whether to replace numbers with a generic token or keep them as-is based on their importance in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Rare Words or Outliers\n",
    "    Remove extremely rare words that occur infrequently, as they may not contribute significantly to the classification task.\n",
    "    Similarly, remove any outliers or unusual words that may not be relevant to the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectorization\n",
    "    Convert the pre-processed text data into numerical representations that machine learning models can understand.\n",
    "    Techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe can be employed for vectorization."
