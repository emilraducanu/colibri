0,excluded,Responses of a rice-wheat rotation agroecosystem to experimental warming,"Climate change is likely to affect agroecosystems in many ways. This study was performed to investigate how a rice-winter wheat rotation agroecosystem in southeast China would respond to global warming. By using an infrared heater system, the soil surface temperature was maintained about 1.5 A degrees C above ambient milieu over 3 years. In the third growing season (2009-2010), the evapotranspiration (ET) rate, crop production, soil respiration, and soil carbon pool were monitored. The ET rate was 23 % higher in the warmed plot as compared to the control plot during the rice paddy growing season, and the rice grain yield was 16.3 % lower, but there was no significant difference in these parameters between the plots during the winter wheat-growing season. The phenology of the winter wheat shifted under experimental warming, and ET may decrease late in the winter wheat-growing season. Experimental warming significantly enhanced soil respiration, with mean annual soil respiration rates of 2.57 +/- A 0.17 and 1.96 +/- A 0.06 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) observed in the warmed and control plots, respectively. After 3 years of warming, a significant decrease in the total organic carbon was observed, but only in the surface soil (0-5 cm). Warming also stimulated the belowground biomass, which may have compensated for any heat-induced loss of soil organic carbon. Paddy rice seemed to be more vulnerable to warming than winter wheat in terms of water-use efficiency and grain production.",
1,excluded,The number of cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with prognosis of stage iiic-iv high-grade serous ovarian cancer,"Objective No consensus exists on the number of chemotherapy cycles to be administered before and after interval debulking surgery (IDS) in patients with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer. The present study aims to explore the optimal number of cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and post-operation chemotherapy to treat the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIc-IV high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HG-SOC). Materials and Methods A total of 129 IIIc-IV stage HGSOC cases were retrospectively analyzed. Cases were comprised of patients who underwent NAC followed by IDS and who achieved clinical complete response (CCR) at the end of primary therapy. Patients were recruited from the Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research between 1993 and 2013. Optimal IDS-associated factors were explored with logistic regression. The association between progressionfree survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) duration, and covariates was assessed by Cox proportional hazards model and log-rank test. Results The median number of NAC cycle was 3 (range 1-8). CA-125 decreasing kinetics (p = 0.01) was independently associated with optimal IDS. CA-125 decreasing kinetics, optimal IDS, and NAC cycles was independently associated with OS (p < 0.01, p < 0.01, p = 0.03, respectively) and PFS (p < 0.01, p < 0.01, p = 0.04, respectively). The PFS of patients who underwent >= 5 NAC cycles was shorter than those of patients who underwent <5 NAC cycles (12.3 versus 17.2 months). The PFS and OS of patients who underwent < 5 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy post-IDS were shorter than those of patients who underwent C5 cycles (14.2 and 20.3 versus 21.2 and 28.8 months). Conclusion NAC cycles, CA-125 decreasing kinetics, and optimal debulking are independently associated with the prognosis of patients with advanced stage HG-SOC who underwent NAC/IDS and achieved CCR. The number of administered NAC cycles should not exceed 4.",High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HG-SOC); CA-125; Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC); Interval debulking surgery (IDS); Clinical complete response (CCR)
2,excluded,Carbon cycling in temperate grassland under elevated temperature,"An increase in mean soil surface temperature has been observed over the last century, and it is predicted to further increase in the future. The effect of increased temperature on ecosystem carbon fluxes in a permanent temperate grassland was studied in a long-term (6years) field experiment, using multiple temperature increments induced by IR lamps. Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were measured and modeled by a modified Lloyd and Taylor model including a soil moisture component for R-eco (average R-2 of 0.78) and inclusion of a photosynthetic component based on temperature and radiation for NEE (R-2=0.65). Modeled NEE values ranged between 2.3 and 5.3kg CO(2)m(-2)year(-1), depending on treatment. An increase of 2 or 3 degrees C led to increased carbon losses, lowering the carbon storage potential by around 4tonnes of C ha(-1)year(-1). The majority of significant NEE differences were found during night-time compared to daytime. This suggests that during daytime the increased respiration could be offset by an increase in photosynthetic uptake. This was also supported by differences in C-13 and O-18, indicating prolonged increased photosynthetic activity associated with the higher temperature treatments. However, this increase in photosynthesis was insufficient to counteract the 24h increase in respiration, explaining the higher CO2 emissions due to elevated temperature.",CO; (2); elevated temperature; grassland; heating; isotopes; net ecosystem exchange; respiration
3,included,How can straw incorporation management impact on soil carbon storage? A meta-analysis,"Straw incorporation (SI) is a common practice in China and has important implications for agricultural sustainability. This study aimed to quantitatively summarise the response of top soil (0-20 cm) carbon (C) to SI under different agricultural management regimes. Results indicated that compared with straw removal (SR), SI significantly increased soil C storage by 12 %. Moreover, incorporation of chopped straw with tillage treatment (ploughing and rotary tillage) increased C storage compared to unchopped straw without tillage treatment. SI implementation with upland cropping, in the northwest and northeast resulted in higher C storage compared with rice cropping, and in the northern and southern regions. Changes in soil C were observed based on SI variables, including tillage and straw amounts in fine-textured soils, however straw amount rather than tillage treatment exhibited a greater influence on soil C in coarse-textured soils. We concluded SI implementation with increased amounts of chopped straw for a longer duration was favourable to soil C sequestration in Chinese croplands. Furthermore, we estimated if SI was popularised across all of China's agricultural regions, soil C sequestration potential would reach 48.2 similar to 56.2 Tg C year(-1). SI practices should therefore be encouraged.",China; Meta analysis; Soil carbon (C) sequestration; Soil carbon storage; Straw incorporation
4,excluded,Comparison of prescribing criteria to evaluate the appropriateness of drug treatment in individuals aged 65 and older: a systematic review,"Because inappropriate prescribing is prevalent in individuals aged 65 and older, various criteria to assess it have been developed. This study's aim was to systematically review articles that describe criteria for assessing inappropriate prescribing in individuals aged 65 and older and to define the circumstances of their use (explicit/implicit), origins, development processes, and content. A systematic search was conducted on MEDLINE and PubMed (1990-2010) and augmented with a manual search. Original articles written in English were included if they described the development of the criteria and were aimed at people aged 65 and older. Articles that described criteria applicable only in hospital settings, specific drugs, or a particular disease or condition were excluded. Sixteen of 535 articles met the inclusion criteria. They described 14 criteria, half originating in the United States. The English-language restriction limited the search results. Most criteria were explicit, consensus validated, based totally or partly on Beers criteria, and focused on pharmacological appropriateness of prescribing and some were old. Drug-and disease-oriented explicit criteria require regular updating and are country specific. Implicit, person-specific criteria are universal and do not need updating, although their use requires up-to-date professional skills. Unlike explicit criteria, implicit criteria have been validated in people. Some of the 14 criteria were noncomprehensive, mainly because of the intended purpose. To conclude, different criteria exist for optimizing prescribing for individuals aged 65 and older. Possible deficiencies must be recognized and trade-offs made when selecting criteria for use. In the future, more-comprehensive and - timely criteria are needed. J Am Geriatr Soc 59:1521-1530, 2011.",
5,included,Responses of microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen to experimental warming: A meta-analysis,"Soil microbes play important roles in regulating terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycling and strongly influence feedbacks of ecosystems to global warming. However, the inconsistent responses of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) to experimental warming have been observed, and the response ratio between MBC and MBN (MBC:MBN) has not been identified. This meta-analysis synthesized warming experiments at 58 sites globally to investigate the responses of MBC:MBN to climate warming. Our results showed that warming significantly increased MBC by 3.61 +/- 0.80% and MBN by 5.85 +/- 0.90% and thus decreased the MBC:MBN by 3.34 +/- 0.66%. MBC showed positive responses to warming but MBN exhibited negative responses to warming at low warming magnitude (<1 degrees C); however, at high warming magnitude (>2 degrees C) the results were inverted. The different effects of warming magnitude on microbial biomass resulted from the warming -induced decline in soil moisture and substrate supply. Moreover, MBC and MBN had strong positive responses to warming at the mid-term (3-4 years) or short-term (1-2 years) duration, but the responses tended to decrease at long-term (>= 5 years) warming duration. This study fills the knowledge gap on the responses of MBC:MBN to warming and may benefit the development of coupled carbon and nitrogen models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

6,excluded,Are active organic matter fractions suitable indices of management effects on soil carbon? A meta-analysis of data from the Pampas,"Active fractions of organic matter have been proposed as early indices of changes in soil organic carbon (organic-C) induced by management. We performed a meta-analysis of published results from 31 field experiments conducted in the Pampas in which tillage and rotation effects on organic-C, microbial biomass carbon (microbial-C), light fraction carbon (light-C), particulate carbon (particulate-C) and basal respiration (mineralized-C) were assessed. We compared the changes of organic-C and the four active fractions between management treatments sampled at the same date and depth within each experiment. Pooling all the experiments, active fractions-C varied on average 1.2- to 3.0-fold more than organic-C, depending on the fraction considered, but these average changes were significantly greater than organic-C changes only for particulate-C. This later fraction showed to be more sensitive to agricultural practices than organic-C. In experiments in which organic-C changes were lower than 15-25%, the four labile fractions may show opposite trends than organic-C. Above this threshold, changes of active fractions generally copied organic-C changes and were greater. Consequently, the active fractions may be used as indicators of changes in organic-C only when this latter variable has already suffered a huge change. In these cases, it will be easier to simply measure organic-C.",Active fractions of organic matter; microbial biomass; light organic fraction; particulate carbon; basal respiration
7,included,Long-term nitrogen fertilization decreases bacterial diversity and favors the growth of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria in agro-ecosystems across the globe,"Long-term elevated nitrogen (N) input from anthropogenic sources may cause soil acidification and decrease crop yield, yet the response of the belowground microbial community to long-term N input alone or in combination with phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) is poorly understood. We explored the effect of long-term N and NPK fertilization on soil bacterial diversity and community composition using meta-analysis of a global dataset. Nitrogen fertilization decreased soil pH, and increased soil organic carbon (C) and available N contents. Bacterial taxonomic diversity was decreased by N fertilization alone, but was increased by NPK fertilization. The effect of N fertilization on bacterial diversity varied with soil texture and water management, but was independent of crop type or N application rate. Changes in bacterial diversity were positively related to both soil pH and organic C content under N fertilization alone, but only to soil organic C under NPK fertilization. Microbial biomass C decreased with decreasing bacterial diversity under long-term N fertilization. Nitrogen fertilization increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, but reduced the abundance of Acidobacteria, consistent with the general life history strategy theory for bacteria. The positive correlation between N application rate and the relative abundance of Actinobacteria indicates that increased N availability favored the growth of Actinobacteria. This first global analysis of long-term N and NPK fertilization that differentially affects bacterial diversity and community composition provides a reference for nutrient management strategies for maintaining belowground microbial diversity in agro-ecosystems worldwide.",Actinobacteria; agro-ecosystems; bacterial diversity; community composition; microbial biomass; N fertilization
8,excluded,Comt and mthfr polymorphisms interaction on cognition in schizophrenia: an exploratory study,"The investigation of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT-[rs4680]) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR-[rs1801133]) polymorphisms' interaction might shed light into the pathogenetic mechanisms of the cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. In an exploratory study, we hypothesized that the MTHFR 677T allele which has been related to a hypoactive MTHFR enzyme would augment the unfavorable effects of COMT Val158 homozygosity which has been associated with COMT enzyme hyperfunction. 90 schizophrenia patients and 55 healthy volunteers were assessed on psychomotor speed, pattern and spatial recognition memory (SRM), spatial working memory (SWM), attentional flexibility and planning (Stockings of Cambridge-SOC). IQ scores in a random subgroup of patients were also measured. A significant COMT x MTHFR interaction on SWM (p = 0.048) and planning (p = 0.026) was revealed in both groups. Among COMT-Val/Val participants, MTHFR-C/C made more SWM errors (p = 0.033) and solved fewer SOC problems (p = 0.025) than MTHFR-T carriers. In patients, there was a significant COMT x MTHFR interaction on full scale IQ (p = 0.035): among COMT-Met carriers, MTHFR-T carriers performed significantly worse than MTHFR-C/C (p = 0.021), which was driven by a COMT x MTHFR interaction involving performance IQ(p = 0.047). In conclusion, COMT and MTHFR polymorphisms interacted on cognition, suggesting that the MTHFR enzyme activity might moderate the effects of the COMT enzyme. In contrast to our initial hypothesis, the MTHFRT-allele attenuated the cognitive effects of COMT Val homozygosity. In this preliminary study, we propose that dopaminergic and intracellular methylation mechanisms could interact on cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

9,excluded,Global-scale pattern of peatland sphagnum growth driven by photosynthetically active radiation and growing season length,"High-latitude peatlands contain about one third of the world's soil organic carbon, most of which is derived from partly decomposed Sphagnum (peat moss) plants. We conducted a meta-analysis based on a global data set of Sphagnum growth measurements collected from published literature to investigate the effects of bioclimatic variables on Sphagnum growth. Analysis of variance and general linear models were used to relate Sphagnum magellanicum and S. fuscum growth rates to photosynthetically active radiation integrated over the growing season (PAR0) and a moisture index. We found that PAR0 was the main predictor of Sphagnum growth for the global data set, and effective moisture was only correlated with moss growth at continental sites. The strong correlation between Sphagnum growth and PAR0 suggests the existence of a global pattern of growth, with slow rates under cool climate and short growing seasons, highlighting the important role of growing season length in explaining peatland biomass production. Large-scale patterns of cloudiness during the growing season might also limit moss growth. Although considerable uncertainty remains over the carbon balance of peatlands under a changing climate, our results suggest that increasing PAR0 as a result of global warming and lengthening growing seasons, without major change in cloudiness, could promote Sphagnum growth. Assuming that production and decomposition have the same sensitivity to temperature, this enhanced growth could lead to greater peat-carbon sequestration, inducing a negative feedback to climate change.",
10,excluded,"Effects of long-term litter manipulation on soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in a temperate deciduous forest","Changes in above-ground litterfall can influence below-ground biogeochemical processes in forests. In order to examine how above-ground litter inputs affect soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in a temperate deciduous forest, we studied a 14-year-old small-scale litter manipulation experiment that included control, litter exclusion, and doubled litter addition at a mature Fagus sylvatica L. site. Total organic C (TOC), total N (TN) and total P (TP), total organic P (TOP), bioavailable inorganic P (Pi), microbial C, N and P, soil respiration and fine root biomass were analyzed in the A and in two B horizons. Our results showed that litter manipulation had no significant effect on TOC in the mineral soil. Litter addition increased the bioavailable Pi in the A horizon but had no significant effect on N in the mineral soil. Litter exclusion decreased TN and TP in the B horizon to a depth of 10 cm. In the A horizon of the litter exclusion treatment, TP, TOP and bioavailable Pi were increased, which is most likely due to the higher root biomass in this treatment. The high fine root biomass seems to have counteracted the effects of the excluded aboveground litter. In conclusion, our study indicates that aboveground litter is not an important source for C in the mineral soil and that P recycling from root litter might be more important than from above-ground litter.

11,excluded,Depression increases the risk of death independently from vascular events in elderly individuals: the three-city study,"BACKGROUNDHow much the association between depressive symptoms (DSs) and all-cause mortality depends on cardiovascular disease (CVD) events is poorly known. We aimed to prospectively quantify the association between DSs at repeated study visits and all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and the influence of incident CVD on this association. METHODSThe Three-City Study has included adults 65 years and older, who were examined at baseline between 1999 and 2001 and after 2, 4, 7, and 10 years of follow-up. At each visit, a score of 16 or greater on the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale defined the presence of DSs. DS status and incident coronary heart disease or stroke events were used as time-dependent variables in a Cox proportional hazard model of mortality. RESULTSWe studied 7377 participants (63.7% females) aged 73.8 years (SD = 5.4 years) without a history of CVD at baseline examination. DSs were present in 19% to 22% of subjects at each study visit. During a median follow-up of 9.4 years, 650 subjects developed a first CVD, and 1255 had died. After adjustment for baseline sociodemographic variables, vascular risk factors, impairment in daily life activities, and antidepressants, time-dependent DSs were associated with a 28% increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-1.55), and incident CVD event was associated with a 63% increased risk (HR = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.30-2.04). However, the association between DSs and mortality was not influenced by the occurrence of CVD (HR for DS and CVD interaction = 1.03; 95% CI = 0.66-1.61). A mediation analysis confirmed that incident CVD only explained 6.9% of the excess of mortality associated with DSs. CONCLUSIONIn older participants, the increased risk of all-cause mortality associated with the presence of DSs at baseline and during follow-up is not modified by and is moderately mediated by incident CVD.

12,excluded,Pairwise comparison of soil organic particle-size distributions in native savannas and eucalyptus plantations in congo,"Conversion of native vegetation into fast-growing tree plantations is known to affect soil organic matter (SOM): soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content and their distribution in particle-size fractions can be modified in various ways depending on numerous factors, such as soil properties, SOM levels prior to conversion, climatic conditions, silvicultural practices and fire occurrence. Since 1978, 43,000 ha of clonal eucalyptus plantations have been established on sandy coastal plains under savannas near Pointe-Noire, Congo. We investigated the effects of afforestation on topsoil (0-10 cm) C and N through the analysis of their distribution in particle-size fractions using a pairwise experimental design that compared adjacent savannas and plantations. The studied plantations were of different ages (2-30-year-old stands) and differently affected by accidental fires. No significant difference in total topsoil C, N or C/N was observed between young plantations and savanna. In old plantations that had not been affected by fire, total topsoil C content was twice as high as in savanna (p = 0.0016), on average, mostly involving fractions > 50 mu m. By contrast, total topsoil N did not differ significantly at these sites. In old plantations affected by fire, total topsoil C content did not differ significantly from that in savanna, but total topsoil N was 26% lower in plantations than in savanna (p = 0.0063), on average, and the decrease affected fractions < 200 mu m especially. Whatever the fire occurrence, total topsoil C/N was higher in old plantations than in savanna, in fractions > 20 mu m especially. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
13,excluded,Sequence recombination improves target specificity in a redesigned collagen peptide abc-type heterotrimer,"Stability of the collagen triple helix is largely governed by its imino acid content, namely the occurrence of proline and 4R-hydroxyproline at the X and Y positions, respectively, of the periodic (Gly-X-Y)n sequence. Although other amino acids at these positions reduce stability of the triple helix, this can be partially compensated by introducing intermolecular side-chain salt bridges. This approach was previously used to design an abc-type heterotrimer composed of one basic, one acidic, and one neutral imino acid rich chain (Gauba and Hartgerink, J Am Chem Soc 2007;129:1503415041). In this study, an abc-type heterotrimer was designed to be the most stable species using a sequence recombination strategy that preserved both the amino acid composition and the network of interchain salt bridges of the original design. The target heterotrimer had the highest Tm of 50 degrees C, 7 degrees C greater than the next most stable species. Stability of the heterotrimer decreased with increasing ionic strength, consistent with the role of intermolecular salt bridges in promoting stability. Quantitative meta-analysis of these results and published stability measurements on closely related peptides was used to discriminate the contributions of backbone propensity and side-chain electrostatics to collagen stability.

14,included,Grazing intensity significantly affects belowground carbon and nitrogen cycling in grassland ecosystems: a meta-analysis,"Livestock grazing activities potentially alter ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles in grassland ecosystems. Despite the fact that numerous individual studies and a few meta-analyses had been conducted, how grazing, especially its intensity, affects belowground C and N cycling in grasslands remains unclear. In this study, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of 115 published studies to examine the responses of 19 variables associated with belowground C and N cycling to livestock grazing in global grasslands. Our results showed that, on average, grazing significantly decreased belowground C and N pools in grassland ecosystems, with the largest decreases in microbial biomass C and N (21.62% and 24.40%, respectively). In contrast, belowground fluxes, including soil respiration, soil net N mineralization and soil N nitrification increased by 4.25%, 34.67% and 25.87%, respectively, in grazed grasslands compared to ungrazed ones. More importantly, grazing intensity significantly affected the magnitude (even direction) of changes in the majority of the assessed belowground C and N pools and fluxes, and C : N ratio as well as soil moisture. Specifically, light grazing contributed to soil C and N sequestration whereas moderate and heavy grazing significantly increased C and N losses. In addition, soil depth, livestock type and climatic conditions influenced the responses of selected variables to livestock grazing to some degree. Our findings highlight the importance of the effects of grazing intensity on belowground C and N cycling, which may need to be incorporated into regional and global models for predicting effects of human disturbance on global grasslands and assessing the climate-biosphere feedbacks.",carbon sequestration; CO2 emission; heavy grazing; mineralization; soil microbial biomass

16,included,A global synthesis of below-ground carbon responses to biotic disturbance: a meta-analysis,"AimClimate change, especially the wider occurrence of extreme events, is likely to increase the intensity and frequency of insect/pathogen outbreaks (referred to as biotic disturbance), which may considerably affect plant ecophysiological traits and thus the ecosystem carbon (C) cycle. Little is known, however, about the ways in which biotic disturbance quantitatively affects ecosystem C processes, especially those that occur below ground. We reveal the general patterns of below-ground C responses to biotic disturbance from field manipulative experiments and opportunistic events. LocationGlobal. MethodWe carried out a meta-analysis examining the effects of biotic disturbance on 16 variables associated with below-ground C processes, based on 64 experimental studies. ResultsBiotic disturbance significantly decreased below-ground C pools with relatively long residence times (e.g. root biomass and soil organic carbon, SOC), but increased labile C pools (e.g. microbial biomass carbon, MBC; dissolved organic carbon, DOC), soil respiration (Rs) and its components, and microbial population sizes. Compared with the neutral or positive effects of other environmental changes on below-ground C pools and fluxes, biotic disturbance had a negative effect on plant biomass and SOC but a larger positive effect on MBC, DOC and Rs. Main conclusionsBiotic disturbance can have stronger impacts on below-ground C processes than other environmental changes, and the sensitive responses of soil labile C pools and C fluxes to biotic disturbance decrease long-term below-ground C sequestration. More research efforts are, however, needed to reduce the uncertainties in quantifying the effects of biotic disturbance and to improve forecasting of the feedback between the carbon cycle and climate.",Below-ground; DOC; insect; meta-analysis; pathogen; respiration; root; biomass; SOC
17,excluded,Effect of different agricultural practices on carbon emission and carbon stock in organic and conventional olive systems,"Agricultural practices, particularly land use, inputs and soil management, have a significant impact on the carbon cycle. Good management of agricultural practices may reduce carbon emissions and increase soil carbon sequestration. In this context, organic agricultural practices may have a positive role in mitigating environmental burden. Organic olive cultivation is increasing globally, particularly in Italy, which is ranked first worldwide for both organic olive production and cultivated area. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of agricultural practices in organic and conventional olive systems on global warming potential (GWP) from a life cycle perspective and to identify the hot spots in each system. The impacts assessed were associated with the efficiency of both systems at sequestering soil in order to calculate the net carbon flux. There was a higher environmental impact on GWP in the organic system because of higher global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from manure fertilisation rather than the synthetic foliar fertilisers used in the conventional system. However, manure was the main reason behind the higher soil organic carbon (SOC) content and soil carbon sequestration in the organic system. Fertilisation activity was the main contributor to carbon emissions, accounting for approximately 80% of total emissions in the organic system and 45% in the conventional system. Conversely, given the similarity of other factors (land use, residues management, soil cover) that may affect soil carbon content, manure was the primary contributor to increased SOC in the organic system, resulting in a higher efficiency of carbon sequestration in the soil following the addition of soil organic matter. The contribution of the manure to increased SOC compensated for the higher carbon emission from the organic system, resulting in higher negative net carbon flux in the organic versus the conventional system (-1.7 vs -0.52 t C ha(-1) year(-)1, respectively) and higher efficiency of CO2 mitigation in the organic system.",global warming potential; greenhouses gas emissions; net carbon flux; soil organic carbon

Recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF) is used topically in the treatment of diabetic lower-extremity ulcers. There have been few meta-analyses of the efficacy of rhPDGF in this treatment context. The aim of this study was to perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical efficacy of rhPDGF in the treatment of diabetic lower-extremity ulcers. Methods. We searched the MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Web of Knowledge databases up to April 30, 2014. Studies were identified and selected, and data were extracted by two independent reviewers. The primary efficacy outcome was complete healing rate. Adverse events were also assessed. The studies were evaluated for quality and publication bias. Results. A total of 6 randomized controlled trials including 992 patients were selected from 173 identified studies. The studies compared rhPDGF treatment in the context of standard of care (SOC) to placebo or SOC alone. In the absence of study heterogeneity, a fixed-effects model was performed, and the combined odds ratio (OR) indicated a significantly greater complete healing rate in patients treated with rhPDGF compared to placebo or SOC alone. The ORs ranged from 0.58 to 2.77, with a combined OR of 1.53 (95% CI = 1.14 to 2.04, p = 0.004). A sensitivity analysis (leave-one-out method) indicated good study reliability, and a funnel plot with Egger test showed no publication bias. Conclusion. These results indicate that rhPDGF is efficacious in the treatment of diabetic lower-extremity ulcers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
19,excluded,Response of soil respiration to grazing in an alpine meadow at three elevations in tibet,"Alpine meadows are one major type of pastureland on the Tibetan Plateau. However, few studies have evaluated the response of soil respiration (R-s) to grazing along an elevation gradient in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. Here three fenced enclosures were established in an alpine meadow at three elevations (i.e., 4313 m, 4513 m, and 4693 m) in July 2008. We measured R-s inside and outside the three fenced enclosures in July-September, 2010-2011. Topsoil (0-20 cm) samples were gathered in July, August, and September, 2011. There were no significant differences for R-s, dissolved organic C (DOC), and belowground root biomass (BGB) between the grazed and ungrazed soils. Soil respiration was positively correlated with soil organic C (SOC), microbial biomass (MBC), DOC, and BGB. In addition, both R-s and BGB increased with total N (TN), the ratio of SOC to TN, ammonium N (NH4+-N), and the ratio of NH4+-N to nitrate N. Our findings suggested that the negligible response of R-s to grazing could be directly attributed to that of respiration substrate and that soil N may indirectly affect R-s by its effect on BGB.",
20,included,The impact of swidden decline on livelihoods and ecosystem services in Southeast Asia: A review of the evidence from 1990 to 2015,"Global economic change and policy interventions are driving transitions from long-fallow swidden (LFS) systems to alternative land uses in Southeast Asia's uplands. This study presents a systematic review of how these transitions impact upon livelihoods and ecosystem services in the region. Over 17 000 studies published between 1950 and 2015 were narrowed, based on relevance and quality, to 93 studies for further analysis. Our analysis of land-use transitions from swidden to intensified cropping systems showed several outcomes: more households had increased overall income, but these benefits came at significant cost such as reductions of customary practice, socio-economic wellbeing, livelihood options, and staple yields. Examining the effects of transitions on soil properties revealed negative impacts on soil organic carbon, cation-exchange capacity, and aboveground carbon. Taken together, the proximate and underlying drivers of the transitions from LFS to alternative land uses, especially intensified perennial and annual cash cropping, led to significant declines in pre-existing livelihood security and the ecosystem services supporting this security. Our results suggest that policies imposing land-use transitions on upland farmers so as to improve livelihoods and environments have been misguided; in the context of varied land uses, swidden agriculture can support livelihoods and ecosystem services that will help buffer the impacts of climate change in Southeast Asia.",Alternative land uses; Ecosystem services; Livelihood security; Shifting cultivation; Southeast Asia
21,excluded,Grazing and no-till cropping impacts on nitrogen retention in dryland agroecosystems,"As the world's population increases, marginal lands such as drylands are likely to become more important for food production. One proven strategy for improving crop production in drylands involves shifting from conventional tillage to no-till to increase water use efficiency, especially when this shift is coupled with more intensive crop rotations. Practices such as no-till that reduce soil disturbance and increase crop residues may promote C and N storage in soil organic matter, thus promoting N retention and reducing N losses. By sampling soils 15 yr after a N-15 tracer addition, this study compared long-term soil N retention across several agricultural management strategies in current and converted shortgrass steppe ecosystems: grazed and ungrazed native grassland, occasionally mowed planted perennial grassland, and three cropping intensities of no-till dryland cropping. We also examined effects of the environmental variables site location and topography on N retention. Overall, the long-term soil N retention of > 18% in these managed semiarid ecosystems was high compared with published values for other cropped or grassland ecosystems. Cropping practices strongly influenced long-term N retention, with planted perennial grass systems retaining > 90% of N-15 in soil compared with 30% for croplands. Grazing management, topography, and site location had smaller effects on long-term N retention. Estimated 15-yr N losses were low for intact and cropped systems. This work suggests that semiarid perennial grass ecosystems are highly N retentive and that increased intensity of semiarid land management can increase the amount of protein harvested without increasing N losses.",
22,excluded,Physico-chemical properties and microbial responses in biochar-amended soils: mechanisms and future directions,"Soil microbial communities are responsive to biochar amendments. As the residence time of biochar in soil is expected to be hundreds to thousands of years, the changes in microbial community structure and functions could persist for a long period of time. Given that biochar is being applied as a soil amendment in many parts of the world, the long-term consequences for soil microbial communities need to be considered. The objective of this review is to document how biochar creates new habitats and changes the soil environment for microorganisms, which may lead to changes in microbial abundance, community structure and activities. Our meta-analysis revealed that slow pyrolyzed biochars produced from various feedstocks at temperatures from 300 degrees C to 600 degrees C consistently increased some physicochemical properties (i.e., pH, cation exchange capacity and aggregation) and microbial parameters (i.e., abundance and community structure of microorganisms) in a vast number of soils during short (<= 90 days) laboratory incubations and longer (1-3 years) field studies. The biochar-mediated changes in soil physico-chemical and biological properties appeared to be a function of soil texture and biochar type based on its feedstock and production temperature, which determines key biochar characteristics such as surface area, porosity and pH. Biochars derived from manure or crop residue feedstocks tend to promote microbial abundance more than wood-derived biochars. Biochars derived from wood and other lignocellulosic-rich feedstocks tend to exhibit beneficial effects on soil microbial abundance later (>= 60 days) than biochars from manure or crop residue feedstocks. Coarse textured soils tend to have less aggregation, lower microbial biomass and lower enzyme activities when amended with slow pyrolyzed biochars produced at high temperatures (>600 degrees C), but these biochars did not affect the physico-chemical and biological properties of clayey soils. Further research is needed to evaluate the magnitude of biochar influence on soil microbial abundance and activities considering (1) the biochar particle size, surface area, porosity, nutrient content and pH, and (2) the soil organic matter (SOM) content and microbial abundance of the soil matrix. Once the microbial activities in the biochar-soil system are understood, they can be manipulated through organic and inorganic fertilizer applications to sustain or improve agricultural crop production.

23,included,Effect size and duration of recommended management practices on carbon sequestration in paddy field in Yangtze Delta Plain of China: A meta-analysis,"Increasing evidence has shown that recommended management practices (RMPs) benefit carbon sequestration in cropland soils, but the differences in the effect size and duration between RMPs are not well documented, especially in paddy fields where multiple cropping systems are in use. In order to select feasible techniques and develop effective strategies for soil organic carbon (SOC) management for long-term sustainable rice production that promote environmental health, we conducted a meta-analysis to compare the carbon sequestration effects based on size and duration of several common RMPs; using in the Yangtze Delta Plain of eastern China. The meta-analysis data base included 26 long-term field experiments with 86 paired trials. The mean depth of soil sampling in all trials was 16.5 cm. Results showed that there were significant effects from applications of crop residue and animal manure applications on levels of carbon sequestration. Crop residue additions and animal manure applications increased SOC by 0.41 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 0.34 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) on average during the experiment period, respectively. In contrast, reduced/no tillage practices had no effect on levels of carbon sequestration in the study area. Crop residue additions and animal manure applications will enhance SOC, but only over periods of about 20 and 40 years, respectively. Significantly greater effect of RMPs on carbon sequestration occurred in a triple cropping system incorporating with double rice than that in double cropping system with only a single rice season. The above results suggest that increases in organic matter, such as additions of crop residues and animal manure to soils may have great effects on carbon sequestration in paddy fields in the research area.

24,excluded,Soil contribution to carbon budget of russian forests,"The flux of CO2 from the soil to the atmosphere-soil respiration (Rs), is one of the least known components of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Rs depends on many factors and varies substantially in time and space. High uncertainty of Rs flux valuation leads to a wide range of reported carbon budget estimates for Russian forests. We developed a modeling system for assessing soil carbon stock and heterotrophic soil respiration based on a possible maximum of relevant input indicators. The most comprehensive databases of R-s in situ measurements focused on Northern Eurasia (780 records for the region) has been used. A statistical model for assessing R-s of Russian forests and its separation in autotrophic and heterotrophic parts were elaborated based on in situ measurements, climate parameters, soil and land cover datasets. The spatial resolution of the model is 1 km(2). Russian forest soil accumulated 144.5 Pg C (or 17.6 kg C m(-2)) in 1 m depth, including 8.3 Pg C (or 1.0 kg C m(-2)) in the labile topsoil organic layer. The total heterotrophic soil respiration (R-H) flux for the Russian forest is estimated at 1.7 Pg Cyr(-1) (206 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) that comprises 65% of Net Primary Production (NPP) and together with NPP is one of two major components of the net ecosystem carbon balance comprising on average 546 Tg Cyr(-1) (66 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) for 2007-2009. Interannual variability or RH in 1996-2005 was estimated at 4.1% for forests of the whole country and typically from 5 to 11% for large individual regions with an average linear trend +0.2% per year.

With the validation of the recent classification systems, RIFLE in 2004 and KDIGO, in use today, our understanding of AKI has evolved. We now know that community-acquired AKI is also associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes. In addition, several epidemiological studies, including cohorts from low-income and low-middle income countries, have confirmed common risk factors for community-acquired AKI. In 2013, the International Society of Nephrology launched the 0 by 25 campaign with the goal that no patient should die from preventable or untreated AKI in low-resource areas by 2025 [Mehta et al.: Lancet 2015; 385: 2616-43]. The initial effort of the initiative was a meta-analysis of AKI epidemiology around the world. The second project of the 0 by 25 initiative, the Global AKI Snapshot (GSN) study, provided insights into the recognition, treatment, and outcomes of AKI worldwide [Mehta et al.: Lancet 2016; 387: 2017-25]. Following the GSN, a Pilot Project was designed to test whether education and a simple protocol-based approach can improve outcomes in patients at risk of community-acquired AKI in low-resource settings [Macedo: J Am Soc Nephrol 2017].

27,excluded,Predicting potential impacts of climate change on the geographical distribution of enchytraeids: a meta-analysis approach,"The expectation that atmospheric warming will be most pronounced at higher latitudes means that Arctic and montane systems, with predominantly organic soils, will be particularly influenced by climate change. One group of soil fauna, the enchytraeids, is commonly the major soil faunal component in specific biomes, frequently exceeding above-ground fauna in biomass terms. These organisms have a crucial role in carbon turnover in organic rich soils and seem particularly sensitive to temperature changes. In order to predict the impacts of climate change on this important group of soil organisms we reviewed data from 44 published papers using a combination of conventional statistical techniques and meta-analysis. We focused on the effects of abiotic factors on total numbers of enchytraeids (a total of 611 observations) and, more specifically, concentrated on total numbers, vertical distribution and age groupings of the well-studied species Cognettia sphagnetorum (228 observations). The results highlight the importance of climatic factors, together with vegetation and soil type in determining global enchytraeid distribution; in particular, cold and wet environments with mild summers are consistently linked to greater densities of enchytraeids. Based on the upper temperature distribution limits reported in the literature, and identified from our meta-analyses, we also examined the probable future geographical limits of enchytraeid distribution in response to predicted global temperature changes using the HadCM3 model climate output for the period between 2010 and 2100. Based on the existing data we identify that a maximum mean annual temperature threshold of 16 degrees C could be a critical limit for present distribution of field populations, above which their presence would decline markedly, with certain key species, such as C. sphagnetorum, being totally lost from specific regions. We discuss the potential implications for carbon turnover in these organic soils where these organisms currently dominate and, consequently, their future role as C sink/source in response to climate change.",
28,included,"A meta-analysis of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus change in response to conversion of grassland to agricultural land","The conversion of grassland to agricultural land is an important land use change that affects soil stocks and concentrations of C, N and P, as well as their stoichiometric ratios. However, the response mechanism of soil C, N and P change to grassland conversion remains unclear. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 92 studies and showed that the C and N stocks mainly depended on soil depth, conversion duration and precipitation, while the P response was insensitive to these factors. Moreover, C, N and P losses were also correlated with soil physical–chemical properties (pH, sand, silt, clay). Changes in the response ratios of C:N, C:P and N:P indicated that soil C and N were more sensitive than P to grassland conversion. These results suggest that land use management policies should protect natural grasslands, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions, to minimize soil C, N and P loss.",Carbon; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Meta-analysis; Grassland conversion; Land-use change
29,included,Which agroforestry options give the greatest soil and above ground carbon benefits in different world regions?,"Climate change mitigation and food security are two of the main challenges of human society. Agroforestry systems, defined as the presence of trees on external and internal boundaries, cropland, or on any other available niche of farmland, can provide both climate change mitigation and food. There are several types of agroforestry systems with different rates of above ground and soil carbon (C) sequestration. The amount of carbon sequestered can depend on the type of system, climate, time since land use change and previous land use. Data was collected from a total of 86 published and peer reviewed studies on soil and above ground carbon sequestration for different agroforestry systems, climates and regions in the world. The objective was to understand which agroforestry systems provide the greatest benefits, and what are the main factors influencing, soil and above ground carbon sequestration. The results show that, on average, more soil carbon sequestration occurs in agroforestry systems classified as silvopastoral (4.38 tC ha(-1) yr(-1)), and more above ground carbon sequestration occurs in improved fellows (11.29 tC ha(-1) yr(-1)). On average, carbon benefits are greater in agroforestry systems Tropical climates when compared to agroforestry systems located in other climates, both in terms of soil (2.23 tC ha(-1) yr(-1)) and above ground (4.85 tC ha(-1) yr(-1)). In terms of land use change, the greatest above ground carbon sequestration (12.8 tC ha(-1) yr(-1)) occurs when degraded land is replaced by improved fallow and the greatest soil carbon sequestration (4.38 tC ha(-1) yr(-1)) results from the transition of a grassland system to a silvopastoral system. Time since the change is implemented was the main factor influencing above ground carbon sequestration, while climate mainly influences soil carbon sequestration most. The results of the analysis may be used to inform practitioners and policy makers on the most effective agroforestry system for carbon sequestration. The lack of data on carbon stocks before the implementation land use change and the lack of reporting on soil sampling design and variances were the main limitations in the data. The need to report this data should be considered in future studies if agroforestry systems are expected to play an important role as a climate change mitigation strategy.",Climate change; Meta-analysis; Mitigation; Trees; Agriculture
30,excluded,S3 guideline: endocrine therapy of primary breast cancer,"Endocrine therapy is the most effective targeted treatment option in the adjuvant setting for endocrine responsive breast cancer. In general, the duration of treatment with initial adjuvant therapy (IAT) is 5 years. In the case of increased risk of recurrence, it can be extended for 6-10 years as extended adjuvant therapy (EAT). Patients with a positive hormone receptor status for estrogen and/or progesterone receptors (ER and/or PR) of the primary tumor are candidates for this treatment and should be offered this therapy. In premenopausal women tamoxifen treatment, which in the case of contraindications is replaced by gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa), for 5 years is the standard of care (SoC). Only in the case of increased risk of relapse, with continued ovarian function, an age younger than 35 years and after adjuvant chemotherapy should tamoxifen or if contraindicated an aromatase inhibitor in combination with GnRHa be given. An EAT with tamoxifen can be extended to 10 years in the case of increased risk of recurrence. In postmenopausal patients endocrine adjuvant therapy consists of an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years, especially in high-risk patients with a lobular invasive breast cancer, alternatively a classical or inverse sequence therapy combining tamoxifen followed by an aromatase inhibitor can be carried out. The EAT can be extended with tamoxifen for 2aEuro5 years or an aromatase inhibitor when the menopause has begun. If an adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated, the endocrine therapy is subsequently initiated.

31,excluded,Mitigation potential of soil carbon management overestimated by neglecting n2o emissions,"International initiatives such as the '4 per 1000' are promoting enhanced carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural soils as a way to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions1. However, changes in soil organic C turnover feed back into the nitrogen (N) cycle(2), meaning that variation in soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions may offset or enhance C sequestration actions(3). Here we use a biogeochemistry model on approximately 8,000 soil sampling locations in the European Union(4) to quantify the net CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e) fluxes associated with representative C-mitigating agricultural practices. Practices based on integrated crop residue retention and lower soil disturbance are found to not increase N2O emissions as long as C accumulation continues (until around 2040), thereafter leading to a moderate C sequestration offset mostly below 47% by 2100. The introduction of N-fixing cover crops allowed higher C accumulation over the initial 20 years, but this gain was progressively offset by higher N2O emissions over time. By 2060, around half of the sites became a net source of greenhouse gases. We conclude that significant CO2 mitigation can be achieved in the initial 20-30 years of any C management scheme, but after that N inputs should be controlled through appropriate management.",
32,excluded,Short-term contributions of cover crop surface residue return to soil carbon and nitrogen contents in temperate australia,"Cover crop species are usually grown to control weeds. After cover crop harvest, crop residue is applied on the ground to improve soil fertility and crop productivity. Little information is available about quantifying the contributions of cover crop application to soil total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in temperate Australia. Here, we selected eight cover crop treatments, including two legume crops (vetch and field pea), four non-legume crops (rye, wheat, Saia oat, and Indian mustard), a mixture of rye and vetch, and a nil-crop control in temperate Australia to calculate the contributions of cover crops (crop growth + residue decomposition) to soil C and N contents. Cover crops were sown in May 2009 (autumn). After harvest, the crop residue was placed on the soil surface in October 2009. Soil and crop samples were collected in October 2009 after harvest and in May 2010 after 8 months of residue decomposition. We examined cover crop residue biomass, soil and crop total C and N contents, and soil microbial biomass C and N contents. The results showed that cover crop application increased the mean soil total C by 187-253 kg ha(-1) and the mean soil total N by 16.3-19.1 kg ha(-1) relative to the nil-crop treatment, except for the mixture treatment, which had similar total C and N contents to the nil-crop control. Cover crop application increased the mean soil microbial biomass C by 15.5-20.9 kg ha(-1) and the mean soil microbial biomass N by 4.5-10.2 kg ha(-1). We calculated the apparent percentage of soil total C derived from cover crop residue C losses and found that legume crops accounted for 10.6-13.9 %, whereas non-legume crops accounted for 16.4-18.4 % except for the mixture treatment (0.2 %). Overall, short-term cover crop application increased soil total C and N contents and microbial biomass C and N contents, which might help reduce N fertilizer use and improve sustainable agricultural development.",Cover crops; Soil total C; Soil total N; Microbial biomass C; Microbial biomass N
33,excluded,Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in naturally assembled communities,"Approximately 25 years ago, ecologists became increasingly interested in the question of whether ongoing biodiversity loss matters for the functioning of ecosystems. As such, a new ecological subfield on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning (BEF) was born. This subfield was initially dominated by theoretical studies and by experiments in which biodiversity was manipulated, and responses of ecosystem functions such as biomass production, decomposition rates, carbon sequestration, trophic interactions and pollination were assessed. More recently, an increasing number of studies have investigated BEF relationships in non-manipulated ecosystems, but reviews synthesizing our knowledge on the importance of real-world biodiversity are still largely missing. I performed a systematic review in order to assess how biodiversity drives ecosystem functioning in both terrestrial and aquatic, naturally assembled communities, and on how important biodiversity is compared to other factors, including other aspects of community composition and abiotic conditions. The outcomes of 258 published studies, which reported 726 BEF relationships, revealed that in many cases, biodiversity promotes average biomass production and its temporal stability, and pollination success. For decomposition rates and ecosystem multifunctionality, positive effects of biodiversity outnumbered negative effects, but neutral relationships were even more common. Similarly, negative effects of prey biodiversity on pathogen and herbivore damage outnumbered positive effects, but were less common than neutral relationships. Finally, there was no evidence that biodiversity is related to soil carbon storage. Most BEF studies focused on the effects of taxonomic diversity, however, metrics of functional diversity were generally stronger predictors of ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, in most studies, abiotic factors and functional composition (e.g. the presence of a certain functional group) were stronger drivers of ecosystem functioning than biodiversity per se. While experiments suggest that positive biodiversity effects become stronger at larger spatial scales, in naturally assembled communities this idea is too poorly studied to draw general conclusions. In summary, a high biodiversity in naturally assembled communities positively drives various ecosystem functions. At the same time, the strength and direction of these effects vary highly among studies, and factors other than biodiversity can be even more important in driving ecosystem functioning. Thus, to promote those ecosystem functions that underpin human well-being, conservation should not only promote biodiversity per se, but also the abiotic conditions favouring species with suitable trait combinations.",biodiversity; community composition; context dependence; ecosystem functioning; ecosystem multifunctionality; environment; global change; land use; spatial scale
34,excluded,Grain legume-based rotations managed under conventional tillage need cover crops to mitigate soil organic matter losses,"Inserting legumes in low-input innovative cropping systems can represent a good strategy to reduce current N fertilizer dependency while enhancing ecosystem services. However, although the impact of the use of legumes as cover crops has been broadly studied, very little is known about the effects of grain legume-based rotations on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SON). A cropping system experiment with three 3-year rotations with different levels of inclusion of grain legumes: GLO, GL1 and GL2 (none, one, and two grain legumes, respectively), with (CC) or without (BF, bare fallow) cover crops was established in SW France (Auzeville) under temperate climate. Durum wheat was present in all the rotations to act as an indicator of their performance. Soil organic C and SON were quantified before the beginning of the experiment and after 3 and 6 years (i.e., after one and two complete 3-yr rotations). Aboveground C and N inputs to the soil, and C and N harvest indexes and grain yield of the cash crops were also measured. Inserting grain legumes in the rotations significantly affected the amount of C and N inputs and consequently SOC and SON. After two cycles of the 3-yr rotation, the GL1 and GL2 treatments showed a greater decrease in SOC and SON when compared to GLO. However, the inclusion of cover crops in the rotations led to mitigate this loss. Durum wheat produced significantly greater grain yields in GU when compared to GLO, while GL2 presented intermediate values. In turn, the incorporation of cover crops did not reduce C and N harvest indexes or the grain yield of the different cash crops. We concluded that, in such conventionally-tilled grain legume-based rotations, the use of cover crops was efficient to mitigate SOC and SON losses and then increase N use efficiency at the cropping system level without reducing productivity.

Here, we synthesise data from 633 published studies to show how the interactive effects of multiple drivers are generally additive (i.e. not differing from the sum of their individual effects) rather than synergistic or antagonistic. We further show that (1) elevated CO2, warming, N addition, P addition and increased rainfall, all exerted positive individual effects on plant C pools at both single-plant and plant-community levels; (2) plant C pool responses to individual or combined effects of multiple drivers are seldom scale-dependent (i.e. not differing from single-plant to plant-community levels) and (3) soil and microbial biomass C pools are significantly less sensitive than plant C pools to individual or combined effects. We provide a quantitative basis for integrating additive effects of multiple global change drivers into future assessments of the C storage ability of terrestrial ecosystems.",Additive interaction; drought; elevated CO2; increased rainfall; nitrogen addition; phosphorus addition; warming
36,excluded,Environmental effects of short-rotation woody crops for bioenergy: What is and isn't known,"Logging and mill residues are currently the largest sources of woody biomass for bioenergy in the United States, but short-rotation woody crops (SRWCs) are expected to become a larger contributor to biomass production, primarily on lands marginal for food production. However, there are very few studies on the environmental effects of SRWCs, and most have been conducted at stand rather than at watershed scales. In this manuscript, we review the potential environmental effects of SRWCs relative to current forestry or agricultural practices and best management practices (BMPs) in the southeast United States and identify priorities and constraints for monitoring and modeling these effects. Plot-scale field studies and a watershed-scale modeling study found improved water quality with SRWCs compared to agricultural crops. Further, a recent watershed-scale experiment suggests that conventional forestry BMPs are sufficient to protect water quality from SRWC silvicultural activities, but the duration of these studies is short with respect to travel times of groundwater transporting nitrate to streams. While the effects of SRWC production on carbon (C) and water budgets depend on both soil properties and previous land management, woody crops will typically sequester more C when compared with agricultural crops. The overall C offset by SRWCs will depend on a variety of management practices, the number of rotations, and climate. Effects of SRWCs on biodiversity, especially aquatic organisms, are not well studied, but a meta-analysis found that bird and mammal biodiversity is lower in SRWC stands than unmanaged forests. Long-term (i.e., over multiple rotations) water quality, water use, C dynamics, and soil quality studies are needed, as are larger-scale (i.e., landscape scale) biodiversity studies, to evaluate the potential effects of SRWC production. Such research should couple field measurement and modeling approaches due to the temporal (i.e., multiple rotations) and spatial (i.e., heterogeneous landscape) scaling issues involved with SRWC production.",aquatic macroinvertebrates; best management practices; bioenergy; carbon/water tradeoffs; hydrologic modeling; soil organic carbon; southeastern United States; terrestrial biodiversity; water quality; woody feedstocks
37,excluded,Global drivers and patterns of microbial abundance in soil,"Aim While soil microorganisms play key roles in Earth's biogeochemical cycles, methodological constraints and sparse data have hampered our ability to describe and understand the global distribution of soil microbial biomass. Here, we present a comprehensive quantification of the environmental drivers of soil microbial biomass. Location Global. Methods We used a comprehensive global dataset of georeferenced soil microbial biomass estimates and high-resolution climatic and soil data. Results We show that microbial biomass carbon (C-Mic) is primarily driven by moisture availability, with this single variable accounting for 34% of the global variance. For the microbial carbon-to-soil organic carbon ratio (C-Mic/C-Org), soil nitrogen content was an equally important driver as moisture. In contrast, temperature was not a significant predictor of microbial biomass patterns at a global scale, while temperature likely has an indirect effect on microbial biomass by influencing rates of evapotranspiration and decomposition. As our models explain an unprecedented 50% of the global variance of C-Mic and C-Mic/C-Org, we were able to leverage gridded environmental information to build the first spatially explicit global estimates of microbial biomass and quantified the global soil microbial carbon pool to equal 14.6 Pg C. Main Conclusions Our unbiased models allowed us to build the first global spatially explicit predictions of microbial biomass. These patterns show that soil microbial biomass is not primarily driven by temperature, but instead, biomass is more heterogeneous through the effects of moisture availability and soil nutrients. Our global estimates provide important data for integration into large-scale carbon and nutrient models that may imply a major step forward in our ability to predict the global carbon balance, now and in a future climate.",
38,included,Global soil acidification impacts on belowground processes,"With continuous nitrogen (N) enrichment and sulfur (S) deposition, soil acidification has accelerated and become a global environmental issue. However, a full understanding of the general pattern of ecosystem belowground processes in response to soil acidification due to the impacting factors remains elusive. We conducted a meta-analysis of soil acidification impacts on belowground functions using 304 observations from 49 independent studies, mainly including soil cations, soil nutrient, respiration, root and microbial biomass. Our results show that acid addition significantly reduced soil pHby 0.24 on average, with less pH decrease in forest than non-forest ecosystems. The response ratio of soilpH was positively correlated with site precipitation and temperature, but negatively with initial soil pH. Soil base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+) decreased while non-base cations (Al3+, Fe3+) increased with soil acidification. Soil respiration, fine root biomass, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen were significantly reduced by 14.7%, 19.1%, 9.6% and 12.1%, respectively, under acid addition. These indicate that soil carbon processes are sensitive to soil acidification. Overall, our meta-analysis suggests a strong negative impact of soil acidification on belowground functions, with the potential to suppress soil carbon emission. It also arouses our attention to the toxic effects of soil ions on terrestrial ecosystems.",acid deposition; soil cations; meta-analysis; soil pH; soil respiration; microbes
39,excluded,Application of the dndc model to tile-drained illinois agroecosystems: model comparison of conventional and diversified rotations,"Using the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model we compare conventional, fertilizer-driven corn-soybean rotations to alternative management scenarios which include the management of cereal rye cover crops and corn-soybean-wheat-red clover rotations. We conduct our analysis for tile-drained, silty clay loam soils of Illinois. DNDC simulations suggest that, relative to conventional rotations, a nitrate leaching reduction of 30-50% under corn and of 15-50% under soybean crops can be achieved with diversified rotations, an outcome which corroborates results from a quantitative literature review we previously conducted using a meta-analysis framework. Additionally, over a 10-year simulation, legume-fertilized systems are predicted to result in 52% lower N2O gas flux relative to fertilizer-driven systems. We identify soil organic carbon storage, legume N-fixation rate, and cereal rye cover crop growth as areas requiring further development to accurately apply DNDC to diversified cropping systems. Overall, DNDC simulation suggests diversified rotations that alternate winter and summer annuals have the potential to dramatically increase N retention in agroecosystems.",
40,included,Three decades of soil microbial biomass studies in Brazilian ecosystems: Lessons learned about soil quality and indications for improving sustainability,"Soil microbial biomass plays important roles in nutrient cycling, plant-pathogen suppression, decomposition of residues and degradation of pollutants; therefore, it is often regarded as a good indicator of soil quality. We reviewed more than a hundred studies in which microbial biomass-C (MB-C), microbial quotient (MB-C/TSOC, total soil organic carbon) and metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) were evaluated with the objective of understanding MB-C responses to various soil-management practices in Brazilian ecosystems. These practices included tillage systems, crop rotations, pastures, organic farming, inputs of industrial residues and urban sewage sludge, applications of agrochemicals and burning. With a metaanalysis of 233 data points, we confirmed the benefits of no-tillage in preserving MB-C and reducing qCO(2) in comparison to conventional tillage. A large number of studies described increases in MB-C and MB-C/TSOC due to permanent organic farming, also benefits from crop rotations particularly with several species involved, whereas application of agrochemicals and burning severely disturbed soil microbial communities. The MB-C decreased in overgrazed pastures, but increased in pastures rotated with well-managed crops. Responses of MB-C, MB-C/TSOC and qCO(2) to amendment with organic industrial residues varied with residue type, dose applied and soil texture. In conclusion, MB-C and related parameters were, indeed, useful indicators of soil quality in various Brazilian ecosystems. However, direct relationships between MB-C and nutrient-cycling dynamics, microbial diversity and functionality are still unclear.

41,excluded,Effect of visit-to-visit blood pressure variability on cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease and well-controlled blood pressure,"This post hoc analysis of CAMELOT and PREVENT analyzed the impact of blood pressure variability (BPV, assessed as within-subject standard deviation of SBP from 12 weeks onward) on the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, defined according to original studies). Patients (n = 1677 CAMELOT; n = 776 PREVENT) were stratified by BPV quartile. Regardless of study, BPV was significantly lower for amlodipine versus other treatments. In CAMELOT, a significant association between BPV quartile and MACE was observed with amlodipine treatment. Significant associations between BPV quartile and MACE were observed for both studies, when analyzed overall (adjusting for treatment). In CAMELOT, with amlodipine treatment, an increased risk for MACE was observed with high (BPV >= Q3) versus low BPV (< Q1; adjusting for characteristics and risk factors). In both studies, increased risk for MACE was observed for BPV >= Q3 versus BPV < Q1 (analyzed overall, adjusting for treatment and covariates). For both studies, BPV, but not mean SBP, was associated with cardiovascular events. BPV was associated with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CAD and well controlled BP.

42,included,Organic amendment additions to rangelands: A meta-analysis of multiple ecosystem outcomes,"Interest in land application of organic amendments-such as biosolids, composts, and manures-is growing due to their potential to increase soil carbon and help mitigate climate change, as well as to support soil health and regenerative agriculture. While organic amendments are predominantly applied to croplands, their application is increasingly proposed on relatively arid rangelands that do not typically receive fertilizers or other inputs, creating unique concerns for outcomes such as native plant diversity and water quality. To maximize environmental benefits and minimize potential harms, we must understand how soil, water, and plant communities respond to particular amendments and site conditions. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 92 studies in which organic amendments had been added to arid, semiarid, or Mediterranean rangelands. We found that organic amendments, on average, provide some environmental benefits (increased soil carbon, soil water holding capacity, aboveground net primary productivity, and plant tissue nitrogen; decreased runoff quantity), as well as some environmental harms (increased concentrations of soil lead, runoff nitrate, and runoff phosphorus; increased soil CO2 emissions). Published data were inadequate to fully assess impacts to native plant communities. In our models, adding higher amounts of amendment benefitted four outcomes and harmed two outcomes, whereas adding amendments with higher nitrogen concentrations benefitted two outcomes and harmed four outcomes. This suggests that trade-offs among outcomes are inevitable; however, applying low-N amendments was consistent with both maximizing benefits and minimizing harms. Short study time frames (median 1-2 years), limited geographic scope, and, for some outcomes, few published studies limit longer-term inferences from these models. Nevertheless, they provide a starting point to develop site-specific amendment application strategies aimed toward realizing the potential of this practice to contribute to climate change mitigation while minimizing negative impacts on other environmental goals.",arid; biodiversity; biosolids; climate change; compost; ecosystem services; grassland; runoff; savanna; soil carbon
43,excluded,Factors affecting sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic testing: dobutamine stress echocardiography,"Background: Clinical characteristics of patients, angiographic referral bias, and several technical factors may all affect the reported diagnostic accuracy of tests. The aim of this study was to assess their influence on the diagnostic accuracy of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE). Methods: The medical literature from 1991 to 2006 was searched for diagnostic studies using DSE and meta-analysis was applied to the 62 studies thus retrieved, including 6881 patients. These studies were analyzed for patient characteristics, angiographic referral bias, and several technical factors. Results: The sensitivity of DSE was significantly related to the inclusion of patients with prior myocardial infarctions (0.834 vs 0.740, P < .01) and defining the results of DSE as already positive in case of resting wall motion abnormalities rather than obligatory myocardial ischemia (0.786 vs 0.864, P < .01). Specificity tended to be lower when patients with resting wall motion abnormalities were included in a study (0.812 vs 0.877, P < .10). The presence of referral bias adversely affected the specificity of DSE (0.771 vs 0.842, P < .01). Conclusion: This analysis suggests that the reported sensitivity of DSE is likely higher and the specificity lower than expected in routine clinical practice because of the inappropriate inclusion of patients with prior myocardial infarctions, the definition of positive results on DSE, and the negative influence of referral bias. However, in the patient subset that will be sent to coronary angiography, the opposite results can be expected. (J Am Soc Echocardiogr 2009;22:1199-208.)",
44,excluded,Changes in soil organic carbon and its density fractions after shrub-planting for desertification control,"Planting shrubs on sand land and degraded pasture are two main measures for desertification control particularly in northwest China. However, their effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) and its fractions remain uncertain. We assessed the changes in stocks of SOC, light fraction of SOC (LF-SOC) and heavy fraction of SOC (HF-SOC) after planting Artemisia ordosica (AO, 17 years), Astragalus mongolicum (AM, 5 years) and Salix psammophila (SP, 16 years) in sand land and planting Caragana microphylla (CM, 24 years) on degraded pasture. Results show that: 1) after planting AO, AM and SP on sand land, SOC stocks increased by 162.5%, 45.2% and 70.8%, respectively, and LF-SOC accounted for a large proportion in the increased SOC. Dry weights of LF-SOC, rather than carbon concentrations, were higher in shrublands than that in sand land; 2) after planting CM on degraded pasture, SOC stock decreased by 9.3% and all the loss was HF-SOC in 60-100 cm soil layer where both herbaceous fine root biomass (HFRB) and soil water content (SWC) also decreased. The results indicate that planting shrubs can result in an increase of SOC in sand land, whereas that can lead to a decrease of SOC in degraded pasture. The increase of SOC in sand land mainly bases on the accumulation of dry weight of LF-SOC. The loss of SOC in degraded pasture is caused by the decrease of carbon concentrations of HF-SOC, which can be related to the reduction of HFRB and SWC in deep soil layer. Therefore, shrub-planting for desertification control not always improve the quantity and stability of SOC in northwest China.",

We selected four important articles from 2017 that address these issues to annotate and critique, and we discuss the broader implications for optimizing medication use. A longer list of articles is given in an online appendix. The first study provides national data on the prevalence of central nervous system-active medication polypharmacy in older adults and how this has changed over a 9-year period (2004-2013). The second study characterizes prevalence of and factors associated with nonadherence to antiepileptic drugs in 36,912 older adults with epilepsy, with an emphasis on minorities. The third study describes the extent of antibiotic use in residents of 381 long-term care facilities (LTCF) in British Columbia, Canada, from 2007 to 2014. Finally, we discuss a meta-analysis of 42 studies that evaluated the prevalence of hospital admissions caused by adverse drug reactions in older adults.

46,included,"Biochar, soil and land-use interactions that reduce nitrate leaching and N2O emissions: A meta-analysis","Biochar can reduce both nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrate (NO3-) leaching, but refining biochar's use for estimating these types of losses remains elusive. For example, biochar properties such as ash content and labile organic compounds may induce transient effects that alter N-based losses. Thus, the aim of this meta-analysis was to assess interactions between biochar-induced effects on N2O emissions and NO3- retention, regarding the duration of experiments as well as soil and land use properties. Data were compiled from 88 peer-reviewed publications resulting in 608 observations up to May 2016 and corresponding response ratios were used to perform a random effects meta-analysis, testing biochar's impact on cumulative N2O emissions, soil NO3- concentrations and leaching in temperate, semi-arid, sub-tropical, and tropical climate. The overall N2O emissions reduction was 38%, but N2O emission reductions tended to be negligible after one year. Overall, soil NO3- concentrations remained unaffected while NO3- leaching was reduced by 13% with biochar; greater leaching reductions (>26%) occurred over longer experimental times (i.e. >30 days). Biochar had the strongest N2O emission reducing effect in paddy soils (Anthrosols) and sandy soils (Arenosols). The use of biochar reduced both N2O emissions and NO3- leaching in arable farming and horticulture, but it did not affect these losses in grasslands and perennial crops. In conclusion, the time-dependent impact on N2O emissions and NO3- leaching is a crucial factor that needs to be considered in order to develop and test resilient and sustainable biochar-based N loss mitigation strategies. Our results provide a valuable starting point for future biochar-based N loss mitigation studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted a systematic review of observational studies that described this risk. Design, setting, participants, & measurements We searched several databases from their date of inception through June 2010 for eligible articles published in any language. We included any study that reported maternal or fetal outcomes in at least five pregnant women in each group with or without CKD. We excluded pregnant women with a history of transplantation or maintenance dialysis. Results We identified 13 studies. Adverse maternal events including gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and maternal mortality were reported in 12 studies. There were 312 adverse maternal events among 2682 pregnancies in women with CKD (weighted average of 11.5%) compared with 500 events in 26,149 pregnancies in normal healthy women (weighted average of 2%). One or more adverse fetal outcomes such as premature births, intrauterine growth restriction, small for gestational age, neonatal mortality, stillbirths, and low birth weight were reported in nine of the included studies. Overall, the risk of developing an adverse fetal outcome was at least two times higher among women with CKD compared with those without. Conclusions This review summarizes current available evidence to guide physicians in their decision-making, advice, and care for pregnant women with CKD.

The latter is performed via either an eyebrow or an eyelid skin incision. The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the type and the incidence of approachrelated complications of these so-called ""keyhole craniotomies"". METHODS: We review pertinent articles retrieved by search in the PubMed/Medline database. Inclusion criteria were all full-text articles, abstracts, and posters in English, up to 2016, reporting clinical results. RESULTS: A total of 105 articles containing data on 5837 surgeries performed via a minipterional or either of the 2 variants of the SOC met the eligibility criteria. Pain on mastication was the most commonly reported approach-related complication of the minipterional approach, and occurred in 7.5% of cases. Temporary palsy of the frontal branch of the facial nerve and temporary supraorbital hypesthesia were associated with the SOC eyebrow variant, and occurred in 6.5%, respectively in 3.6% of cases. Transient postoperative periorbital edema and transient ophthalmoparesis occurred in 36.8% and 17.4% of cases, respectively, when the SOC was performed via an eyelid skin incision. The risk of occurrence of the latter 2 complications was related to the removal of the orbital rim, which is an obligatory part of the SOC approach through the eyelid but optional with the SOC eyebrow variant. CONCLUSIONS: Each of the 3 keyhole approaches has a specific set and incidence of approach-related complications.

49,excluded,Chlorhexidine bathing and health care-associated infections among adult intensive care patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Health care-associated infections (HAI) have been shown to increase length of stay, the cost of care, and rates of hospital deaths (Kaye and Marchaim, J Am Geriatr Soc 62(2): 306-11, 2014; Roberts and Scott, Med Care 48(11): 1026-35, 2010; Warren and Quadir, Crit Care Med 34(8): 2084-9, 2006; Zimlichman and Henderson, JAMA Intern Med 173(22): 2039-46, 2013). Importantly, infections acquired during a hospital stay have been shown to be preventable (Loveday and Wilson, J Hosp Infect 86: S1-70, 2014). In particular, due to more invasive procedures, mechanical ventilation, and critical illness, patients cared for in the intensive care unit (ICU) are at greater risk of HAI and associated poor outcomes. This meta-analysis aims to summarise the effectiveness of chlorhexidine (CHG) bathing, in adult intensive care patients, to reduce infection. Methods: A systematic literature search was undertaken to identify trials assessing the effectiveness of CHG bathing to reduce risk of infection, among adult intensive care patients. Infections included were: bloodstream infections; central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI); catheter-associated urinary tract infections; ventilator-associated pneumonia; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus; and Clostridium difficile. Summary estimates were calculated as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence/credible intervals. Variation in study designs was addressed using hierarchical Bayesian random-effects models. Results: Seventeen trials were included in our final analysis: seven of the studies were cluster-randomised crossover trials, and the remaining studies were before-and-after trials. CHG bathing was estimated to reduce the risk of CLABSI by 56% (Bayesian random effects IRR = 0.44 (95% credible interval (CrI), 0.26, 0.75)), and MRSA colonisation and bacteraemia in the ICU by 41% and 36%, respectively (IRR = 0.59 (95% CrI, 0.36, 0.94); and IRR = 0.64 (95% CrI, 0.43, 0.91)). The numbers needed to treat for these specific ICU infections ranged from 360 (CLABSI) to 2780 (MRSA bacteraemia). Conclusion: This meta-analysis of the effectiveness of CHG bathing to reduce infections among adults in the ICU has found evidence for the benefit of daily bathing with CHG to reduce CLABSI and MRSA infections. However, the effectiveness may be dependent on the underlying baseline risk of these events among the given ICU population. Therefore, CHG bathing appears to be of the most clinical benefit when infection rates are high for a given ICU population.",
50,excluded,Responses of soil microbial communities to water stress: results from a meta-analysis,"Soil heterotrophic respiration and nutrient mineralization are strongly affected by environmental conditions, in particular by moisture fluctuations triggered by rainfall events. When soil moisture decreases, so does decomposers' activity, with microfauna generally undergoing stress sooner than bacteria and fungi. Despite differences in the responses of individual decomposer groups to moisture availability (e.g., bacteria are typically more sensitive than fungi to water stress), we show that responses of decomposers at the community level are different in soils and surface litter, but similar across biomes and climates. This results in a nearly constant soil-moisture threshold corresponding to the point when biological activity ceases, at a water potential of about -14 MPa in mineral soils and -36 MPa in surface litter. This threshold is shown to be comparable to the soil moisture value where solute diffusion becomes strongly inhibited in soil, while in litter it is dehydration rather than diffusion that likely limits biological activity around the stress point. Because of these intrinsic constraints and lack of adaptation to different hydro-climatic regimes, changes in rainfall patterns (primary drivers of the soil moisture balance) may have dramatic impacts on soil carbon and nutrient cycling.",
51,excluded,Temporal niche differentiation increases the land equivalent ratio of annual intercrops: a meta-analysis,"Sustainable intensification of agriculture is needed to meet higher future food demands while mitigating agriculture's ecological footprint. Intercropping is a strategy for increasing agricultural productivity per unit land that is based on ecological mechanisms for improved resource capture. No quantitative synthesis has been made on the effect of intercrop system properties and species trait combinations on intercrop productivity. Here we use meta-analysis of the intercropping literature to study how the productivity of mixed systems is affected by intercrop system design and species traits. We focus on the effects of temporal niche differentiation between species, intercropping pattern, relative densities, the use of C3 and C4 species and the rate of nitrogen fertilizer. Land equivalent ratio (LER) is used as index for assessing the relative productivity of a mixed system as compared to sole crops. Average LER was 1.22 +/- 0.02, and no differences in LER were found between the 50 most highly cited studies and a random sample from the literature, indicating that high LERs in highly cited papers are representative of the entire literature. Temporal niche differentiation contributed substantially to high LER in systems combining a C3 and C4 species, but not in systems based on C3 species mixtures. The amount of N fertilizer interacted positively with the effect of temporal niche differentiation on LER. The intercropping literature is dominated by studies on cereal/legume mixtures. However, the few studies on C3 cereal/C4 cereal mixtures indicate these mixtures have high LER. Substantial improvements in land use efficiency in agriculture may be obtained by using mixtures, particularly C3/C4 mixtures. Thus, enhanced within-field crop diversity can make an important contribution to sustainable increases in food production. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

52,excluded,The phyllolepid placoderm cowralepis mclachlani: insights into the evolution of feeding mechanisms in jawed vertebrates,"Remarkably preserved specimens of Cowralepis mclachlani Ritchie, 2005 (Proc Linn Soc NSW 126:215-259) (Phyllolepida, Placodermi) represent a unique ontogenetic sequence adding to our understanding of anatomy, function, and phylogeny among basal jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes). A systematic review demonstrates that the Phyllolepida are a subgroup of the Arthrodira. Consideration of visceral and neurocranial characters supports the hypothesis that placoderms are the sister group to remaining gnathostomes. Placoderms possess, as adult plesiomorphic features, a number of characters that are only seen in the development of extant gnathostomes-a peramorphic shift relative to placoderms. Developmental evidence in vertebrates leads to a revised polarity of character transitions. These include 1) hyomandibula-neurocranium and ventral parachordal-palatoquadrate articulations (vertebrate synapomorphies); 2) jointed pharynx, paired basibranchials, anterior ethmoidal-palatoquadrate articulation, short trabeculae cranii, and anterior and posterior neurocranial fissures (gnathostome synapomorphies); and 3) fused basibranchials, dorsal palatoquadrate-neurocranium articulation, loss of the anterior neurocranial fissure, elongated trabeculae cranii, and transfer of the ventral parachordal-palatoquadrate articulation to the trabeculae (crown group gnathostomes). The level of preservation in C. mclachlani provides the basis for a reinterpretation of phyllolepid anatomy and function. Cowralepis mclachlani possesses paired basibranchials allowing the reinterpretation of the visceral skeleton in other placoderms. Mandible depression in C. mclachlani follows an osteichthyan pattern and the ventral visceral skeleton acts as a functional unit. Evidence for hypobranchial musculature demonstrates the neural crest origin of the basibranchials and that Cowralepis was a suction feeder. Finally, the position of the visceral skeleton relative to the neurocranium in placoderms parallels the condition in selachians and osteichthyans, but differs in the elongation of the occiput. The cucullaris fossa of placoderms (interpreted as a site of muscle attachment) is shown to represent, in part, the parabrancbial chamber. J. Morphol. 270:775-804, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

The aim was to systematically examine palliative care research from Sweden between 2007 and 2012, with special attention to methods, designs and research foci. MethodsA literature review was undertaken. The databases Academic search elite, Age line, Ahmed, Cinahl, PsychInfo, PubMed, Scopus, Soc abstracts, Web of science and Libris were reviewed for Swedish palliative care research studies published from 2007 to 2012, applying the search criteria palliative care OR palliative medicine OR end-of-life care OR terminal care OR hospice care OR dying OR death'. ResultsA total of 263 papers met the inclusion criteria, indicating an increased volume of research compared to the 133 articles identified in the previous review. Common study foci were symptom assessment and management, experiences of illness and care planning. Targeting non-cancer-specific populations and utilisation of population-based register studies were identified as new features. There was continued domination of cross-sectional, qualitative and mono-disciplinary studies, not including ethnic minority groups, nonverbally communicable people or children <18years of age. ConclusionsThe trend is that Swedish palliative care research has expanded in volume from 2007 to 2012 compared to during the 1970s to 2006, with increasing participation of non-cancer-specific populations. A domination of qualitative approaches and small, cross-sectional studies with few interventions is still characteristic.

However, the direction and extent of this effect reported by different authors is inconsistent. Objective: The objective was to provide a synthesis of existing data that comprehensively and quantitatively evaluates how the soil chemical properties and incubation conditions interact with additional external organic C to affect the native SOC decomposition. Data Source: A meta-analysis was conducted on previously published empirical studies that examined the effect of the addition of external organic carbon on the native SOC decomposition through isotopic techniques. Results and Conclusions: The addition of external organic C, when averaged across all studies, enhanced the native SOC decomposition by 26.5%. The soil with higher SOC content and fine texture showed significantly higher priming effects, whereas the soil with higher total nitrogen content showed an opposite trend. The soils with higher C:N ratios had significantly stronger priming effects than those with low C: N ratios. The decomposition of native SOC was significantly enhanced more at early stage of incubation (<15d) than at the later stages (>15d). In addition, the incubation temperature and the addition rate of organic matter significantly influenced the native SOC decomposition in response to the addition of external organic C.",meta-analysis
55,excluded,Responses of litter decomposition and nutrient release to N addition: A meta-analysis of terrestrial ecosystems,"As atmospheric nitrogen (N) concentrations increase, it can wreak havoc on the entire planet, as well as the fragile ecosystems, once it exceeds the demand of ecosystems. Chronically elevated N deposition affects litter decomposition, which is a crucial process that controls nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and primary productivity. Nevertheless, the responses of litter decomposition and nutrient release to N addition remain elusive. Here we conduct a meta-analysis using 3434 paired observations from 55 publications to evaluate these responses. We found that although litter decomposition rate did not change significantly under N addition when averaged across all studies, it decreased with N application rate and experimental duration, showing that it was stimulated at low levels but suppressed at high levels of N application and duration. Phosphorus released more slowly under N enrichment, and this response became greater with longer duration. Moreover, the decomposition of lignin was depressed under N addition, and this effect was more pronounced with the increase of N application rate and experimental duration. Importantly, in terms of different ecosystems, the decomposition of litter was significantly inhibited by N addition in plantations, but was promoted in secondary forests, and there were no significant changes in primary forests, grasslands and wetlands. The responses of litter mass loss, along with the release of nutrients to N fertilization, changed with mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation of the study sites. Our results provided a synthetic understanding of the effects of N addition on the decomposition of litter and nutrient release under climate change scenarios.",Litter decomposition; Meta-analysis; Nitrogen deposition; Nutrient release; Plantation; Secondary forest
56,excluded,Changes in soil carbon flux and carbon stock over a rotation of poplar plantations in northwest china,"Forest soil is a major component of terrestrial ecosystems for carbon sequestration and plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. Soil carbon flux and soil carbon pools were investigated in a poplar plantation chronosequence over a rotation in northwest China. Based on continuous field observation in 2007, the results showed that mean soil CO(2) efflux rate was 5.54, 4.81, and 3.93 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) for stands of 2-, 8-, and 15-year-old, respectively, during the growing season. Significant differences in soil respiration of three age classes were mainly because soil temperature, carbon allocation, and fine root growth changed greatly with stand age. Multiple regression analysis suggested that soil temperature and fine root biomass in the upper layer could explain 78-85% of the variation in soil respiration. Mineral soil C stock at 0-40 cm depth was 55.77, 55.09, and 58.14 t ha(-1) in the 2-, 8-, and 15-year-old stands, respectively. The average rate of soil C sequestration was 0.13 t ha(-1) year(-1) following afforestation on former crop lands. Although the plantations had similar management practices and soil types since their establishment, many biotic and abiotic factors such as root biomass and turnover rate, soil condition of the plantations had undergone marked changes at different development stages, which could result in the remarkable differences in soil carbon flux and storage over a rotation. Our results highlight the importance of the development stage within a rotation of poplar plantation in assessment of soil carbon budget.",
57,excluded,Biochar stability in soil: meta-analysis of decomposition and priming effects,"The stability and decomposition of biochar are fundamental to understand its persistence in soil, its contribution to carbon (C) sequestration, and thus its role in the global C cycle. Our current knowledge about the degradability of biochar, however, is limited. Using 128 observations of biochar-derived CO2 from 24 studies with stable (C-13) and radioactive (C-14) carbon isotopes, we meta-analyzed the biochar decomposition in soil and estimated its mean residence time (MRT). The decomposed amount of biochar increased logarithmically with experimental duration, and the decomposition rate decreased with time. The biochar decomposition rate varied significantly with experimental duration, feedstock, pyrolysis temperature, and soil clay content. The MRTs of labile and recalcitrant biochar C pools were estimated to be about 108days and 556years with pool sizes of 3% and 97%, respectively. These results show that only a small part of biochar is bioavailable and that the remaining 97% contribute directly to long-term C sequestration in soil. The second database (116 observations from 21 studies) was used to evaluate the priming effects after biochar addition. Biochar slightly retarded the mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM; overall mean: -3.8%, 95% CI=-8.1-0.8%) compared to the soil without biochar addition. Significant negative priming was common for studies with a duration shorter than half a year (-8.6%), crop-derived biochar (-20.3%), fast pyrolysis (-18.9%), the lowest pyrolysis temperature (-18.5%), and small application amounts (-11.9%). In contrast, biochar addition to sandy soils strongly stimulated SOM mineralization by 20.8%. This indicates that biochar stimulates microbial activities especially in soils with low fertility. Furthermore, abiotic and biotic processes, as well as the characteristics of biochar and soils, affecting biochar decomposition are discussed. We conclude that biochar can persist in soils on a centennial scale and that it has a positive effect on SOM dynamics and thus on C sequestration.",black carbon; C sequestration; climate change; priming effect; pyrogenic organic matter; soil respiration

However, recent meta-analysis documented controversial effects on soil plant interactions and on crop yields response. The data presented in this paper are the results of a field experiment on a processing tomato crop aiming to enhance the knowledge on the real applicability of biochar at farm scale in a high fertility alkaline soil. The effects of two biochar types on soil properties and on quantitative and qualitative parameters of processing tomato were evaluated. Biochar application significantly increased the soil carbon content, the soil cation exchange capacity and the availability of NH4(+), P and K. Moreover, it stimulated plant growth and N, P and base cation contents at harvest, reducing the leaf water potential in the warmer period. These results demonstrate that also intensive cultivations in fertile soil can benefit from biochar amendment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

There is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis in children. We conducted a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis of primary pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in children and adolescents (0-21 years) with cancer. The primary outcomes were objectively proven TE and major bleeding. The network meta-analysis included comparisons of multiple alternatives simultaneously: antithrombin (AT) replacement, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and standard of care (SOC) defined as no thromboprophylaxis or low-dose heparin for catheter patency. Six articles describing 1,318 patients were included (mean age: 6.7 years, 56.7% male). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was the underlying diagnosis in 97.5% of patients. All studies were considered at moderate or high risk of bias. LMWH was the only agent associated with lower odds of TE compared with SOC (odds ratio [OR]: 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.06-0.81). No statistically significant difference was detected between other thromboprophylaxis modalities and SOC. Tau (2) and I (2) suggested a high degree of heterogeneity. No statistically significant differences in the odds of major bleeding were found between AT replacement, LMWH, VKA, and SOC. Current evidence suggests that low-dose LMWH is effective and safe to prevent TE in children with cancer but is insufficient to conclude if AT replacement or VKA are effective thromboprophylaxis options.

This study aimed to analyse the relation between close social networks and adolescents' drinking habits and the extent to which close social networks may explain differences in binge drinking among social groups. Data from the Stockholm Survey 2012' were analysed. The Stockholm Survey was a census survey administered to students in academic years 9 and 11, with a response rate of 76%. Ordered logit models were used to estimate relations between the frequency of binge drinking and the independent variables. Parental educational level is associated with adolescent binge drinking, as students with more highly educated parents are more frequent binge drinkers. Parents' willingness to offer their teenagers alcohol and peers' drinking habits are also associated with adolescent binge drinking, with a more permissive parental attitude and a prevalence of drinking among peers increasing the risk. Both parents' willingness to provide alcohol and peers' drinking habits may statistically explain a large portion of the observed differences in adolescent drinking by parental education. Close social networks are an important factor influencing adolescent binge drinking, and they may explain a large portion of the differences between social groups.

61,included,Managing soil carbon for climate change mitigation and adaptation in Mediterranean cropping systems: A meta-analysis,"Mediterranean croplands are seasonally dry agroecosystems with low soil organic carbon (SOC) content and high risk of land degradation and desertification. The increase in SOC is of special interest in these systems, as it can help to build resilience for climate change adaptation while contributing to mitigate global warming through the sequestration of atmospheric carbon (C). We compared SOC change and C sequestration under a number of recommended management practices (RMPs) with neighboring conventional plots under Mediterranean climate (174 data sets from 79 references). The highest response in C sequestration was achieved by those practices applying largest amounts of C inputs (land treatment and organic amendments). Conservation tillage practices (no-tillage and reduced tillage) induced lower effect sizes but significantly promoted C sequestration, whereas no effect and negative net sequestration rates were observed for slurry applications and unfertilized treatments, respectively. Practices combining external organic amendments with cover crops or conservation tillage (combined management practices and organic management) showed very good performance in C sequestration. We studied separately the changes in SOC under organic management, with 80 data sets from 30 references. The results also suggest that the degree of intensification in C input rate is the main driver behind the relative C accumulation in organic treatments. Thus, highest net C sequestration rates were observed in most eco-intensive groups, such as ""irrigated"", ""horticulture"" and controlled experiments (""plot scale""). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

62,excluded,Kidney disease and increased mortality risk in type 2 diabetes,"Type 2 diabetes associates with increased risk of mortality, but how kidney disease contributes to this mortality risk among individuals with type 2 diabetes is not completely understood. Here, we examined 10-year cumulative mortality by diabetes and kidney disease status for 15,046 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) by linking baseline data from NHANES III with the National Death Index. Kidney disease, defined as urinary albumin/creatinine ratio mg/g and/or estimated GFR <= 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), was present in 9.4% and 42.3% of individuals without and with type 2 diabetes, respectively. Among people without diabetes or kidney disease (reference group), 10-year cumulative all-cause mortality was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [95% Cl], 7.0%-8.3%), standardized to population age, sex, and race. Among individuals with diabetes but without kidney disease, standardized mortality was 11.5% (95% Cl, 7.9%-15.2%), representing an absolute risk difference with the reference group of 3.9% (95% Cl, 0.1%-7.7%), adjusted for demographics, and 3.4% (95% Cl, 0.3% to 7.0%) when further adjusted for smoking, BP, and cholesterol. Among individuals with both diabetes and kidney disease, standardized mortality was 31.1% (95% Cl, 24.7%-37.5%), representing an absolute risk difference with the reference group of 23.4% (95% Cl, 17.0%-29.9%), adjusted for demographics, and 23.4% (95% Cl, 17.2%-29.6%) when further adjusted. We observed similar patterns for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality. In conclusion, those with kidney disease predominantly account for the increased mortality observed in type 2 diabetes. J Am Soc Nephrol 24: 302-308, 2013. doi: 10.1681/ASN.2012070718",
63,excluded,Cost-effectiveness analysis of bezlotoxumab added to standard of care versus standard of care alone for the prevention of recurrent clostridium difficile infection in high-risk patients in spain,"IntroductionClostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the major cause of infectious nosocomial diarrhoea and is associated with considerable morbidity, mortality and economic impact. Bezlotoxumab administered in combination with standard of care (SoC) antibiotic therapy prevents recurrent CDI. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of bezlotoxumab added to SoC, compared to SoC alone, to prevent the recurrence of CDI in high-risk patients from the Spanish National Health System perspective.MethodsA Markov model was used to simulate the natural history of CDI over a lifetime horizon in five populations of patients at high risk of CDI recurrence according to MODIFY trials: (1)65years old; (2) severe CDI; (3) immunocompromised; (4)1 CDI episode in the previous 6months; and (5)65years old and with1 CDI episode in the previous 6months. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was calculated. Deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed.ResultsIn all patient populations (from 1 to 5), bezlotoxumab added to SoC reduced CDI recurrence compared to SoC alone by 26.4, 19.5, 21.2, 26.6 and 39.7%, respectively. The resulting ICERs for the respective subgroups were Euro12,724, Euro17,495, Euro9545, Euro7386, and Euro4378. The model parameters with highest impact on the ICER were recurrence rate (first), mortality, and utility values. The probability that bezlotoxumab was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of Euro21,000/QALY was 85.5%, 54.1%, 86.0%, 94.5%, 99.6%, respectively.ConclusionThe results suggest that bezlotoxumab added to SoC compared to SoC alone is a cost-effective treatment to prevent the recurrence of CDI in high-risk patients. The influence of changes in model parameters on DSA results was higher in patients 65years old, with severe CDI and immunocompromised. Additionally, PSA estimated that the probability of cost-effectiveness exceeded 85% in most subgroups.FundingMerck Sharp & Dohme Corp.",Bezlotoxumab; Clostridium difficile infection; Cost-effectiveness
64,excluded,Trastuzumab biosimilar in metastatic breast cancer: evaluating equivalence with originator using network meta-analysis,"Objective: The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have recently approved four different trastuzumab biosimilars, marketed by different pharmaceutical companies. Biosimilars, unlike their originators, are typically supported by less clinical data about safety and efficacy. The objective of our analysis was to demonstrate that one of the approved trastuzumab biosimilars (MYL-1401O) is as effective as its originator in terms of hazard ratio (FIR) of progression-free survival (PFS). Materials and methods: We carried out a network meta-analysis to compare the HR values for biosimilar, originator, and standard of care (SOC). Our analysis included a preliminary pairwise meta-analysis. The pooled HR for all pairwise comparisons was the output of the analysis (fixed-effect inverse variance method), along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The indirect comparison between biosimilar and SOC was performed using a network meta-analysis software. Results: We estimated an FIR of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.52 - 0.66) for the comparison between PFS values of originator and SOC, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.74 - 1.28) for biosimilar vs. originator, and 0.61 (95% CI: 0.44 - 0.83) for biosimilar vs. SOC. Our network meta-analysis increased the overall number of evaluated patients from 458 to 1,955. Conclusion: According to the network meta-analysis, MYL-1401O biosimilar is as effective as its originator in terms of HR of PFS.",metastatic breast cancer; trastuzumab; biosimilar; progression-free survival; network meta-analysis
65,excluded,Wood ash applications to temperate forest ecosystems - potential benefits and drawbacks,"The objectives of the present work were (a) to quantify the effects of wood ash on forest ecosystems through a meta-analysis approach associated with a detailed review of the literature (mainly composed of work carried out in Nordic countries) and (b) to extrapolate the effects on forest growth to other contexts (i.e. warm temperate countries) by identifying the cases for which wood ash applications can be beneficial to forest production. Three databases were built regarding the effects of wood ash on soil (151 observations; 33 experimental field trials), on nutrient concentrations of tree foliage (68 observations; 28 trials) and on annual stem biomass growth rate (70 observations; 27 trials). We obtained information on the wide variability of ash properties due to differences in burnt compounds, combustion processes and ash conditioning. Two important properties of wood ash are its high pH value and neutralizing capacity. These properties result in biochemical modifications of forest soils limed with ash. In the short term, soil solution composition was dramatically modified. Intense peaks of the K, Na or SO4 concentrations were observed, resulting from the dissolution of salts contained in ash. At the same time, Ca and Mg concentrations increased as the carbonate pool of wood ash started to dissolve. The consequence of this dissolution process was an increase in the pH in all the soil phases. These modifications increased the activity of the soil microflora and some isolated peaks in the mineralization of soil organic matter may be observed in mineral soils. In the longer term, that is to say after the first year following ash application, only the effect on the acidity status of the soil remained significant. The effects of ash addition on forest ecosystems usually increased with the dose and were more pronounced with loose ash compared to aggregated ash. The addition of wood ash into forest ecosystems increased the foliar Ca status of trees. Some modifications of other nutrients, like P or K, were also observed but only for a few years after treatment. For most stands growing on mineral soils of Nordic countries, this treatment did not result in an increase in tree growth, probably because of the absence of N in the ash. For stands growing on organic soils of the same area, this input, associated with a long-lasting increase of soil organic matter mineralization, was sufficient to improve tree growth significantly (median=+59% compared to the control). For soils located in warm temperate regions, similar responses are expected for organic soils. For mineral soils, the wood ash application is expected to be suitable for stands showing deficiencies in K, Ca or Mg. Ash may contain high amounts of toxic heavy metals such as Cd. The bioavailability of most of these elements appeared to be very low in a forest context. No contamination of food chains has been observed, except possibly via some species of fungi, and heavy metals remain in the forest litter or in the topsoil. Based on all the reviewed results, several guidelines for wood ash application into forest ecosystems are proposed. Wood ash application should be restricted to acidic soils. Applications should consist of low doses of a stabilized ash form. Wood ash should be applied to adult stands rather than onto seedlings.",
66,excluded,Long-term effects of mineral fertilizers on soil microorganisms - a review,"Increasing nutrient inputs into terrestrial ecosystems affect not only plant communities but also associated soil microbial communities. Studies carried out in predominantly unmanaged ecosystems have found that increasing nitrogen (N) inputs generally decrease soil microbial biomass; less is known about long-term impacts in managed systems such as agroecosystems. The objective of this paper was to analyze the responses of soil microorganisms to mineral fertilizer using data from long-term fertilization trials in cropping systems. A meta-analysis based on 107 datasets from 64 long-term trials from around the world revealed that mineral fertilizer application led to a 15.1% increase in the microbial biomass (C-mic) above levels in unfertilized control treatments. Mineral fertilization also increased soil organic carbon (C-org) content and our results suggest that C-org is a major factor contributing to the overall increase in Cmic with mineral fertilization. The magnitude of the effect of fertilization on C-mic was pH dependent. While fertilization tended to reduce C-mic in soils with a pH below 5 in the fertilized treatment, it had a significantly positive effect at higher soil pH values. Duration of the trial also affected the response of C-mic to fertilization, with increases in C-mic most pronounced in studies with a duration of at least 20 years. The input of N per se does not seem to negatively affect C-mic in cropping systems. The application of urea and ammonia fertilizers, however, can temporarily increase pH, osmotic potential and ammonia concentrations to levels inhibitory to microbial communities. Even though impacts of fertilizers are spatially limited, they may strongly affect soil microbial biomass and community composition in the short term. Long-term repeated mineral N applications may alter microbial community composition even when pH changes are small. How specific microbial groups respond to repeated applications of mineral fertilizers, however, varies considerably and seems to depend on environmental and crop management related factors.

67,excluded,Effect of land management practices on the concentration of dissolved organic matter in soil: A meta-analysis,"Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) are important components of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil. A change in the concentration of soil DOM leads to changes in the soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools and the emergence of potential pollution. Many studies have reported that the concentrations of soil DOM could be significantly influenced by land management practices. However, the results obtained from these studies are inconsistent, and the effects of environmental factors on the responses of DOM concentrations to such management practices remain unclear. The aims of this study were to: (1) synthesize the available datasets and elucidate the general patterns of changes in soil DOM concentrations in response to different land management practices; and (2) probe how the responses of DOM concentrations to management practices were affected by environmental factors (e.g., altitude, climate, and soil properties). Data from 942 observations in 184 publications were collected, integrated, and statistically analyzed. The meta-analysis result shows that overall, N fertilization, liming, organic amendment addition, and vegetation cover significantly increased the concentrations of soil DOM, whereas tillage decreased DOC concentrations. The magnitude of all positive and negative effects was driven by implemented management practices. Generally, a threshold range might exist for the application rate and duration of the management measures that could cause significant changes in DOM concentrations. In addition, DOC concentrations were more responsive to N fertilization and liming than were DON concentrations, indicating that the changes in the two variables were not correlated in each management practice. The results also indicate that the responses of DOM concentrations to management practices could be regulated by the altitude, climate (e.g., mean annual temperature and precipitation), and soil property factors (e.g., total C, total N, C:N ratio, clay content, and initial soil pH). In conclusion, our study suggests that in order to maintain proper soil DOM concentrations in an ecosystem, not only the type and implementation of management practices but also the local environmental factors should be considered when proposing a land management plan.",DOC; DON; Land management practices; Environmental factors; Meta-analysis
68,excluded,"Osteoclast inhibitors to prevent bone metastases in men with high-risk, non-metastatic prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background In advanced prostate cancer, osteoclast inhibitors prevent and palliate skeletal related events associated with bone metastases. However, it is uncertain whether they play a disease- modifying role earlier in the course of the disease. Methods Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and ASCO conference proceedings were searched for randomized controlled trials that compared osteoclast inhibitors with placebo and/or standard of care (SOC) in patients with high-risk, non-metastatic prostate cancer. The primary outcome measure was incidence of new bone metastases; secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), prostate cancer specific survival, mortality unrelated to prostate cancer, toxicity and health related quality of life outcomes. Results are presented as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Six randomized controlled trials (5947 participants) were included, five evaluating bisphosphonates and one denosumab. Overall, there was no difference in incidence of bone metastases between participants treated with osteoclast inhibitors versus placebo/SOC (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.84-1.41, p = 0.51) however significant heterogeneity was observed between studies. The denosumab trial was the largest and only positive trial amongst the included studies (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.95, p = 0.007). No significant difference was observed in OS (RR 0.99 95% CI 0.89-1.10, p = 0.84) nor prostate cancer specific survival (RR 1.12 95% CI 0.93-1.36, p = 0.24). Most studies reported increased rates of osteonecrosis of the jaw (5% or less) and hypocalcemia (2% or less) with osteoclast inhibitors. Conclusions While there is limited evidence that bisphosphonates alter the natural history of high-risk, non-metastatic prostate cancer, denosumab delays onset of bone metastases in this patient population. Neither class of osteoclast inhibitor demonstrated an impact on survival outcomes. Future trials with better defined patient selection and a robust definition for high risk disease is critical.",
69,excluded,Climate warming and biomass accumulation of terrestrial plants: a meta-analysis,"P>Growth of terrestrial plant species and functional types (PFTs) in response to climate warming determines future dynamics of terrestrial vegetation. Here, a meta-analysis was conducted with data collected from 127 publications to reveal general patterns of biomass responses of terrestrial plants to warming. Warming significantly increased biomass by 12.3% (with a 95% confidence interval of 8.4-16.3%) across all the terrestrial plants included. However, biomass responses were dependent upon PFTs, with significantly greater stimulation of woody (+26.7%) than herbaceous species (+5.2%). Warming effects on biomass showed quadratic relationships with both latitude and mean annual temperature, but did not change with mean annual precipitation or experimental duration. In addition, the other treatments, including CO(2) enrichment, nitrogen addition, drought and water addition, did not alter warming responses of plant biomass. Dependence of the terrestrial plant biomass responses to warming upon PFTs, geographic and climatic factors as well as warming magnitudes will have consequent influences on community composition and structure, vegetation dynamics, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in a warmer world. Our findings of functional type-specific responses of terrestrial plants are critical for improving predictions of climate-terrestrial carbon feedbacks.",
70,excluded,Soil and aggregate-associated carbon in a young loblolly pine plantation: influence of bioenergy intercropping,"In order to assess the carbon (C) footprint of forest-based bioenergy systems, it is necessary to quantify soil C storage. This study addressed effects of intercropping loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) with switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) for wood and bioenergy production on soil C storage in coastal North Carolina, USA. Spaces between rows of bedded pine were intercropped with switchgrass or contained native vegetative regrowth after site preparation. Two years after switchgrass establishment, soils were collected from beds and interbeds of each treatment, and C concentration and delta C-13 were measured in bulk soils and aggregate fractions. Soil C concentration, soil C density (Mg ha(-1)), and aggregate-associated C were lower in pine beds adjacent to switchgrass compared with pines adjacent to native regrowth. In the greater than 2,000-mu m aggregate size class, 11% of C was derived from new pine inputs in beds of the pine-switchgrass treatment compared to the pine-native treatment. These results indicate that increased belowground C flow in pine beds adjacent to switchgrass may be driving breakdown soil C. In the pine-switchgrass intercropping treatment, a greater percentage of aggregates (by weight and C content) was found in the 2,000- to 250-mu m size class of both beds and interbeds, suggesting that this aggregate size class is sensitive to management. This study provides a baseline analysis of C storage under different management scenarios in pine forests and for investigating long-term (10+ years) impacts. Although presence of switchgrass reduced soil C over the short term, bioenergy intercropping may still be pragmatic from an economical and land-use diversification view point.",Pinus taeda; Panicum virgatum; switchgrass; isotope; soil organic matter
71,included,Organic amendments increase crop yields by improving microbe-mediated soil functioning of agroecosystems: A meta-analysis,"Although numerous studies suggest that organic amendments are better at maintaining soil fertility and crop production than mineral-only fertilization, it is unclear if this occurs in different agricultural systems on a global scale. Here we report a comprehensive meta-analysis of 690 independent experiments comparing the performance of organic amendments and mineral-only fertilization on crop yields, the soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents, soil nutrient dynamics and biological properties. Our analysis shows that organic amendments increased crop yields on average of 27% than mineral-only fertilization. Farmyard manure (FYM) had the highest effect (49% increase) and this was especially clear in wheat croplands (40% increase). Organic amendment increased the amount of SOC (38%), TN (20%), microbial biomass carbon (MBC; 51%) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN; 24%) than mineral-only fertilization. Organic amendments also increased the soil microbiome enzyme activity in terms of soil hydrolytic C acquisition (C-acq; 39%), N acquisition (N-acq; 22%), P acquisition (P-acq; 48%) and oxidative decomposition (OX; 58%). Increased nutrient acquisition and oxidative decomposition could explain the positive effects of organic amendment on crop yields. These observed patterns were consistent for most organic amendments and cropping systems in diverse regions of the world. In summary, our analysis suggests that organic amendments can improve microbe-mediated soil ecosystem functioning, long-term soil fertility and crop productivity, relative to mineral fertilization, on a global scale.",Organic amendment; Crop yields; Soil extracellular enzymes; Microbial biomass pools; Meta-analysis
72,included,A global meta-analysis of soil organic carbon response to corn stover removal,"Corn (Zea mays L.) stover is a global resource used for livestock, fuel, and bioenergy feedstock, but excessive stover removal can decrease soil organic C (SOC) stocks and deteriorate soil health. Many site-specific stover removal experiments report accrual rates and SOC stock effects, but a quantitative, global synthesis is needed to provide a scientific base for long-term energy policy decisions. We used 409 data points from 74 stover harvest experiments conducted around the world for a metaanalysis and meta-regression to quantify removal rate, tillage, soil texture, and soil sampling depth effects on SOC. Changes were quantified by: (a) comparing final SOC stock differences after at least 3 years with and without stover removal and (b) calculating SOC accrual rates for both treatments. Stover removal generally reduced final SOC stocks by 8% in the upper 0-15 or 0-30 cm, compared to stover retained, irrespective of soil properties and tillage practices. A more sensitive meta-regression analysis showed that retention increased SOC stocks within the 30-150 cm depth by another 5%. Compared to baseline values, stover retention increased average SOC stocks temporally at a rate of 0.41 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) (statistically significant at p < 0.01 when averaged across all soil layers). Although SOC sequestration rates were lower with stover removal, with moderate (< 50%) removal they can be positive, thus emphasizing the importance of site-specific management. Our results also showed that tillage effects on SOC stocks were inconsistent due to the high variability in practices used among the experimental sites. Finally, we conclude that research and technological efforts should continue to be given high priority because of the importance in providing science-based policy recommendations for long-term global carbon management.",carbon sequestration; corn; meta-analysis; soil organic carbon; stover removal; tillage
73,excluded,How do selected crop rotations affect soil organic carbon in boreo-temperate systems? A systematic review protocol,"Background: Soils are important global carbon pools that are under threat from intensive land use through a variety of agricultural practices. Sustainable management of agricultural soils may have the potential to mitigate climate change through increased carbon sequestration and increase their fertility. Among management practices to increase carbon sequestration, crop rotation designs have often been tested on yield effects in long-term agricultural experiments. However, in these studies, soil organic carbon (SOC) was monitored but not always the key objective. Thus, here we provide a method for a systematic review to test the effects of common crop rotations on SOC sequestration to provide evidence on the most sustainable management regimes that can promote SOC storage. Methods: This systematic review incorporates studies concerning selected crop rotations (rotations-vs-monocultures, legumes-vs-no legumes, and perennials-vs-annuals) collated in a recently completed systematic map on the effect of agricultural management on SOC, restricted to boreo-temperate systems (i.e., the warm temperate climate zone). Some 208 studies relevant for this systematic review were identified in the systematic map. An update of the original search (September 2013) will be undertaken to identify newly published academic and grey literature. Studies will be critically appraised for their internal and external validity, followed by full data extraction (meta-data describing study settings and quantitative study results). Where possible, studies will be included in meta-analyses examining the effects of the different rotational practices.

74,excluded,Comparison with global soil radiocarbon observations indicates needed carbon cycle improvements in the e3sm land model,"We evaluated global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and turnover time predictions from a global land model (ELMv1-ECA) integrated in an Earth System Model (E3SM) by comparing them with observed soil bulk and Delta C-14 values around the world. We analyzed observed and simulated SOC stocks and Delta C-14 values using machine learning methods at the Earth System Model grid cell scale (similar to 200km). In grid cells with sufficient observations, the model provided reasonable estimates of soil carbon stocks across soil depth and Delta C-14 values near the surface but underestimated Delta C-14 at depth. Among many explanatory variables, soil albedo index, soil order, plant function type, air temperature, and SOC content were major factors affecting predicted SOC Delta C-14 values. The influences of soil albedo index, soil order, and air temperature were primarily important in the shallow subsurface (<= 30cm). We also performed sensitivity studies using different vertical root distributions and decomposition turnover times and compared to observed SOC stock and Delta C-14 profiles. The analyses support the role of vegetation in affecting soil carbon turnover, particularly in deep soil, possibly through supplying fresh carbon and degrading physical-chemical protection of SOC via root activities. Allowing for grid cell-specific rooting and decomposition rates substantially reduced discrepancies between observed and predicted Delta C-14 values and SOC content. Our results highlight the need for more explicit representation of roots, microbes, and soil physical protection in land models. Plain Language Summary Quantifying feedbacks between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate is important for understanding climate change. Among many factors that control terrestrial carbon cycle responses to climate, soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are particularly important, although highly uncertain. In addition to SOC stocks, radiocarbon is an important observational constraint for land model predictions. We evaluated, against worldwide observations of SOC stocks and radiocarbon, predictions from a new land model used for climate change analyses. We analyzed differences between model predictions and observations using a machine learning method at a large grid cell scale (similar to 200km). Among many explanatory variables, soil albedo index, soil order, plant function type, air temperature, and SOC densities were major factors affecting predicted SOC radiocarbon values. The influences of soil albedo index, soil order, and air temperature were primarily important for topsoil. Our sensitivity analysis highlights the role of plant root activity in affecting soil carbon turnover, particularly in deep soil, possibly through supplying fresh carbon and degrading physical-chemical protection of SOC.

76,excluded,Soil carbon sequestration and associated economic costs for farming systems of the indo-gangetic plain: a meta-analysis,"Soil organic carbon sequestration rates over 20 years based on the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) methodology were combined with local economic data to determine the potential for soil C sequestration in wheat-based production systems on the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). The C sequestration potential of rice-wheat systems of India on conversion to no-tillage is estimated to be 44.1 Mt C over 20 years. Implementing no-tillage practices in maize-wheat and cotton-wheat production systems would yield an additional 6.6 Mt C. This offset is equivalent to 9.6% of India's annual greenhouse gas emissions (519 Mt C) from all sectors (excluding land use change and forestry), or less than one percent per annum. The economic analysis was summarized as carbon supply curves expressing the total additional C accumulated over 20 year for a price per tonne of carbon sequestered ranging from zero to USD 200. At a carbon price of USD 25 Mg C-1, 3 Mt C (7% of the soil C sequestration potential) could be sequestered over 20 years through the implementation of no-till cropping practices in rice-wheat systems of the Indian States of the IGP, increasing to 7.3 Mt C (17% of the soil C sequestration potential) at USD 50 Mg C-1. Maximum levels of sequestration could be attained with carbon prices approaching USD 200 Mg C-1 for the States of Bihar and Punjab. At this carbon price, a total of 34.7 Mt C (79% of the estimated C sequestration potential) could be sequestered over 20 years across the rice-wheat region of India, with Uttar Pradesh contributing 13.9 Mt C.

Nevertheless, only current smokers in the hospital-based group had increased susceptibility of AML (OR=1.45, 95%CI=1.19-1.76; p=0.198). The risks of AML in ever-smokers (OR=1.04, 95%CI= 0.81-1.35; p=0.054) of the hospital-based group did not remarkably changed. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, we confirmed the association between cigarette smoking and onset risk of AML, especially in the Caucasian population. High-quality, large-scale researches are required to be conducted in multi-center hospitals for verification.",Smoking; Susceptibility; AML; Meta-analysis
78,excluded,Affective organizational commitment among nursing home employees: a longitudinal study on the influence of a health-promoting work environment,"Aim To investigate whether affective organizational commitment (AOC) among nursing home employees is enhanced by a health-promoting work environment, conceptualized as high levels of job resources, work-related sense of coherence (work-SOC) and low levels of job demands. Design This study used a longitudinal design. Survey data were collected with a 1-year interval between 2015/2016-2016/2017 among nursing home employees in Norway. Methods Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the longitudinal data (N = 166) and cross-sectional data from the first time point (N = 558). Results The results supported that work-SOC was strongly and positively related to AOC. Job resources and job demands were positively and negatively related, respectively, to work-SOC but were not related to future AOC. The indirect effects of autonomy and supervisor support on AOC, via work-SOC, were significant. The indirect effects regarding social community at work, emotional demands and role conflict were unclear.",affective organizational commitment; eldercare; emotional demands; health care; job demands; job resources; nursing; nursing homes; work-related sense of coherence
79,excluded,Distinct responses of soil respiration to experimental litter manipulation in temperate woodland and tropical forest,"Global change is affecting primary productivity in forests worldwide, and this, in turn, will alter long-term carbon (C) sequestration in wooded ecosystems. On one hand, increased primary productivity, for example, in response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), can result in greater inputs of organic matter to the soil, which could increase C sequestration belowground. On other hand, many of the interactions between plants and microorganisms that determine soil C dynamics are poorly characterized, and additional inputs of plant material, such as leaf litter, can result in the mineralization of soil organic matter, and the release of soil C as CO2 during so-called priming effects. Until now, very few studies made direct comparison of changes in soil C dynamics in response to altered plant inputs in different wooded ecosystems. We addressed this with a cross-continental study with litter removal and addition treatments in a temperate woodland (Wytham Woods) and lowland tropical forest (Gigante forest) to compare the consequences of increased litterfall on soil respiration in two distinct wooded ecosystems. Mean soil respiration was almost twice as high at Gigante (5.0molCO(2)m(-2)s(-1)) than at Wytham (2.7molCO(2)m(-2)s(-1)) but surprisingly, litter manipulation treatments had a greater and more immediate effect on soil respiration at Wytham. We measured a 30% increase in soil respiration in response to litter addition treatments at Wytham, compared to a 10% increase at Gigante. Importantly, despite higher soil respiration rates at Gigante, priming effects were stronger and more consistent at Wytham. Our results suggest that in situ priming effects in wooded ecosystems track seasonality in litterfall and soil respiration but the amount of soil C released by priming is not proportional to rates of soil respiration. Instead, priming effects may be promoted by larger inputs of organic matter combined with slower turnover rates.",fine root biomass; forest ecosystems; litter manipulation; microbial biomass; priming effects; soil carbon dynamics
80,excluded,Efficacy of plasma exchange and immunoadsorption in systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic review,"Extracorporeal treatments have been used since the 1970s in the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A randomised controlled trial comparing the efficacy of standard of care (SOC) combined with plasma exchange against SOC alone in patients with lupus nephritis revealed no difference in terms of renal outcome. Subsequently, initial expectations have been dampened and further experience with plasma exchange is mainly limited to observational studies and single case reports. Beneficial effects have been reported in patients with refractory disease course or in pregnancy with prior complications due to SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome. A more specific form of extracorporeal treatment, immunoadsorption (IAS), has emerged as a valuable option in the treatment of SLE. In line with the plasma exchange experience, IAS seems to have beneficial effects in patients with refractory disease, contraindications to standard immunosuppression or during pregnancy. The mechanism IAS relates to autoantibody removal but for plasma exchange removal of activated complement components, coagulation factors, cytokines and microparticles may also be relevant. Both treatment forms have good safety profiles although reactions to blood product replacement in plasma exchange and procedure related complications such as bleeding or catheter-related infections have occurred. There is a need to more clearly define the clinical utility of plasma exchange and IAS in refractory lupus and APS subgroups. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

81,excluded,Water and nitrogen use efficiencies in citrus production: a meta-analysis,"Water and nitrogen (N) are two key limiting factors for citrus production. Reported effects of water and N inputs on citrus yield, water use efficiency (WUE) and N use efficiency (NUE) vary greatly, mainly due to differences in cultivars, tree age, climate, soil types, and water and N input levels. So far, no systematic analysis has been performed, and as a result, the interactive effects of water and N inputs on yield, WUE and NUE of citrus orchards are unknown. Also, gaps between attainable and actual yields, WUE and NUE have not been established yet. Here, we report on a global meta-analysis of yields, WUE and NUE of citrus production systems, using 1009 observations from 55 studies, conducted in 11 countries. Median citrus yields ranged from 30 to 60 t ha(-1), which were in between average global yields (range 10-30 t ha(-1)) and attainable yields (range 60-90 t ha(-1)). Median WUE ranged from 2.5 to 5 kg m(-3) and median NUE from 150 to 350 kg kg(-1). Citrus yields were related to water and N inputs and tree age. Relationships between water and N inputs and yield, WUE and NUE were also analysed for sub-datasets and quantiles, to examine the relationships near the extremes. There were statistical significant interactions between water and N inputs in yield and NUE, but not in WUE. This indicates that studies aiming at the optimization of water and N inputs must consider interactions and optimize water and N inputs simultaneously. Based on our analyses, we estimated that reducing over-optimal irrigation to optimal irrigation may increase citrus yield by 20%, WUE by 30% and NUE by 15%. Similarly, reducing over-optimal N fertilization to optimal N fertilization may increase yield by 10%, WUE by 15% dnd NUE by 40%. We concluded that there is room for a significant increase in yield, WUE and NUE through the simultaneous optimization of water and fertilizer N inputs via precision fertigation.

82,excluded,"THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON DECOMPOSITION PROCESSES IN ANDEAN PARAMO ECOSYSTEM-SYNTHESIS, A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","The paramo is a high mountain ecosystem with cold and humid climate, it has high amount of sunlight and cloudiness, furthermore, organic matter has low decomposition rates, hence, leaf litter degradation gets 40% per year as maximum. In the last 70 years, the air temperature near the surface of the Tropical Andes has increased significantly up to 0.34 degrees C/decade. In the same region, it is estimated that in this century the average temperature will vary from <+ 1.60 degrees C to >+ 2.61 degrees C, which exceeds the threshold of natural climatic variability. On the other hand, although precipitation along the Andes has not shown an increase or diminish pattern between 1955 and 1994, it is projected that by the year 2100, it will decrease in the outer tropics and will increase in the interior tropics. In this paper, we discuss how the decomposition of organic matter in paramo areas is influenced by climate change and analyze how current trends of variation in temperature are projected to affect ecosystem processes. Previous studies have determined that the increase of the atmospheric temperature (as long as the humidity remains stable or increases), generates higher decomposition rates, so that an increase of 1 degrees C in the atmospheric temperature would also mean an increase in the rate of decomposition of up to 10%. These changes would cause the release of the carbon accumulated in the soil to the atmosphere as CO2, which would be a determining factor for climate change.",CO2; global warming; greenhouse gases; organic matter; temperature
83,included,Cover crop effects on soils and subsequent crops in the pampas: A meta-analysis,"Cover crops are a valuable management option for reducing soil erosion and nitrogen losses from agroecosystems. They improve soil quality but the impacts on crop yield depend on the type of cover crop, the commercial crop considered and the climate. In the Argentine Pampas the introduction of cover crops in rotations is being extensively studied by official institutions. We performed a meta-analysis with results of 67 local field experiments in which winter cover crop effects on soils and crops were analyzed. Soil physical properties improved after cover crops. Bulk density was minimally affected, structural stability and water infiltration increased, while soil penetration resistance decreased. Soil organic carbon content of the 0-20 cm layer rose ca. 4% in fine-textured soils and 9% in coarser ones. Nitrate-N decreased after cover crops by 30% regardless if the cover crop species was or was not legume. Soil available water at crop sowing was not affected by cover crops in the upper meter of the profile but when the cumulative water content was measured at depth (ca. 2m) it decreased by around 20%. Soybean (Glycine max) yield was barely affected by the previous cover crop or fallow treatment. Conversely, corn (Zea mays) yield tended to decrease when the cover crop was a non-legume (- 8%) or significantly increased after legume species (+7%) when compared to a fallow. In the Pampas, coyer crops have multifunctional benefits and their adoption will depend on the balance between these benefits, the sowing cost and some possible negative effects on corn yield. For this latter crop, legume cover crops are recommended. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",meta-analysis

Although, somatostatin (SOM) has been used in the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), the efficacy of SOM remains inconsistent. Methods: Electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), and the Science Citation Index were searched to retrieve relevant studies. Details of the study population, including patients' characteristics, sample size, regimen of drug administration and incidence of PEP, hyperamylasemia and abdominal pain were extracted by two investigators. Data were analyzed with Review Manager 5.3 software. Results: Eleven randomized controlled trials, enrolling a total of 4192 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. After data were pooled, we observed decreased incidence of ERCP-induced outcomes, such as PEP (RR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.98; P = 0.04) and hyperamylasemia (RR = 0.75, 95% Cl: 0.66, 0.84; P < 0.001) in patients treated with SOM than those with placebo. Subgroup analysis by ethnicity found decreased incidence of PEP and hyperamylasemia in Asia only. Subgroup analysis by treatment schedule and dosage revealed decreased incidence of PEP and hyperamylasemia when SOM were treated with a single bolus or long-term infusion, or at dose above 3000 mu g. We did not observed efficacy of SOM on abdominal pain in pooled or subgroup analysis. Conclusion: This meta-analysis of patients undergoing ERCP showed reduced incidence of PEP and hyperamylasemia when SOM was administrated with single bolus, long-term infusion, or high dosage.

85,excluded,Increased microbial activity under elevated [co2] does not enhance residue decomposition in a semi-arid cropping system in australia,"The association between the responses of microbial activity and residue decomposition to elevated atmospheric [CO2] under field conditions in Australian cropping systems is unknown. We measured soil CO2 emission and decomposition of wheat and field pea residues in a wheat cropping system in the field using the Australian Grains Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (AGFACE) facility in Horsham, Victoria. Elevated [CO2] (550 mu mol mol(-1)) increased soil CO2 emission by 41%, but did not affect the percentage of the original mass or C remaining for either type of residue throughout the experimental period. Our findings suggest that the rates of residue decomposition and residue C mineralization in this semi-arid wheat cropping system were not affected by elevated [CO2] despite higher microbial activity. This has major implication for the C sequestration potential of semi-arid cropping systems under future CO2 climates, (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
86,excluded,Soil carbon dynamics in a sitka spruce (picea sitchensis (bong.) Carr.) Chronosequence on a peaty gley,"We investigated whether the establishment of forests on organic grassland soils leads to significant losses in soil carbon, due to the site preparation for the planting of trees and other disturbances. We also investigated whether subsequent biomass accumulation over two consecutive rotations separated by a clearfell leads to a recovery in the initial soil carbon losses. Soil respiration, soil carbon stocks and annual litter fall were measured, while allometric equations were used for the estimation of above and belowground biomass, in a replicated forest chronosequence of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) on peaty gley soil, in Harwood Forest (NE England). The sites chosen were: 40-year-old first rotation stands, 12, 20 and a 30-year-old second rotation stands, one 18-month-old clearfelled site and unplanted natural grassland sites. The soil carbon stock of the first-rotation 40-year-old stands was 140 +/- 15 t C ha(-1), far lower than in the surrounding unplanted grasslands (274 +/- 54 t C ha(-1)), while clearfelling caused a further decline (100 +/- 13 t C ha(-1)). Soil carbon accumulated again as the forest grew during the second rotation (147 +/- 8, 181 +/- 17 and 249 +/- 40 t C ha(-1) at the 12, 20 and 30-year-old stands, respectively). Soil respiration was the highest at the grassland site year possibly due to high respiration by the grasses. After forest establishment, soil respiration was: 2.3 +/- 0.9, 2.2 +/- 0.7, 5.4 +/- 0.7 and 5.0 +/- 0.4 t C ha(-1) year(-1) at the age of 12, 20, 30 and 40 years, while in the clearfelled site soil respiration was 5.6 +/- 1.6 t C ha(-1) year. The inputs and outputs of carbon into the soil were combined to evaluate the long-term effects of forest management on soil carbon dynamics. It was concluded that the establishment of coniferous forests on peaty gley grassland soils in the uplands can lead to a net accumulation of soil carbon during the second rotation.

87,excluded,Acute stress among adolescents and female rape victims measured by asc-kids: a pilot study,"Background: Rape is considered a stressful trauma and often with durable consequences. How the aftermath of rape is for young adolescents' girls considering acute stress is an overlooked field and remains to be studied. Aims: In this study, we wanted to investigate acute stress among adolescent victims of rape and the psychometric properties of the Acute Stress Checklist for Children (ASC-Kids). Methods: A clinical sample (n = 79) of raped girls, 13 - 17 years old who had turned to a special rape victim unit for treatment, answered the ASC-Kids. ASC-Kids was also given to a group of minor stressed, non-raped adolescents in the same age range (n = 154) together with the University of California at Los Angeles Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index (UCLA PTSD RI), and the Sense of Coherence Scale 13 (SOC-13). Results : The scores from the groups were compared and showed significant differences in mean values on all the diagnostic criteria of acute stress disorder. In the clinical group, 36.7% obtained full ASD criteria. ASC-Kids could discriminate well between groups. Cronbach's alpha was found to be excellent, and the correlation between the UCLA PTSD RI and ASC-Kids found to be good; both ASC-Kids and UCLA PTSD RI had a good and moderate negative correlation with SOC-13. Conclusion: Adolescent female rape victims were shown to have a very high level of acute stress, and the ASC-Kids was found to have sound psychometrics and can be a valuable screening instrument to support clinicians in their assessments of an indication of adolescents after potentially stressful events such as rape.",
88,excluded,Predicting yields of short-rotation hybrid poplar (populus spp.) For the united states through model-data synthesis,"Hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) is an important biomass crop being evaluated for cellulosic ethanol production. Predictions of poplar growth, rotation period, and soil carbon sequestration under various growing conditions, soils, and climates are critical for farmers and managers planning to establish short-rotation forestry (SRF) plantations. In this study, we used an ecoinformatics workflow, the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn), to integrate literature data and field measurements into the Ecosystem Demography 2 (ED2) model to estimate yield potential of poplar plantations. Within PEcAn 164 records of seven different traits from the literature were assimilated using a Bayesian meta-analysis. Next, variance decomposition identified seven variables for further constraint that contributed > 80% to the uncertainty in modeled yields: growth respiration, dark respiration, quantum efficiency, mortality coefficient, water conductance, fine-root allocation, and root turnover rate. Assimilation of observed yields further constrained uncertainty in model parameters (especially dark respiration and root turnover rate) and biomass estimates. Additional measurements of growth respiration, mortality, water conductance, and quantum efficiency would provide the most efficient path toward further constraint of modeled yields. Modeled validation demonstrated that ED2 successfully captured the interannual and spatial variability of poplar yield observed at nine independent sites. Site-level analyses were conducted to estimate the effect of land use change to SRF poplar on soil C sequestration compared to alternate land uses. These suggest that poplar plantations became a C sink within 18 years of conversion from corn production or existing forest. Finally, poplar yields were estimated for the contiguous United States at a half degree resolution in order to determine potential productivity, estimate the optimal rotation period, and compare poplar to perennial grass yields. This regional projection suggests that poplar yield varies considerably with differences in soil and climate, reaching as much as 18 Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1) in eastern, southern, and northwest regions. In New England, the upper Midwest, and northern California, yields are predicted to exceed those of the highly productive C-4 perennial grass, Miscanthus. In these poplar-productive regions, 4-11 year rotations give the highest potential yields. In conclusion, poplar plantations are predicted to have a high yield potential across a wide range of climates and soils and could be sustainable in soil C sequestration.",
89,excluded,Nonpharmacological approaches to the management of chronic pain in community-dwelling older adults: a review of empirical evidence,"The objective of this literature review is to gain insight into the efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions in chronic pain management in community-dwelling older adults. An extensive search of pertinent databases was performed to identify reports of studies of nonpharmacological (physical and psychosocial) pain interventions. The review identifies intervention studies that used randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and summarizes existing evidence of effectiveness of nonpharmacological interventions. A literature search yielded 28 RCT intervention studies (18 for physical interventions and 10 for psychosocial interventions) that met inclusion criteria and are included in this review. Twenty-one studies (75%) identified in this review demonstrated statistically significant differences (P <.05) in pain scores between nonpharmacological interventions and no intervention or sham interventions; the intervention groups showed lower pain intensity. More research is needed to determine the best format, intensity, duration, and content of such treatments, as well as their efficacy in the older adult population. Methodological limitations are identified in many of the studies, such as low statistical power due to sample size and imprecise measurement, lack of reliable sham controls, and inadequate blinding. Future intervention studies of nonpharmacological pain therapies may require larger sample sizes, control for comorbidities, and long-term follow-up. J Am Geriatr Soc 60:555-568, 2012.",

In this study, we examined the association between CM-SJS/TEN with SOC and the IKZF1 SNPs in the Thai population. Methods 57 CM-SJS/TEN with SOC and 171 control samples were collected at Chulalongkorn University and Mahidol University. Genomic DNA samples were genotyped for the IKZF1 SNPs at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine in Japan using the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Results The four SNPs previously reported to be associated with CM-SJS/TEN with SOC in the Japanese were examined in the Thai samples. Although the number of Thai cases (n = 57) was small, a significant association between CM-SJS/TEN with SOC and IKZF1 SNPs which included rs4917014 (T vs G, OR = 2.9, p = 0.0012, Pc = 0.0049), rs4917129 (T vs C, OR = 2.8, p = 0.0026, Pc = 0.010) and rs10276619 (G vs A, OR = 1.8, p = 0.012, Pc = 0.048) was identified. Conclusion In addition to the Japanese, Korean and Indian populations, Thai cases with CM-SJS/TEN and SOC were significantly associated with IKZF1 SNPs. With our previous report of the critical role of IKZF1 in mucocutaneous inflammation, these results suggest that IKZF1 is important in the pathogenesis of CM-SJS/TEN with SOC.",Stevens-Johnson syndrome; Cold medicine; Severe ocular complications; SNPs; IKZF1
91,included,The impact of land use and cover change on soil organic carbon and total nitrogen storage in the Heihe River Basin: A meta-analysis,"Land use and cover change (LUCC) is an important indicator of the human-earth system under climate/environmental change, which also serves as a key impact factor of carbon balance, and a major source/sink of soil carbon cycles. The Heihe River Basin (HRB) is known as a typical ecologically fragile area in the arid/semi-arid regions of northwestern China, which makes it more sensitive to the LUCC. However, its sensitivity varies in a broad range of controlling factors, such as soil layers, LUCCs and calculation methods (e.g. the fixed depth method, FD, and the equivalent mass method, ESM). In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) storage to the LUCC as well as method bias based on 383 sets of SOC data and 148 sets of TN data from the HRB. We first evaluated the calculation methods and found that based on the FD method, the LUCC caused SOC and TN storage to decrease by 17.39% and 14.27%, respectively; while the losses estimated using the ESM method were 19.31% and 18.52%, respectively. The deviations between two methods were mainly due to the fact that the FD method ignores the heterogeneity of soil bulk density (BD), which may underestimate the results subsequently. We then analyzed the response of SOC and TN storage to various types of the LUCC. In particular, when woodland and grassland were converted into cultivated land or other land types, SOC and TN suffered from heavy losses, while other LUCCs had minor influences. Finally, we showed that increasing the depth of the soil layers would reduce the losses of SOC and TN storage. In summary, we identified a series of controlling factors (e.g. soil layer, the LUCC and calculation method) to evaluate the impact of the LUCC on SOC and TN storage in the HRB, which should be considered in future research.",Heihe River Basin; LUCC; meta-analysis; soil organic carbon; total nitrogen

DESIGN: Longitudinal, population-based dementia study. SETTING: Rural county in northern Utah, at-home evaluations. PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand four hundred ninety-one participants without dementia (51% male, average age 73.0 5,7; average education 13.7 4.1 years) initially reported no problems in activities of daily living and no stroke or head injury within the past 5 years. MEASUREMENTS: Six dichotomized lifestyle behaviors were examined (diet: high >= median on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension scale; exercise: > 5 h/wk of light activity and at least occasional moderate to vigorous activity; church attendance: attending church services at least weekly; social Interaction: spending time with family and friends at least twice weekly; alcohol: currently drinking alcoholic beverages > 2 times/wk; nonsmoker: no current use or fewer than 100 cigarettes ever). Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify patterns among these behaviors. Proportional hazards regression modeled time to dementia onset as a function of behavioral class, age, sex, education, and apolipoprotein E status. Follow-up averaged 6.3 +/- 5.3 years, during which 278 cases of incident dementia (200 Alzheimer's disease (AD)) were diagnosed. RESULTS: LCA identified four distinct lifestyle classes. Unhealthy religious (UH-R; 11.5%), unhealthy nonreligious (UH-NR; 10.5%), healthy moderately religious (H-MR; 38.5%), and healthy very religious (H-VR; 39.5%). UH-NR (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.54, P =.028), H-MR (HR = 0.56, P =.003), and H-VR (HR = 0.58, P =.005) had significantly lower dementia risk than UHR. Results were comparable for AD, except that UH-NR was less definitive.

93,excluded,"Ectomycorrhiza, friend or foe?","Many ecology textbooks present the interaction between mycorrhizal fungi and their host plants as the archetype of symbiosis or mutualism. However, mycorrhiza drains carbon directly from the plant and also competes with the plant for soil inorganic nitrogen. We developed hypotheses based on a simple model to qualitatively investigate when, in a nitrogen-limited system, the fungal partner returns sufficient extra nitrogen to compensate for the amount of carbon allocated to it by the plant. We showed when the mycorrhizal association can be beneficial to the plant, but also when mycorrhizal immobilization of soil inorganic nitrogen can be a limitation. The amount of carbon and nitrogen that the mycorrhizal fungus can obtain from soil organic matter, by producing extracellular enzymes, is also important. Saprotrophic capability decreases the value of the fungus to the plant, as fungal uptake of soil carbon augments the use of the plant-supplied carbon and increases the fungal requirement for N. The stoichiometric mismatch between low-N soil organic matter and high-N fungal biochemistry turned out to be a bottleneck in making the fungus a net provider of additional N to the plant. The most important properties determining the usefulness to a plant of a mycorrhizal symbiont are plant nitrogen use efficiency and the amount of inorganic N taken up per unit extra fungal growth. The fraction of carbon the fungus allocates to its own growth, relative to its investment in exocellular enzymes, is also a critical property. Our results show that plants could benefit from the association with the fungus, which could explain the ubiquitous nature of this association between fungi and plants.",allocation; mycorrhiza; nitrogen; parasitism; plant growth; symbiosis
94,included,Soil organic carbon and land use: Processes and potential in Ontario's long-term agro-ecosystem research sites,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) is crucial for maintaining a productive agro- ecosystem. Long- term research must be synthesized to understand the effects of land management on SOC storage and to develop best practices to prevent soil degradation. Therefore, this review compiled an inventory of long- term Ontario studies and assessed SOC storage under common Ontario land management regimes via a meta- analysis and literature review. In general, greater SOC storage occurred in no- till (NT) vs. tillage systems, in crop rotation vs. continuous corn, and in N fertilizer vs. no N fertilizer systems; however, soil texture and perhaps drainage class may determine the effects of tillage. The effect on SOC storage was variable when deeper soil depth ranges (0-45 cm) were considered for NT and rotational cropping, which suggests an unpredictable effect of land management on SOC at depths below the plough layer. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to use the presented inventory of nine long- term research sites and 18 active experiments in Ontario to pursue coordinated studies of long- term land management on SOC at depths extending below the plough layer.",Meta-analysis; inventory of long-term experiments; soil organic carbon; no-tillage; crop rotation; nitrogen fertilizer
95,excluded,Two independent value orientations: ideal and counter-ideal leader values and their impact on followers' respect for and identification with their leaders,"Traditionally, conceptualizations of human values are based on the assumption that individuals possess a single integrated value system comprising those values that people are attracted by and strive for. Recently, however, van Quaquebeke et al. (in J Bus Ethics 93:293-305, 2010) proposed that a value system might consist of two largely independent value orientations-an orientation of ideal values and an orientation of counter-ideal values (values that individuals are repelled by), and that both orientations exhibit antithetic effects on people's responses to the social world. Following a call for further research on this distinction, we conducted two studies to assess the independent effects of ideal and counter-ideal values in leadership settings. Study 1 (N = 131) finds both value orientations to explain unique variance in followers' vertical respect for their leaders. Study 2 (N = 136) confirms these results and additionally shows an analogous effect for followers' identification with their leaders. Most importantly, we find that both value orientations exhibit their effects only independently when the content of the two orientations pertain to different value types in Schwartz's (in J Soc Issues 50:19-46, 1994) circumplex model.

96,excluded,Biological controls over the abundances of terrestrial ammonia oxidizers,"Aim Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) are the primary agents for nitrification, converting ammonia (NH4+) into nitrate (NO3-) and modulating plant nitrogen (N) utilization and terrestrial N retention. However, there is still lack of a unifying framework describing the patterns of global AOA and AOB distribution. In particular, biotic interactions are rarely integrated into any of the conceptual models. Location World-wide. Time period 2005-2016. Major taxa studied Ammonia-oxidizing archaea and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Methods A meta-analysis and synthesis were conducted to obtain a general picture of global AOA and AOB distribution and identify the primary driving factors. A microcosm experiment was then conducted to assess effects of relative carbon to nitrogen availability for heterotrophic microbes on AOA and AOB in two distinct soils. A mesocosm experiment was further carried out to characterize the effects of plant roots and their arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on AOA and AOB abundances using hyphae- or root-ingrowth techniques. Results Our meta-analysis showed that soil carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios explained the most variance in AOA and AOB abundances, although soil pH had a significant effect. Experimental results demonstrated that high cellulose and mineral N inputs increased total microbial biomass and microbial activities, but inhibited AOA and AOB, suggesting microbial inhibition of AOA and AOB. Also, AMF and roots suppressed AOA and AOB, respectively. Main conclusions Our study provides convincing evidence illustrating that relative carbon to nitrogen availability can predominantly affect the abundances of AOA and AOB. Our experimental results further validate that biotic competition among plants, heterotrophic microbes and ammonia oxidizers for substrate N is the predominant control upon AOA and AOB abundances. Together, these findings provide new insights into the role of abiotic and biotic factors in modulating terrestrial AOA and AOB abundances and their potential applications for management of nitrification in an increasing reactive N world.",ammonia-oxidizing archaea; ammonia-oxidizing bacteria; competition; meta-analysis; nitrification; soil C; N ratio
97,excluded,Associations between hemodialysis access type and clinical outcomes: a systematic review,"Clinical practice guidelines recommend an arteriovenous fistula as the preferred vascular access for hemodialysis, but quantitative associations between vascular access type and various clinical outcomes remain controversial. We performed a systematic review of cohort studies to evaluate the associations between type of vascular access (arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous graft, and central venous catheter) and risk for death, infection, and major cardiovascular events. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and article reference lists and extracted data describing study design, participants, vascular access type, clinical outcomes, and risk for bias. We identified 3965 citations, of which 67 (62 cohort studies comprising 586,337 participants) met our inclusion criteria. In a random effects meta-analysis, compared with persons with fistulas, those individuals using catheters had higher risks for all-cause mortality (risk ratio=1.53, 95% CI=1.41-1.67), fatal infections (2.12, 1.79-2.52), and cardiovascular events (1.38, 1.24-1.54). Similarly, compared with persons with grafts, those individuals using catheters had higher risks for mortality (1.38, 1.25-1.52), fatal infections (1.49, 1.15-1.93), and cardiovascular events (1.26, 1.11-1.43). Compared with persons with fistulas, those individuals with grafts had increased all-cause mortality (1.18, 1.09-1.27) and fatal infection (1.36, 1.17-1.58), but we did not detect a difference in the risk for cardiovascular events (1.07, 0.95-1.21). The risk for bias, especially selection bias, was high. In conclusion, persons using catheters for hemodialysis seem to have the highest risks for death, infections, and cardiovascular events compared with other vascular access types, and patients with usable fistulas have the lowest risk.

98,included,Trade-offs between soil carbon sequestration and reactive nitrogen losses under straw return in global agroecosystems,"It is widely recommended that crop straw be returned to croplands to maintain or increase soil carbon (C) storage in arable soils. However, because C and nitrogen (N) biogeochemical cycles are closely coupled, straw return may also affect soil reactive N (Nr) losses, but these effects remain uncertain, especially in terms of the interactions between soil C sequestration and Nr losses under straw addition. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis using 363 publications to assess the overall effects of straw return on soil Nr losses, C sequestration and crop productivity in agroecosystems. Our results show that on average, compared to mineral N fertilization, straw return with same amount of mineral N fertilizer significantly increased soil organic C (SOC) content (14.9%), crop yield (5.1%), and crop N uptake (10.9%). Moreover, Nr losses in the form of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from rice paddies (17.3%), N leaching (8.7%), and runoff (25.6%) were significantly reduced, mainly due to enhanced microbial N immobilization. However, N2O emissions from upland fields (21.5%) and ammonia (NH3) emissions (17.0%) significantly increased following straw return, mainly due to the stimulation of nitrification/denitrification and soil urease activity. The increase in NH3 and N2O emissions was significantly and negatively correlated with straw C/N ratio and soil clay content. Regarding the interactions between C sequestration and Nr losses, the increase in SOC content following straw return was significantly and positively correlated with the decrease in N leaching and runoff. However, at a global scale, straw return increased net Nr losses from both rice and upland fields due to a greater stimulation of NH3 emissions than the reduction in N leaching and runoff. The trade-offs between increased net Nr losses and soil C sequestration highlight the importance of reasonably managing straw return to soils to limit NH3 emissions without decreasing associated C sequestration potential.",ammonia emission; carbon sequestration; crop productivity; reactive N losses; straw return; trade-off relationship
99,included,Agroforestry delivers a win-win solution for ecosystem services in sub-Saharan Africa. A meta-analysis,"Agricultural landscapes are increasingly being managed with the aim of enhancing the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services and sustainability of production systems. However, agricultural management that maximizes provisioning ecosystem services can often reduce both regulating and maintenance services. We hypothesized that agroforestry reduces trade-offs between provisioning and regulating/maintenance services. We conducted a quantitative synthesis of studies carried out in sub-Saharan Africa focusing on crop yield (as an indicator of provisioning services), soil fertility, erosion control, and water regulation (as indicators of regulating/maintenance services). A total of 1106 observations were extracted from 126 peer-reviewed publications that fulfilled the selection criteria for meta-analysis of studies comparing agroforestry and non-agroforestry practices (hereafter control) in sub-Saharan Africa. Across ecological conditions, agroforestry significantly increased crop yield, total soil nitrogen, soil organic carbon, and available phosphorus compared to the control. Agroforestry practices also reduced runoff and soil loss and improved infiltration rates and soil moisture content. No significant differences were detected between the different ecological conditions, management regimes, and types of woody perennials for any of the ecosystem services. Main trade-offs included low available phosphorus and low soil moisture against higher crop yield. This is the first meta-analysis that shows that, on average, agroforestry systems in sub-Saharan Africa increase crop yield while maintaining delivery of regulating/maintenance ecosystem services. We also demonstrate how woody perennials have been managed in agricultural landscapes to provide multiple ecosystem services without sacrificing crop productivity. This is important in rural livelihoods where the range of ecosystem services conveys benefits in terms of food security and resilience to environmental shocks.",Available phosphorus; Infiltration; Runoff; Soil erosion; Soil organic carbon; Soil moisture content; Trade-off
100,excluded,Relations of meaning in life and sense of coherence to distress in cancer patients: a meta-analysis,"ObjectiveCancer patients report high rates of distress. The related constructs of meaning in life (MiL) and sense of coherence (SOC) have long been recognized as important factors in the psychological adjustment to cancer; however, both constructs' associations with distress have not been quantitatively reviewed or compared in this population. Informed by Park's integrated meaning-making model and Antonovsky's salutogenic model, the goals of this meta-analysis were the following: (1) to compare the strength of MiL-distress and SOC-distress associations in cancer patients; and (2) to examine potential moderators of both associations (i.e., age, gender, ethnicity, religious affiliation, disease stage, and time since diagnosis). MethodsA literature search was conducted using electronic databases. Overall, 62 records met inclusion criteria. The average MiL-distress and SOC-distress associations were quantified as Pearson's r correlation coefficients and compared using a one-way ANOVA. ResultsBoth MiL and SOC demonstrated significant, negative associations with distress (r=-0.41, 95% CI: -0.47 to -0.35, k=44; and r=-0.59, 95% CI: -0.67 to -0.51, k=18, respectively). Moreover, the MiL-distress association was significantly smaller than the SOC-distress association (Q(b)=10.42, df=1, p<0.01). Neither association varied by the tested moderators. ConclusionsFindings provide support for the clinical relevance of MiL and SOC across demographic and medical subgroups of cancer patients. The strength of the SOC-distress association suggests that incorporating aspects of SOC (e.g., the perceived manageability of life circumstances) into meaning-centered interventions may improve their effectiveness for distressed cancer patients.

101,excluded,Variability of the n-15 chemical shielding tensors in the b3 domain of protein g from n-15 relaxation measurements at several fields. Implications for backbone order parameters,"We applied a combination of N-15 relaxation and CSA/dipolar cross-correlation measurements at five magnetic fields (9.4, 11.7, 14.1, 16.4, and 18.8 T) to determine the 15N chemical shielding tensors for backbone amides in protein G in solution. The data were analyzed using various model-independent approaches and those based on Lipari-Szabo approximation, all of them yielding similar results. The results indicate a range of site-specific values of the anisotropy (CSA) and orientation of the 15N chemical shielding tensor, similar to those in ubiquitin (Fushman, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998, 120, 10947; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 8577). Assuming a Gaussian distribution of the 15N CSA values, the mean anisotropy is -173.9 to -177.2 ppm (for 1.02 angstrom NH bond length) and the site-to-site CSA variability is +/- 17.6 to +/- 21.4 ppm, depending on the method used. This CSA variability is significantly larger than derived previously for ribonuclease H (Kroenke, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 10119) or recently, using ""meta-analysis"" for ubiquitin (Damberg, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 1995). Standard interpretation of N-15 relaxation studies of backbone dynamics in proteins involves an a priori assumption of a uniform 15N CSA. We show that this assumption leads to a significant discrepancy between the order parameters obtained at different fields. Using the site-specific CSAs obtained from our study removes this discrepancy and allows simultaneous fit of relaxation data at all five fields to Lipari-Szabo spectral densities. These findings emphasize the necessity of taking into account the variability of N-15 CSA for accurate analysis of protein dynamics from N-15 relaxation measurements.",
102,excluded,Towards a physical description of habitat: quantifying environmental adversity (abiotic stress) in temperate forest and woodland ecosystems,"P>Our aim was to develop a quantitative proxy for environmental adversity (abiotic stress) in temperate Eucalyptus and Nothofagus forest and woodland ecosystems. Samples and measurements were collected at 42 sites across a rainfall gradient in southern Australia, an elevation gradient in south-eastern Australia, and a longitudinal transect (temperature gradient) in Patagonia, Argentina. We compared the ability of (a) abiotic variables (14 soil and 21 climatic variables) and (b) the stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) values of soil organic matter (SOM), to predict variation in leaf area index (LAI; a forest productivity variable). The delta C-13 of SOM (soil aggregates) explained more variation (57%) in LAI than multivariate statistical models that integrated information on many abiotic variables. W* (a climatic water balance model) was also a powerful predictor variable, explaining 37% of the variability in LAI. Synthesis. The stable carbon isotopic signature of soil aggregates is a powerful explanatory variable that may help us to quantify environmental adversity (abiotic stress) in temperate forest and woodland ecosystems.",
103,excluded,Inhaler review in older adults with asthma or copd: a cost-effectiveness study and a perspective in portugal,"OBJECTIVES Older patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are particularly susceptible to exacerbations that may be associated with incorrect use of inhalers. Educational programs with inhaler technique review seem to be effective, but no studies have addressed their cost-effectiveness in older adult patients. The objective was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of education programs in older patients and estimate the cost benefit of applying such a program in Portugal. DESIGN We developed a decision tree analysis from a healthcare perspective, according to intervention costs and the exacerbation rates and costs described in a previous meta-analysis. A sensitivity analysis of worst and best case scenarios was performed to estimate thresholds for intervention affordable limits, as well as cost-saving estimations and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for a Portuguese scenario. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS We estimated cost-effectiveness thresholds applicable in all settings and performed a sensitivity analysis of a theoretical intervention model in all patients including an inhaler technique review at an annual appointment with a doctor and a nurse. RESULTS In the best case scenario, the intervention affordable budget could be up to almost 1800euro (US $1585.24) per patient per year. Mean intervention-associated savings in Portugal would be 311.88euro (US $274.68) per patient per year, representing annual savings up to euro131 million (US $150 million) for the whole health system, already including intervention costs. ICERs for Portugal vary between 93.73euro (US $82.55) and 437.43euro (US $385.25) per exacerbation avoided. CONCLUSION A model of an intervention program with an inhaler technique review in older adult patients suggests that this intervention is cost-effective and can generate significant savings.

104,included,Interactions between plant growth and soil nutrient cycling under elevated CO2: a meta-analysis,"free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) and open top chamber (OTC) studies are valuable tools for evaluating the impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 on nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Using meta-analytic techniques, we summarized the results of 117 studies on plant biomass production, soil organic matter dynamics and biological N-2 fixation in FACE and OTC experiments. The objective of the analysis was to determine whether elevated CO2 alters nutrient cycling between plants and soil and if so, what the implications are for soil carbon (C) sequestration. Elevated CO2 stimulated gross N immobilization by 22%, whereas gross and net N mineralization rates remained unaffected. In addition, the soil C : N ratio and microbial N contents increased under elevated CO2 by 3.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Microbial C contents and soil respiration increased by 7.1% and 17.7%, respectively. Despite the stimulation of microbial activity, soil C input still caused soil C contents to increase by 1.2% yr(-1). Namely, elevated CO2 stimulated overall above- and belowground plant biomass by 21.5% and 28.3%, respectively, thereby outweighing the increase in CO2 respiration. In addition, when comparing experiments under both low and high N availability, soil C contents (+2.2% yr(-1)) and above- and belowground plant growth (+20.1% and+33.7%) only increased under elevated CO2 in experiments receiving the high N treatments. Under low N availability, above- and belowground plant growth increased by only 8.8% and 14.6%, and soil C contents did not increase. Nitrogen fixation was stimulated by elevated CO2 only when additional nutrients were supplied. These results suggest that the main driver of soil C sequestration is soil C input through plant growth, which is strongly controlled by nutrient availability. In unfertilized ecosystems, microbial N immobilization enhances acclimation of plant growth to elevated CO2 in the long-term. Therefore, increased soil C input and soil C sequestration under elevated CO2 can only be sustained in the long-term when additional nutrients are supplied.",elevated CO2; meta-analysis; plant production; soil C cycling; soil N; cycling
105,excluded,Application of a two-pool model to soil carbon dynamics under elevated CO2,"Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations increase plant productivity and affect soil microbial communities, with possible consequences for the turnover rate of soil carbon (C) pools and feedbacks to the atmosphere. In a previous analysis (Van Groenigen etal., 2014), we used experimental data to inform a one-pool model and showed that elevated CO2 increases the decomposition rate of soil organic C, negating the storage potential of soil. However, a two-pool soil model can potentially explain patterns of soil C dynamics without invoking effects of CO2 on decomposition rates. To address this issue, we refit our data to a two-pool soil C model. We found that CO2 enrichment increases decomposition rates of both fast and slow C pools. In addition, elevated CO2 decreased the carbon use efficiency of soil microbes (CUE), thereby further reducing soil C storage. These findings are consistent with numerous empirical studies and corroborate the results from our previous analysis. To facilitate understanding of C dynamics, we suggest that empirical and theoretical studies incorporate multiple soil C pools with potentially variable decomposition rates.",carbon cycle; data assimilation; data-model fusion; priming; soil carbon model
106,included,Emission of CO2 from biochar-amended soils and implications for soil organic carbon,"Soil amendment with pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM), also named biochar, is claimed to sequester carbon (C). However, possible interactions between PyOM and native soil organic carbon (SOC) may accelerate the loss of SOC, thus reducing PyOM's C sequestration potential. We combined the results of 46 studies in a meta-analysis to investigate changes in CO2 emission of PyOM-amended soils and to identify the causes of these changes and the possible factors involved. Our results showed a statistically significant increase of 28% in CO2 emission from PyOM-amended soils. When grouped by PyOM C (PyC):SOC ratios, the group of studies with a ratio >2 showed a significant increase in CO2 emissions, but those with a ratio <2 showed no significant effect of PyOM application on CO2 emission. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that increased CO2 emission after PyOM addition is additive and mainly derived from PyOM's labile C fractions. The PyC:SOC ratio provided the best predictor of increases in CO2 production after PyOM addition to soil. This meta-analysis highlights the importance of taking into account the amount of applied PyC in relation to SOC for designing future decomposition experiments.",additive effects; carbon sequestration; decomposition; priming; pyrogenic organic matter; recalcitrance
107,excluded,Academic expectations and actual achievements: the roles of hope and effort,"This study sought to extend the research on adolescents' hope, academic expectations, and average grades. The hope theory (Snyder, Psychological Inquiry 13(4):249-275, 2002), the salutogenic paradigm (with a focus on sense of coherence (SOC) (Antonovsky 1987)), and Bandura's (Journal of Management 38(1):9-44, 2012) social learning theory (with a focus on three self-efficacy (SE) constructs: academic SE, social SE, and emotional SE), were used as an integrated conceptual framework for predicting expected and actual academic performance. The sample consisted of 289 10th grade high school students (152 girls and 137 boys). The structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis provided support for the hypothesized modified model. The results demonstrated that hopeful thinking had a direct effect on grade expectations, which, in turn, predicted academic achievement. In addition, SOC, social SE, emotional SE, and academic SE were interrelated, but only emotional SE and SOC contributed directly to hope. Academic SE predicted effort, which also contributed to hope. Thus, the relations between students' investment of effort and actual grades were predicted indirectly through hopeful thinking and grade expectations. The implications for future research and the field of educational psychology of using hope, SOC, and SE as an integrated conceptual framework for predicting academic outcomes are discussed.",
108,excluded,Changes in soil phosphorus and its influencing factors following afforestation in northern china,"Changes in soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks following afforestation have been widely studied at different scales. However, soil phosphorus (P) dynamics following afforestation are poorly understood, especially at the regional scale. This paper studied the effects of prior land use (cropland, grassland, and barren land), tree species (conifer, broadleaf, shrub, and mixed), plantation age (young, middle, and old), and climate on soil total phosphorus and available phosphorus stocks change in the top 20 cm following afforestation based on a synthesis of 50 recent publications in northern China. We also considered possible confounding effects between these factors. The results showed that, overall, soil total phosphorus and available phosphorus stocks significantly decreased by 7.3% and significantly increased by 8.8%, respectively, following afforestation. Prior land use was found to be the most important driver in determining changes in soil P stocks. Compared with a significant decrease in P of afforestation of former cropland and grassland, afforestation of barren land caused no clear decrease in P. Tree species was found to have a limited effect on changes in soil P after afforestation, and broadleaf afforestation has a lower P demand than coniferous forests in the studied region. Plantation age did not affect the dynamics of P stocks. Our results showed confounding effects of precipitation, prior land use, and tree species, which impacted the estimates of the drivers of changes in P stocks. These results highlighted the importance of tree species selection and replication across sites that receive different amounts of precipitation.",afforestation; influencing factors; northern China; soil available phosphorus; soil total phosphorus
109,excluded,Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery and acute kidney injury: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Background and objectives: Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been advocated to cause less inflammation, morbidity, and mortality than the more traditional on-pump technique. This meta-analysis compares these two surgical techniques with respect to causing acute kidney injury (AKI). Design, setting, participants, & measurements: This study searched for randomized controlled trials in MEDLINE and abstracts from the proceedings of scientific meetings through February 2010. Included were trials comparing off-pump to on-pump CABG that reported the incidence of AKI, as defined by a mixture of criteria including biochemical parameter/urine output/dialysis requirement. Mortality was evaluated among the studies that reported kidney-related outcomes. For primary and subgroup analyses, fixed-effect meta-analyses of odds ratios (OR) were performed. Results: In 22 identified trials (4819 patients), the weighted incidence of AKI in the on-pump CABG group was 4.0% (95% confidence interval 1.8%, 8.5%), dialysis requirement 2.4% (95% CI 1.6%, 3.7%), and mortality 2.6% (95% CI 1.6%, 4.0%). By meta-analysis, off-pump CABG was associated with a 40% lower odds of postoperative AKI (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.43, 0.84; P = 0.003) and a nonsignificant 33% lower odds for dialysis requirement (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.40, 1.12; P = 0.12). Within the selected trials, off-pump CABG was not associated with a significant decrease in mortality. Conclusions: Off-pump CABG may be associated with a lower incidence of postoperative AKI but may not affect dialysis requirement, a serious complication of cardiac surgery. However, the different definitions of AKI used in individual trials and methodological concerns preclude definitive conclusions. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 5: 1734-1744, 2010. doi: 10.2215/CJN.02800310",
110,included,Effects of grazing exclusion on carbon sequestration and plant diversity in grasslands of China A meta-analysis,"Widespread land degradation has strengthened the urgent need to restore overgrazing grasslands. China has implemented the program ‘Returning Grazing Land to Grassland’ (RGLG) through grazing exclusion by fence since 2003. Despite a lot of field experiments, there is still controversy on the effects of grazing exclusion on rangeland restoration, highlighting the need for synthetic analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis of 447 entries from 78 papers to analyze the spatiotemporal effects of grazing exclusion on plant diversity, productivity and soil carbon sequestration in the major RGLG-implemented provinces of China. Our results showed that, compared with the grazed sites, grazing exclusion significantly increased carbon stored in aboveground biomass, litter mass, belowground biomass and soils by 84.7%, 111.6%, 25.5% and 14.4%, respectively. Plant coverage, soil available nitrogen, soil available phosphorus and soil microbial biomass carbon increased by 52.0%, 21.7% 22.8% and 26.3%, respectively. However, grazing exclusion had little effects on recovering plant diversity in China’s grasslands. Of the factors examined, climatic factors strongly modified the effects of grazing exclusion on ecosystem carbon stocks, for example, precipitation significantly amplified the positive effects. Grazing exclusion played a positive role in soil carbon sequestration in most grassland types except in temperate desert-steppe. But annual soil carbon sequestration rates decayed rapidly over time in both alpine meadow and temperate steppe. Short-term (≤5years) grazing exclusion remarkably increased species richness, but not significantly in the long run. The threshold from neutral to negative effects of grazing exclusion on species evenness occurs after approximately ten years. Our findings provide evidence that grazing exclusion is an effective way to restore vegetation and sequestrate carbon in degraded grasslands, but not beneficial to plant diversity maintenance. The benefits of grazing exclusion are more effective in humid area than arid area. We suggest that grazing exclusion should be ceased after about six to ten years. Additionally, grazing exclusion should integrate with other appropriate management practices instead of operating on a stand-alone basis.",grasslands
111,excluded,Soil carbon changes in paddy fields amended with fly ash,"Increasing soil carbon (C) sequestration in the agricultural sector is an important strategy for mitigating climate change; however, conventional best management practices such as crop residue retention and organic fertilizer application do not always increase soil C content due to C loss by cultivation. In this context, application of fine textured minerals such as coal fly ash (FA) may be effective in increasing soil C sequestration by enhancing plant biomass production and protecting soil C from being lost. We conducted a three-year field experiment in a paddy field with three levels of FA application (0, 5, and 10% by soil weight) in combination with the following four nitrogen (N) treatments: no input, and applications of urea, pig manure compost (compost) and hairy vetch (Vida Villosa Roth.) green manure (vetch). Across the three seasons, rice grain yield was in the order of vetch = urea > compost > no input, reflecting the effect of N availability in each treatment. Application of FA (particularly at 10%) reduced the total rice plant biomass by hampering tillering. However, FA application did not reduce grain yield due to increased individual grain weight. In spite of decreased rice residue incorporation into the soil, FA application increased the soil C content at the end of the third season regardless of the N source, driven by reduced soil C loss. We conclude that the application of mineral soil amendments such as FA is effective in enhancing soil C sequestration without decreasing rice yield in paddy fields.",Compost; Green manure; Mineral amendment; Rice grain yield; Soil carbon sequestration; Synthetic fertilizer

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of 1 year of evolocumab in a pooled analysis of patients from the 12-week YUKAWA studies who continued into the open-label extension (OLE) OSLER studies. Methods and Results: YUKAWA-1 and YUKAWA-2 were conducted in hypercholesterolemic, high-cardiovascular-risk Japanese patients who were receiving statin therapy. Patients completing these studies were eligible for an OLE study. At OLE entry, patients were re-randomized 2: 1 to evolocumab+standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone (OSLER-1: evolocumab 420 mg monthly; OSLER-2: evolocumab 140 mg biweekly or 420 mg monthly). A 1-year analysis was performed on patients enrolled from the YUKAWA studies into OSLER.

113,excluded,Carbon content and climate variability drive global soil bacterial diversity patterns,"Despite the vital role of microorganisms for ecosystem functioning and human welfare, our understanding of their global diversity and biogeographical patterns lags significantly behind that of plants and animals. We conducted a meta-analysis including similar to 600 soil samples from all continents to evaluate the biogeographical patterns and drivers of bacterial diversity in terrestrial ecosystems at the global scale. Similar to what has been found with plants and animals, the diversity of soil bacteria in the Southern Hemisphere decreased from the equator to Antarctica. However, soil bacteria showed similar levels of diversity across the Northern Hemisphere. The composition of bacterial communities followed dissimilar patterns between hemispheres, as the Southern and Northern Hemispheres were dominated by Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria, respectively. However, Proteobacteria was co-dominant in both hemispheres. Moreover, we found a decrease in soil bacterial diversity with altitude. Climatic features (e.g., high diurnal temperature range and low temperature) were correlated with the lower diversity found at high elevations, but geographical gradients in soil total carbon and species turnover were important drivers of the observed latitudinal patterns. We thus found both parallels and differences in the biogeographical patterns of aboveground vs. soil bacterial diversity. Our findings support previous studies that highlighted soil pH, spatial influence, and organic matter as important drivers of bacterial diversity and composition. Furthermore, our results provide a novel integrative view of how climate and soil factors influence soil bacterial diversity at the global scale, which is critical to improve ecosystem and earth system simulation models and for formulating sustainable ecosystem management and conservation policies.",bacterial composition; biodiversity; diurnal temperature range; global biogeography; soil carbon; terrestrial ecosystems

This study examines the relationship between leucocyte telomere length (LTL), a potential biomarker for biological aging, and selection, optimization, and compensation (SOC) and learning opportunities as strategies involving efficient management and gain of resources at work.MethodsWithin a cross-sectional study, blood samples were drawn from 141 geriatric care professionals to measure LTL by quantitative real-time polymerase-chain reaction. Furthermore, all participants were asked with standardized questionnaires to rate their learning opportunities at work and use of SOC strategies. Analyses were performed by multiple linear regressions.ResultsSOC use, especially compensation, tended to be negatively, and learning opportunities tended to be positively associated with LTL. Furthermore, a significant interaction was found between optimization and learning opportunities, such that LTL and learning opportunities were only positively associated when optimization was high.ConclusionsResources at work were weakly associated with telomere length, which is not unexpected in view of the multiplicity of factors affecting LTL. The results further suggest that a mismatch between SOC and learning opportunities may negatively affect successful aging. They also suggest that more detailed research on biological aging and its relation to resources at work is needed.",Learning opportunities; Selection; optimization; compensation; Telomere length; Resources; Aging

A series of hierarchical regression analyses was performed to determine the percentage of the criterion (mathematics achievement) variance that could be explained by study orientation in mathematics. This investigation was augmented by the further exploration of learners' attributions regarding the causes of their achievement in mathematics. The results emphasised the importance of the set of study orientation variables as predictors of achievement in mathematics for both genders and all three race groups (i.e., black, white and coloured students). Study milieu and problem-solving behaviour appeared to be the most significant individual predictors of mathematics achievement for both genders, and both black and white Grade 9 learners.

116,excluded,A supportive family environment in childhood enhances the level and heritability of sense of coherence in early adulthood,"To analyze the effects of genetic and environmental factors on sense of coherence (SOC) in young adulthood and whether family environment measured in childhood modifies these effects. SOC was measured at 20-27 years of age in 3,193 Finnish twins using the Antonovsky's 13-item short scale. The twins and their parents had rated their emotional family environment independently when the twins were 12 years of age. The data were analyzed using applications of structural linear equation modeling to twin data. Females rated SOC 2.42 points lower than males. Additive genetic factors explained 39 % of the variation of SOC in males and 49 % in females, whereas the rest of the variation was explained by environmental factors unique to each twin individual. For the dimensions of SOC, the highest genetic correlation was found between comprehensibility and manageability (0.90 in males and 0.97 in females). SOC was strongest in the participants who had reported supportive family atmosphere and low relational tensions to parents in childhood. These participants also had higher genetic variance and lower unique environmental variance of SOC when compared to those who reported emotionally more stressful family environment. The results were similar when we used parental rating of family environment. Genetic factors are important for SOC, but genetic influences are much greater in supportive family environments. This emphasizes the importance of childhood home for the development of strong SOC.",
117,excluded,Impact analysis and change propagation in service-oriented enterprises: a systematic review,"Context: The adoption of Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) and Business Process Management (BPM) is fairly recent. The major concern is now shifting towards the maintenance and evolution of service-based business information systems. Moreover, these systems are highly dynamic and frequent changes are anticipated across multiple levels of abstraction. Impact analysis and change propagation are identified as potential research areas in this regard. Objective: The aim of this study is to systematically review extant research on impact analysis and propagation in the BPM and SOA domains. Identifying, categorizing and synthesizing relevant solutions are the main study objectives. Method: Through careful review and screening, we identified 60 studies relevant to 4 research questions. Two classification schemes served to comprehend and analyze the anatomy of existing solutions. BPM is considered at the business level for business operations and processes, while SOA is considered at the service level as deployment architecture. We focused on both horizontal and vertical impacts of changes across multiple abstraction layers. Results: Impact analysis solutions were mainly divided into dependency analysis, traceability analysis and history mining. Dependency analysis is the most frequently adopted technique followed by traceability analysis. Further categorization of dependency analysis indicates that graph-based techniques are extensively used, followed by formal dependency modeling. While considering hierarchical coverage, inter-process and inter-service change analyses have received considerable attention from the research community, whereas bottom-up analysis has been the most neglected research area. The majority of change propagation solutions are top-down and semi-automated. Conclusions: This study concludes with new insight suggestions for future research. Although, the evolution of service-based systems is becoming of grave concern, existing solutions in this field are less mature. Studies on hierarchical change impact are scarce. Complex relationships of services with business processes and semantic dependencies are poorly understood and require more attention from the research community. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

118,excluded,Carbon sequestration and soil fertility of tropical tree plantations and secondary forest established on degraded land,"Much tropical land requires rehabilitation but the capacity of reforestation with plantations or naturally regenerating secondary forests for overcoming soil degradation remains unclear. We hypothesised that desirable effects, including improved soil fertility and carbon sequestration, are achieved to a greater extent in Acacia mangium plantations and secondary forests than in Eucalyptus urophylla plantations. We tested our hypothesis across soil and climate gradients in Vietnam with linear mixed-effect models and other, comparing A. mangium and E. urophylla plantations, secondary forests and pasture. A. mangium plantations and secondary forests showed a positive correlation between biomass production and desirable soils properties including increased soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, and reduced bulk density. All plantations, but not secondary forests, caused increases in soil acidity. Eight-year old A. mangium plantations contained most carbon in biomass+soil, and secondary forests and pastures had similar or higher soil carbon. E. urophylla plantations had the lowest soil carbon status, raising doubt about their sequestration capacity in current 6-8 year rotations. The study demonstrates that appropriate reforestation enhances soil fertility and promotes carbon sequestration on degraded tropical lands and that unmanaged secondary forests are effective at improving soil fertility and sequestering carbon at low cost.",
119,excluded,Components of forest soil co2 efflux estimated from delta c-14 values of soil organic matter,"The partitioning of the total soil CO2 efflux into its two main components: respiration from roots (and root-associated organisms) and microbial respiration (by means of soil organic matter (SOM) and litter decomposition), is a major need in soil carbon dynamics studies in order to understand if a soil is a net sink or source of carbon. The heterotrophic component of the CO2 efflux was estimated for 11 forest sites as the ratio between the carbon stocks of different SOM pools and previously published (Delta C-14 derived) turnover times. The autotrophic component, including root and root-associated respiration, was calculated by subtracting the heterotrophic component from total soil chamber measured CO2 efflux. Results suggested that, on average, 50.4 % of total soil CO2 efflux was derived from the respiration of the living roots, 42.4 % from decomposition of the litter layers and less than 10 % from decomposition of belowground SOM. The Delta C-14 method proved to be an efficient tool by which to partition soil CO2 efflux and quantify the contribution of the different components of soil respiration. However the average calculated heterotrophic respiration was statistically lower compared with two previous studies dealing with soil CO2 efflux partitioning (one performed in the same study area; the other a meta-analysis of soil respiration partitioning). These differences were probably due to the heterogeneity of the SOM fraction and to a sub-optimal choice of the litter sampling period.",

Materials and methods: Burden of CVD was assessed using the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in order to capture complete CV burden including CV mortality. Patients on standard of care (SOC; high-intensity statins) in CPRD were selected based on eligibility criteria of FOURIER, a phase 3 CV outcomes trial of evolocumab, and categorized into four cohorts: high-risk prevalent atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) cohort (n = 1448), acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (n = 602), ischemic stroke (IS) (n = 151), and heart failure (HF) (n = 291) incident cohorts. The value-based price range for evolocumab was assessed using a previously published economic model. The model incorporated CPRD CV event rates and considered CV event reduction rate ratios per 1 mmol/L reduction in low-density lipo-protein- cholesterol (LDL-C) from a meta-analysis of statin trials by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists Collaboration (CTTC), i.e. CTTC relationship. Results: Multiple-event rates of composite CV events (ACS, IS, or coronary revascularization) per 100 patient-years were 12.3 for the high-risk prevalent ASCVD cohort, and 25.7, 13.3, and 23.3, respectively, for incident ACS, IS, and HF cohorts. Approximately one-half (42%) of the high-risk ASCVD patients with a new CV event during follow-up had a subsequent CV event. Combining these real-world event rates and the CTTC relationship in the economic model, the value-based price range (credible interval) under a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/ quality-adjusted life-year gained for evolocumab was $11,990 ($9,341-$14,833) to $16,856 ($12,903-$20,678) in ASCVD patients with baseline LDL-C levels >= 70 mg/dL and >= 100 mg/dL, respectively. Conclusion: Real-world CVD burden is substantial. Using the observed CVD burden in CPRD and the CTTC relationship, the cost-effectiveness analysis showed that, accounting for uncertainties, the expected value-based price for evolocumab is higher than its current annual cost, as long as the payer discount off list price is greater than 20%.",Evolocumab; PCSK9 inhibition; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC); cardiovascular disease (CVD); burden of disease; cost-effectiveness; value-based pricing

A cross-sectional analysis of 229 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or affective disorders was undertaken to test a sequential mediation model assuming that more severe internalized stigma is related to lower self-esteem, which is associated with weaker SOC, which in turn relates to worse QoL. The proposed model was supported by the data. A sequential indirect effect from internalized stigma to QoL via self-esteem and SOC turned out to be significant [beta = -0.06, SE = 0.02; 95% CI (-0.11, -0.03)]. Support was also found for simple mediation models with either self-esteem or SOC as single mediators between internalized stigma and QoL. Self-esteem and SOC are personal resources that should be considered as potential targets of interventions aiming to prevent the harmful consequences of internalized stigma for the QoL of people receiving psychiatric treatment.",Internalized stigma; Quality of life; Self-esteem; Sense of coherence; Mental illness
122,included,Straw incorporation increases crop yield and soil organic carbon sequestration but varies under different natural conditions and farming practices in China: a system analysis,"Loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) from agricultural
soils is a key indicator of soil degradation associated
with reductions in net primary productivity in crop production
systems worldwide. Technically simple and locally appropriate
solutions are required for farmers to increase SOC
and to improve cropland management. In the last 30 years,
straw incorporation (SI) has gradually been implemented
across China in the context of agricultural intensification and
rural livelihood improvement. A meta-analysis of data published
before the end of 2016 was undertaken to investigate
the effects of SI on crop production and SOC sequestration.
The results of 68 experimental studies throughout China
in different edaphic conditions, climate regions and farming
regimes were analyzed. Compared with straw removal (SR),
SI significantly sequestered SOC (0–20 cm depth) at the rate
of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.31–0.40)Mg C ha􀀀1 yr􀀀1, increased crop
grain yield by 13.4% (9.3–18.4 %) and had a conversion efficiency
of the incorporated straw C of 16% 2% across
China. The combined SI at the rate of 3Mg C ha􀀀1 yr􀀀1 with
mineral fertilizer of 200–400 kg Nha􀀀1 yr􀀀1 was demonstrated
to be the best farming practice, where crop yield increased
by 32.7% (17.9–56.4 %) and SOC sequestrated by
the rate of 0.85 (0.54–1.15)Mg Cha􀀀1 yr􀀀1. SI achieved a
higher SOC sequestration rate and crop yield increment when
applied to clay soils under high cropping intensities, and in
areas such as northeast China where the soil is being degraded.
The SOC responses were highest in the initial starting
phase of SI, then subsequently declined and finally became
negligible after 28–62 years. However, crop yield responses
were initially low and then increased, reaching their
highest level at 11–15 years after SI. Overall, our study confirmed
that SI created a positive feedback loop of SOC enhancement
together with increased crop production, and this
is of great practical importance to straw management as agriculture
intensifies both in China and other regions with different
climate conditions.",croplands
123,excluded,Differential responses of carbon-degrading enzyme activities to warming: implications for soil respiration,"Extracellular enzymes catalyze rate-limiting steps in soil organic matter decomposition, and their activities (EEAs) play a key role in determining soil respiration (SR). Both EEAs and SR are highly sensitive to temperature, but their responses to climate warming remain poorly understood. Here, we present a meta-analysis on the response of soil cellulase and ligninase activities and SR to warming, synthesizing data from 56 studies. We found that warming significantly enhanced ligninase activity by 21.4% but had no effect on cellulase activity. Increases in ligninase activity were positively correlated with changes in SR, while no such relationship was found for cellulase. The warming response of ligninase activity was more closely related to the responses of SR than a wide range of environmental and experimental methodological factors. Furthermore, warming effects on ligninase activity increased with experiment duration. These results suggest that soil microorganisms sustain long-term increases in SR with warming by gradually increasing the degradation of the recalcitrant carbon pool.",cellulase activity; decomposition; extracellular enzyme activity; global warming; ligninase activity; recalcitrant carbon pool; soil microorganisms; soil respiration
124,excluded,Pre-career perceptions of gendered work performance: the impact of same-gender referents and work experience on men's evaluation bias,"According to the United States Census Bureau, women's 2016 earnings equated to approximately 80% of men's annual median income (Semega et al. in U.S. Census Bureau, current population reports. Income and poverty in the United States: 2016. U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 2017). This pay gap, while decreasing marginally over time, has remained fairly consistent. Social science research has not sufficiently explained the gap. Research has tended to focus on the existence of the gap or on women's lower expectations. Women's use of same-gender referents has been found to both result in perceptions of wages as more just (Mueller and Wallace in Soc Psychol Q 59:338-349, 1996; Valet in Work Occup 1-26, 2018) as well as in higher job satisfaction (Buchanan in Sociol Focus 41:177-196, 2008. 10.1080/00380237.2008.10571329). This gender paradox of the contented female worker (Crosby in Relative deprivation and working women, Oxford University Press, New York, 1982) is important as it potentially hinders the demand for equal pay and perpetuates the gender gap. Gender biases in work performance evaluations are critical to our understanding of women's lower pay. This article examines both men and women's use of same-gender referents and the impact on perceptions potentially biasing the evaluations of women's work. Using a survey of 488 undergraduate university students from the mid-southern United States, we first compare the salary expectations and work aspirations of women and men and find no gender differences. Next, we investigate how same-gender referent use, particularly for men, impacts work performance assessments using the perceptions of gendered work performance scale. We find men perceive women as inferior performers, with this tendency being stronger for men who use same-gender referents, as well as, for men lacking work experience, while same-gender referent use by women is not associated with gendered performance perceptions.",Referent; Gendered work performance; Equity
125,excluded,Sinks for nitrogen inputs in terrestrial ecosystems: a meta-analysis of N-15 tracer field studies,"Effects of anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition and the ability of terrestrial ecosystems to store carbon (C) depend in part on the amount of N retained in the system and its partitioning among plant and soil pools. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies at 48 sites across four continents that used enriched N-15 isotope tracers in order to synthesize information about total ecosystem N retention (i.e., total ecosystem N-15 recovery in plant and soil pools) across natural systems and N partitioning among ecosystem pools. The greatest recoveries of ecosystem N-15 tracer occurred in shrublands (mean, 89.5%) and wetlands (84.8%) followed by forests (74.9%) and grasslands (51.8%). In the short term (<1 week after N-15 tracer application), total ecosystem N-15 recovery was negatively correlated with fine-root and soil N-15 natural abundance, and organic soil C and N concentration but was positively correlated with mean annual temperature and mineral soil C:N. In the longer term (3-18 months after N-15 tracer application), total ecosystem N-15 retention was negatively correlated with foliar natural-abundance N-15 but was positively correlated with mineral soil C and N concentration and C:N, showing that plant and soil natural-abundance N-15 and soil C:N are good indicators of total ecosystem N retention. Foliar N concentration was not significantly related to ecosystem N-15 tracer recovery, suggesting that plant N status is not a good predictor of total ecosystem N retention. Because the largest ecosystem sinks for N-15 tracer were below ground in forests, shrublands, and grasslands, we conclude that growth enhancement and potential for increased C storage in aboveground biomass from atmospheric N deposition is likely to be modest in these ecosystems. Total ecosystem N-15 recovery decreased with N fertilization, with an apparent threshold fertilization rate of 46 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1) above which most ecosystems showed net losses of applied N-15 tracer in response to N fertilizer addition.",
126,excluded,Treatment of elderly hypertensive patients with epithelial sodium channel inhibitors combined with a thiazide diuretic reduces coronary mortality and sudden cardiac death,"No reduction in either coronary mortality or sudden cardiac death (SCD) has been demonstrated in overviews of randomized trials of treatment of hypertension with diuretics. An overview was conducted of coronary mortality and SCD in randomized controlled antihypertensive trials in which an epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) inhibitor/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combination was used. Secondarily, an analogous overview in which thiazide diuretic was used alone was performed. Randomized trials that used an ENaC inhibitor/HCTZ combination (or, alternatively, thiazide diuretic alone) were identified from previous meta-analyses, searches of PubMed, search of the Cochrane Clinical Trials database, and review of publications that addressed the consequences of treating hypertension. Trials in which participants were randomized to either an ENaC inhibitor combined with a thiazide diuretic (or to a thiazide diuretic alone) or to control treatment for at least I year and in which coronary mortality was reported were included. Numbers of events in individual trials were abstracted independently by two authors. Significant reductions in both coronary mortality and SCD were observed in the overview of trials in which elderly patients received an ENaC inhibitor/HCTZ combination. The odds ratio (OR) for coronary mortality was 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 0.78) and for SCD was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.94). In contrast, an overview of the trials using thiazide diuretics alone showed no significant reductions of either coronary mortality (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.09) or SCD (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.75).

127,excluded,Meta-analysis of genetic and environmental parkinson's disease models reveals a common role of mitochondrial protection pathways,"Both genetic and environmental factors trigger risks of and protection from Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurodegenerative syndrome, but possible inter-relationships between these risk and protection processes were not yet explored. By examining gene expression changes in the brains of mice under multiple treatments that increase or attenuate PD symptoms we detected underlying disease and protection-associated genes and pathways. In search for potential links between these different genes and pathways, we conducted meta-analysis on 131 brain region transcriptomes from mice over-expressing native or mutated alpha-synuclein (SNCA) with or without the protective HSP70 chaperone, or exposed to the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), with or without the protective acetylcholinesterase (AChE-R) variant. All these models showed shared risk-inducible and protection-suppressible transcript modifications. Self-organized map (SOM) classification revealed risk- and protection-associated alterations in nuclear and mitochondrial metal ion-regulated transcripts, respectively; Gene Ontology based analysis validated these pathways. To complement this approach, and identify potential outcome damages, we further searched for shared functional enrichments in the lists of genes detected in young SNCA mutant or in old SNCA mutants and MPTP-exposed mice. This post-hoc functional analysis identified early-onset changes in Parkinsonian, immune and alternative splicing pathways which shifted into late-onset or exposure-associated NFkB-mediated neuro-inflammation. Our study suggests metal ions-mediated cross-talk between nuclear and mitochondrial pathways by both environmental and genetic risk and protective factors involved in Parkinson's disease, which eventually culminates in neuro-inflammation. Together, these findings offer new insights and novel targets for therapeutic interference with the gene-environment interactions underlying sporadic PD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
128,excluded,Optimizing the detection of biliary dysplasia in primary sclerosing cholangitis before liver transplantation,"Background: Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) have increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). We evaluated pre-transplant work-up in PSC patients, to search for the most effective strategy for the detection of biliary dysplasia or early CCA.Methods: Two hundred and twenty five consecutive PSC patients undergoing liver transplantation (LTx) in Sweden between 1999 and 2013 were studied. Patients with CCA or dysplasia in the explanted liver were compared with those with benign histopathology. Measures of test performance were calculated for patients having brush cytology on one endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) occasion, for those having repeated examinations with or without cholangioscopy, and for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Survival after LTx was analyzed.Results: Brush cytology on a single ERCP occasion had moderate sensitivity (57%) and high specificity (94%) for the detection of CCA/high grade dysplasia (HGD) in the explanted liver. The corresponding sensitivity and specificity for FISH were 84% and 90%, respectively. Utilizing repeated ERCP and brush cytology to confirm the initial finding improved sensitivity to 82%. Using single operator cholangioscopy (SOC) for targeted examination at the second ERCP improved sensitivity (100%) and specificity (97%) significantly. Mortality rate in patients with incidentally discovered CCA (n=16) in the explanted liver was significantly higher than in patients with HGD or benign histopathology (HR 16.0; 95% CI, 5.6-45.4; p<.001).Conclusions: Repeated brush cytology especially when combined with targeted examination under SOC guidance is superior to single brush examinations. This strategy improves the detection of malignancy in PSC and is of importance for selection of patients for LTx.",Cholangiocarcinoma; sclerosing cholangitis; liver transplantation
129,excluded,Systemic safety of bevacizumab versus ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration,"Background Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of legal blindness in elderly populations of industrialised countries. Bevacizumab (Avastin (R)) and ranibizumab (Lucentis (R)) are targeted biological drugs (a monoclonal antibody) that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor, an angiogenic cytokine that promotes vascular leakage and growth, thereby preventing its pathological angiogenesis. Ranibizumab is approved for intravitreal use to treat neovascular AMD, while bevacizumab is approved for intravenous use as a cancer therapy. However, due to the biological similarity of the two drugs, bevacizumab is widely used off-label to treat neovascular AMD. Objectives To assess the systemic safety of intravitreal bevacizumab (brand name Avastin (R); Genentech/Roche) compared with intravitreal ranibizumab (brand name Lucentis (R); Novartis/Genentech) in people with neovascular AMD. Primary outcomes were death and All serious systemic adverse events (All SSAEs), the latter as a composite outcome in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice. Secondary outcomes examined specific SSAEs: fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarctions, strokes, arteriothrombotic events, serious infections, and events grouped in some Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities System Organ Classes (MedDRA SOC). We assessed the safety at the longest available follow-up to a maximum of two years. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and other online databases up to 27 March 2014. We also searched abstracts and clinical study presentations at meetings, trial registries, and contacted authors of included studies when we had questions. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) directly comparing intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg) and ranibizumab (0.5 mg) in people with neovascular AMD, regardless of publication status, drug dose, treatment regimen, or follow-up length, and whether the SSAEs of interest were reported in the trial report. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies and assessed the risk of bias for each study. Three authors independently extracted data. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses for the primary and secondary outcomes. We planned a pre-specified analysis to explore deaths and All SSAEs at the one-year follow-up. Main results We included data from nine studies (3665 participants), including six published (2745 participants) and three unpublished (920 participants) RCTs, none supported by industry. Three studies excluded participants at high cardiovascular risk, increasing clinical heterogeneity among studies. The studies were well designed, and we did not downgrade the quality of the evidence for any of the outcomes due to risk of bias. Although the estimated effects of bevacizumab and ranibizumab on our outcomes were similar, we downgraded the quality of the evidence due to imprecision. At the maximum follow-up (one or two years), the estimated risk ratio (RR) of death with bevacizumab compared with ranibizumab was 1.10 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.57, P value = 0.59; eight studies, 3338 participants; moderate quality evidence). Based on the event rates in the studies, this gives a risk of death with ranibizumab of 3.4% and with bevacizumab of 3.7% (95% CI 2.7% to 5.3%). For All SSAEs, the estimated RR was 1.08 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.31, P value = 0.41; nine studies, 3665 participants; low quality evidence). Based on the event rates in the studies, this gives a risk of SSAEs of 22.2% with ranibizumab and with bevacizumab of 24% (95% CI 20% to 29.1%). For the secondary outcomes, we could not detect any difference between bevacizumab and ranibizumab, with the exception of gastrointestinal disorders MedDRA SOC where there was a higher risk with bevacizumab (RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.04 to 3.19, P value = 0.04; six studies, 3190 participants). Pre-specified analyses of deaths and All SSAEs at one-year follow-up did not substantially alter the findings of our review. Fixed-effect analysis for deaths did not substantially alter the findings of our review, but fixed-effect analysis of All SSAEs showed an increased risk for bevacizumab (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.26, P value = 0.04; nine studies, 3665 participants): the meta-analysis was dominated by a single study (weight = 46.9%). The available evidence was sensitive to the exclusion of CATT or unpublished results. For All SSAEs, the exclusion of CATT moved the overall estimate towards no difference (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.25, P value = 0.92), while the exclusion of LUCAS yielded a larger RR, with more SSAEs in the bevacizumab group, largely driven by CATT (RR 1.19; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.34, P value = 0.004). The exclusion of all unpublished studies produced a RR of 1.12 for death (95% CI 0.78 to 1.62, P value = 0.53) and a RR of 1.21 for SSAEs (95% CI 1.06 to 1.37, P value = 0.004), indicating a higher risk of SSAEs in those assigned to bevacizumab than ranibizumab. Authors' conclusions This systematic review of non-industry sponsored RCTs could not determine a difference between intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab for deaths, All SSAEs, or specific subsets of SSAEs in the first two years of treatment, with the exception of gastrointestinal disorders. The current evidence is imprecise and might vary across levels of patient risks, but overall suggests that if a difference exists, it is likely to be small. Health policies for the utilisation of ranibizumab instead of bevacizumab as a routine intervention for neovascular AMD for reasons of systemic safety are not sustained by evidence. The main results and quality of evidence should be verified once all trials are fully published.",
130,included,Role of Nitrogen Fertilization in Sustaining Organic Matter in Cultivated Soils,"Soil organic matter (SOM) is essential for sustaining food production and maintaining ecosystem services and is a vital resource base for storing C and N. The impact of long-term use of synthetic fertilizer N on SOM, however, has been questioned recently. Here we tested the hypothesis that long-term application of N results in a decrease in SOM. We used data from 135 studies of 114 long-term experiments located at 100 sites throughout the world over time scales of decades under a range of land-management and climate regimes to quantify changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON). Published data of a total of 917 and 580 observations for SOC and SON, respectively, from control (unfertilized or zero N) and N-fertilized treatments (synthetic, organic, and combination) were analyzed using the SAS mixed model and by meta-analysis. Results demonstrate declines of 7 to 16% in SOC and 7 to 11% in SON with no N amendments. In soils receiving synthetic fertilizer N, the rate of SOM loss decreased. Th e time-fertilizer response ratio, which is based on changes in the paired comparisons, showed average increases of 8 and 12% for SOC and SON, respectively, following the application of synthetic fertilizer N. Addition of organic matter (i.e., manure) increased SOM, on average, by 37%. When cropping systems fluctuated between flooding and drying, SOM decreased more than in continuous dryland or flooded systems. Flooded rice (Oryza sativa L.) soils show net accumulations of SOC and SON. Th is work shows a general decline in SOM for all long-term sites, with and without synthetic fertilizer N. However, our analysis also demonstrates that in addition to its role in improving crop productivity, synthetic fertilizer N significantly reduces the rate at which SOM is declining in agricultural soils, worldwide.",Agriculture/methods; Carbon/chemistry; Climate; Fertilizers/analysis; Nitrogen/*chemistry; Organic Chemicals/*chemistry; Soil/*chemistry
131,included,Sustaining crop production in China's cropland by crop residue retention: A meta-analysis,"Crop residue retention (RR) is a recommended practice in China and globally. However, comprehensive assessment of changes and mechanisms affecting crop production and soil processes with RR and thus identifying systems of sustainable residues management are not widely studied. A national meta-analysis was conducted to assess changes in 24 indicators (related to soil quality, soil nutrients, crop yield, and environmental impacts) along with their relationships under RR through 4,910 comparisons from 278 publications across China's croplands. Positively, RR significantly increased crop yield (7.8%), soil organic carbon (SOC) pool (12.3% to 36.8%), soil nutrient reserves (1.9% to 15.2%), soil temperature (6.7%), and water contents (5.9%) and improved soil structure when compared with residue removal (P < .05). Negatively, RR may increase soil acidification and significantly increase emissions of greenhouse gases (by 31.7%, 130.9%, and 12.2% for CO2, CH4, and N2O). Nonetheless, the negative effects can be alleviated, and the positive effects can be strengthened by adopting RR in conjunction with appropriate crops, specific farming practices, and avoiding more than 10 years of consecutive use. The results indicated that a higher decomposition of native and newly added organic matters, induced by RR and attendant changes in soil physical properties, could enhance the dynamics of SOC, microbial biomass, soil nutrients, and the final increase in crop yield and greenhouse gases emissions. Thus, the sustainability of RR-based system could be enhanced by a careful choice and adoption of integrated farming practices. Proper RR management strategies could offer a climate-smart solution to ensure food security and sustain soil productivity.",croplands
132,excluded,Creating carbon offsets in agriculture through no-till cultivation: A meta-analysis of costs and carbon benefits,"Carbon terrestrial sinks are often seen as a low-cost alternative to fuel switching and reduced fossil fuel use for lowering atmospheric CO2. To determine whether this is true for agriculture, one meta-regression analysis (52 studies, 536 observations) examines the costs of switching from conventional tillage to no-till, while another (51 studies, 374 observations) compares carbon accumulation under the two practices. Costs per ton of carbon uptake are determined by combining the two results. The viability of agricultural carbon sinks is found to vary by region and crop, with no-till representing a low-cost option in some regions (costs of less than $10 per tC), but a high-cost option in others (costs of 100-$400 per tC). A particularly important finding is that no-till cultivation may store no carbon at all if measurements are taken at sufficient depth. In some circumstances no-till cultivation may yield a ""triple dividend"" of carbon storage, increased returns and reduced soil erosion, but in many others creating carbon offset credits in agricultural soils is not cost effective because reduced tillage practices store little or no carbon.",

To determine whether telmisartan improves metabolic parameters in metabolic syndrome, we perform the first meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through September 2012 using PubMed and OVID. Eligible studies were RCTs of telmisartan therapy enrolling individuals with metabolic syndrome and reporting metabolic parameters as outcomes. Of 31 potentially relevant articles screened initially, 10 reports of RCTs, enrolling a total of 546 patients with metabolic syndrome, were identified and included. Pooled analysis suggested significant reductions in % changes of fasting glucose (standardized mean difference, -0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.96 to -0.06; P =.03), insulin (-0.23; 95% CI, -0.40 to -0.06; P =.008), glycosylated hemoglobin (-0.26; 95% CI, -0.44 to -0.08; P =.005), and homeostasis model assessment index (-0.22; 95% CI -0.39 to -0.05; P =.01); and a significant increase in % changes of adiponectin (0.75; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.09; P <.0001) among patients with metabolic syndrome randomized to telmisartan versus control therapy.

134,included,Verification of the biomass transfer hypothesis under moderate grazing across the Tibetan plateau: a meta-analysis,"Aim We aimed to explore the general response patterns of plant biomass allocation to grazing disturbance and to test two important hypotheses, optimal partitioning and isometric allocation, for explaining potential mechanisms by which grazing controls biomass distribution in an alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau. Methods We identified 57 relevant papers about grazing on the Tibetan Plateau, from which 366 data sets suitable for the meta-analysis were extracted. Effect sizes were assessed by computing natural log-converted response ratios of response variables. Percentage change relative to control was used for each estimate of grazing effects. Results The aboveground biomass, soil water content (SWC), soil organic carbon, soil total nitrogen, and soil total phosphorus significantly decreased with increased grazing intensities, while plant species richness (SR), soil bulk density (SBD) and the ratio of root to shoot exhibited the opposite tendency. Belowground biomass (BGB) showed no significant differences under light and high grazing intensities while apparently increased under moderate grazing intensity (MG) that verifies the biomass transfer hypothesis. BGB was positively related to SBD and SR but was negatively associated with SWC. Conclusions The biomass transfer in MG supports the optimal partitioning hypothesis that plants partition biomass among various organs to maximize growth rate responding to environmental stress. The findings suggest that the primary mechanisms leading to the enhancement of BGB in MG are compensatory growth of individual plants, a dwarfing tendency within the plant community, a significant increase in species richness, and changes in soil microbial communities resulting from grazing.",Alpine grassland; Arid region; Grazing; Meta-analysis; Biomass transfer hypothesis
135,excluded,Responses of soil fungal diversity and community composition to long-term fertilization: field experiment in an acidic ultisol and literature synthesis,"Fungal communities play a critical role in regulating soil nutrient cycling and plant growth. However, the effects of long-term mineral and organic fertilization on fungal communities in Ultisols remain largely unknown. Soil samples from a 27-year fertilization experiment were used to investigate fungal communities through high-throughput sequencing along with literature data. The study involved seven treatments: no fertilization (Control), mineral NPK fertilizer (NPK), NPK fertilizer plus lime (NPK + Lime), NPK fertilizer plus peanut straw (NPK + PeanStraw), NPK fertilizer plus rice straw (NPK + RiceStraw), NPK fertilizer plus radish residue (NPK + RadResidue), and NPK fertilizer plus pig manure (NPK + PigManure). Long-term amendment of mineral and organic fertilizers did not alter fungal diversity in strong acidic Ultisols (original soil pH = 4.96). Metaanalysis of 60 global measurements in literature showed that fertilizer-induced decreases in fungal diversity (Hedge's d = - 0.36; p < 0.05) occurred mainly in soils with initial pH > 6 rather than < 6, potentially due to the decrease in soil pH in fertilized soils, with mineral fertilizers having stronger effects than organic amendments. Ascomycota was the dominant phylum in all treatments, accounting for 75-90% of the total sequences, followed by Basidiomycota (5.9-11%), which are consistent with data from literature. Application of NPK + Lime and NPK + PigManure shifted fungal community structure by increasing relative abundance of Hypocreales and Pezizales, respectively, compared with the Control, while amendment with NPK alone or in combination with crop residues did not. Soil organic carbon, effective diffusion coefficient of oxygen, and pH were the three most critical determinants of fungal community structure. Overall, our results suggest that fungal community structure rather than fungal diversity responded to the application of NPK + Lime or NPK + PigManure but not NPK + plant residues in WA Ultisols, and lack of response in fungal diversity to fertilization was potentially due to the particularly low soil pH in test soils.",Fungi; Diversity; Community composition; Long-term fertilization; Ultisols
136,excluded,Enhancing agroecosystem productivity with woody perennials in semi-arid west africa. A meta-analysis,"Soil degradation in semi-arid West Africa can be reversed through an intensified application of organic matter, especially on coarse soils. Woody perennials have been promoted in the region to secure organic matter sources and improve soil productive capacity, yet the mechanisms by which perennials provide benefits to soils and crops remain poorly understood, and no effective, generalizable agronomic recommendations exist. Here, we reviewed the effects of trees and shrubs on soil properties and on crop yields in semi-arid West Africa (<1000mmyear(-1)). Specific objectives of this meta-analysis were to (i) describe and (ii) quantify the effects of the presence of woody perennials and of ramial wood amendments on crop productivity and soil characteristics, and (iii) identify general recommendations on the integration of perennials with crops. An iterative keyword search was conducted to gather relevant literature. The search string consisted of four parts: source, practice, responses, and countries of interest. In total, 26 references on agroforestry parklands and 21 on woody amendments were included in the meta-database (314 entries, 155 for parklands, and 159 for ramial wood). We show that (1) the presence of shrubs and trees on agricultural fields had an overall positive but variable effect on soil total C (i.e. +20 to 75%); (2) millet and sorghum yields were often higher in the presence of shrubs (-25 to +120%); (3) more variability was observed in the presence of trees (-100 to +200%); and (4) the use of shrub- and tree-based ramial wood resulted in equal or higher cereal yields as compared to the control (-30 to +100%). Upscaling the use of biodiversity-driven processes in farming systems of West Africa may provide benefits to overall ecosystems, but species' choice and trade-offs perceived at the farm level, including labour management and low ramial wood availability, should be addressed through future research.",Agroforestry; Mulch; Sahel; Shrub-crop associations; Woody amendments
137,excluded,Cost-effectiveness analysis of standalone trabecular micro-bypass stents in patients with mild-to-moderate open-angle glaucoma in canada,"Objectives: To estimate the cost-utility of two trabecular micro-bypass stents (TBS) implantation vs standard of care (SOC) in patients with mild-to-moderate open-angle glaucoma (OAG) in the Canadian healthcare setting. Methods: The deterioration in visual field (VF) defect over a 15-year time horizon was tracked using a Markov model with Hodapp-Parrish-Anderson stages of glaucoma (mild, moderate, advanced, severe/blind) and death as health states. Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials were conducted to estimate the pooled reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) and medication use due to TBS and SOC. The rate of decline in VF loss was adjusted by the extent of IOP reduction to estimate transition probabilities. Healthcare resource utilization, unit costs (2017 CAD), and progression-related utility scores were obtained by literature review, and medication costs with wastage were obtained from IMS Brogan PharmaStat. The impact of parameter and methodological uncertainty on costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was examined using probabilistic and 1-way sensitivity analyses. Results: The meta-analysis showed an additional reduction of 1.13 medications/patient and an additional decrease in IOP of -1.10 mmHg at 36 months favoring TBS. TBS strongly dominated medication alone, due to higher improvement in quality-of-life (0.068 QALYs), fewer blind eyes (-0.0031), and a decrease in total healthcare costs of C$2,908.3 per patient over the time horizon (C$9,394.1 TBS vs C$12,302.4 medication alone). Sensitivity analyses showed that results were robust to the uncertainties in model inputs and assumptions. Time-to-dominance was 44 months (3.7 years). Conclusions: The TBS procedure was cost-effective over SOC in a 15-year time horizon, with quality-of-life gains.",Microinvasive glaucoma surgery; cost-effectiveness; trabecular micro-bypass; iStent; glaucoma; glaucoma drainage implants; trabecular meshwork
138,included,Variability of above-ground litter inputs alters soil physicochemical and biological processes: a meta-analysis of litterfall-manipulation experiments,"Global change has been shown to alter the amount of above-ground litter inputs to soil greatly, which could cause substantial cascading effects on below-ground biogeochemical cycling. Despite extensive study, there is uncertainty about how changes in above-ground litter inputs affect soil carbon and nutrient turnover and transformation. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis on 70 litter-manipulation experiments in order to assess how changes in above-ground litter inputs alter soil physicochemical properties, carbon dynamics and nutrient cycles. Our results demonstrated that litter removal decreased soil respiration by 34%, microbial biomass carbon in the mineral soil by 39% and total carbon in the mineral soil by 10%, whereas litter addition increased them by 31, 26 and 10%, respectively. This suggests that greater litter inputs increase the soil carbon sink despite higher rates of carbon release and transformation. Total nitrogen and extractable inorganic nitrogen in the mineral soil decreased by 17 and 30%, respectively, under litter removal, but were not altered by litter addition. Overall, litter manipulation had a significant impact upon soil temperature and moisture, but not soil pH; litter inputs were more crucial in buffering soil temperature and moisture fluctuations in grassland than in forest. Compared to other ecosystems, tropical and subtropical forests were more sensitive to variation in litter inputs, as altered litter inputs affected the turnover and accumulation of soil carbon and nutrients more substantially over a shorter time period. Our study demonstrates that although the magnitude of responses differed greatly among ecosystems, the direction of the responses was very similar across different ecosystems. Interactions between plant productivity and below-ground biogeochemical cycling need to be taken into account to predict ecosystem responses to environmental change.",aboveground biomass; carbon cycle; experimental study; global change; grassland; litter; litterfall; meta-analysis; physicochemical property; soil carbon; soil nutrient
139,included,Meta-analysis of high-latitude nitrogen-addition and warming studies implies ecological mechanisms overlooked by land models,"Accurate representation of ecosystem processes in land models is crucial for reducing predictive uncertainty in energy and greenhouse gas feedbacks with the climate. Here we describe an observational and modeling meta-analysis approach to benchmark land models, and apply the method to the land model CLM4.5 with two versions of belowground biogeochemistry. We focused our analysis on the aboveground and belowground responses to warming and nitrogen addition in high-latitude ecosystems, and identified absent or poorly parameterized mechanisms in CLM4.5. While the two model versions predicted similar soil carbon stock trajectories following both warming and nitrogen addition, other predicted variables (e.g., belowground respiration) differed from observations in both magnitude and direction, indicating that CLM4.5 has inadequate underlying mechanisms for representing high-latitude ecosystems. On the basis of observational synthesis, we attribute the model-observation differences to missing representations of microbial dynamics, aboveground and belowground coupling, and nutrient cycling, and we use the observational meta-analysis to discuss potential approaches to improving the current models. However, we also urge caution concerning the selection of data sets and experiments for meta-analysis. For example, the concentrations of nitrogen applied in the synthesized field experiments (average = 72 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) are many times higher than projected soil nitrogen concentrations (from nitrogen deposition and release during mineralization), which precludes a rigorous evaluation of the model responses to likely nitrogen perturbations. Overall, we demonstrate that elucidating ecological mechanisms via meta-analysis can identify deficiencies in ecosystem models and empirical experiments.",biogeochemistry; data set; ecosystem modeling; latitude; meta-analysis; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; warming

In this study, 204 publications (733 observations) were analyzed, focusing on the effects of vegetation restoration on soil organic carbon (SOC) in China. The results showed that SOC was increased by 45.33%, 24.43%, 30.29% and 27.98% at soil depths of 0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, 40-60 cm and > 60 cm after vegetation restoration, respectively. Restoration from both cropland and non-cropland increased the SOC content. The conversion of non-cropland was more efficient in SOC accumulation than the conversion of cropland did, especially in > 40 cm layers. In addition, the conversion to planted forest led to greater SOC accumulation than that to other land use did. Conversion period and initial SOC content extended more influence on soil C accumulation as the main factors after vegetation restoration than temperature and precipitation did. The SOC content significantly increased with restoration period after long-term vegetation restoration (> 40 yr), indicating a large potential for further accumulation of carbon in the soil, which could mitigate climate change in the near future.",soil carbon content; vegetation restoration; land-use change; conversion period; restoration approach; China
142,excluded,Budget impact of incorporating one instillation of hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride blue-light cytoscopy in transurethral bladder tumour resection for patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer in sweden,"Objectives To explore the cost impact on Swedish healthcare of incorporating one instillation of hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL) blue-light cystoscopy into transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) in patients with suspected new or recurrent non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Materials and Methods A decision tree model was built based on European Association of Urology guidelines for the treatment and management of NMIBC. Input data were compiled from two recent studies comparing recurrence rates of bladder cancer in patients undergoing TURBT with either the current standard of care (SOC) of white-light cystoscopy, or with the SOC and HAL blue-light cystoscopy. Using these published data with clinical cost data for surgical and outpatient procedures and pharmaceutical costs, the model reported on the clinical and economic differences associated with the two treatment options. Results This model demonstrates the significant clinical benefits likely to be observed through the incorporation of HAL blue-light cystoscopy for TURBT in terms of reductions in recurrences of bladder cancer. Analysis of economic outputs of the model found that the use of one instillation of HAL for TURBT in all Swedish patients with NMIBC is likely to be cost-neutral or cost-saving over 5 years relative to the current SOC of white-light cystoscopy. Conclusions The results of this analysis provide additional health economic rationale for the incorporation of a single instillation of HAL blue-light cystoscopy for TURBT in the treatment of patients with NMIBC in Sweden.",hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride; Sweden; bladder cancer; budget impact; transurethral resection

Methods: Adult patients with continuous enrollment in a health plan with medical and pharmacy benefits for >= 12 months before and >= 3 months after an inpatient diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) between October 1, 2011, and June 30, 2015, and a prescription claim for an anticoagulant during the index hospitalization, were included. SOC drugs were low-molecular weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, and warfarin. Propensity score matching was used in comparing PE related outcomes (recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and death), hospital-acquired complications (HACs), health care resource utilization, and costs among patients receiving SOC versus rivaroxaban. We defined net clinical benefit as 1 minus the combined rate of PE-related outcomes and HACs. Findings: Among 6746 patients with PE, 208 received rivaroxaban, 4641 received SOC and 1897 received other anticoagulants. Most (95%) were male; 22% were black. After 1:3 propensity score matching, there were 203 rivaroxaban and 609 SOC patients. During the 90-day follow-up, rivaroxaban users had similar rates of PE-related outcomes, but fewer had experienced at least 1 HAC (10.3% vs 15.9%; P = 0.0506), resulting in better net clinical benefit (82.8% vs 71.1%; P = 0.001). Rivaroxaban users had fewer outpatient visits per patient (17.0 vs 19.9; P = 0.0005), a similar rehospitalization rate (0.2 vs 0.3; P = 0.084), lesser inpatient costs (US $3501 vs $6189; P < 0.0001), lesser inpatient costs and lesser total costs ($10,545 vs $14,192; P = 0.0002). When the sample was limited to patients with low-risk PE, we found similar patterns. (C) 2017 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

144,included,Faster turnover of new soil carbon inputs under increased atmospheric CO2,"Rising levels of atmospheric CO2 frequently stimulate plant inputs to soil, but the consequences of these changes for soil carbon (C) dynamics are poorly understood. Plant-derived inputs can accumulate in the soil and become part of the soil C pool (""new soil C""), or accelerate losses of pre-existing (""old"") soil C. The dynamics of the new and old pools will likely differ and alter the long-term fate of soil C, but these separate pools, which can be distinguished through isotopic labeling, have not been considered in past syntheses. Using meta-analysis, we found that while elevated CO2 (ranging from 550 to 800 parts per million by volume) stimulates the accumulation of new soil C in the short term (<1 year), these effects do not persist in the longer term (1-4 years). Elevated CO2 does not affect the decomposition or the size of the old soil C pool over either temporal scale. Our results are inconsistent with predictions of conventional soil C models and suggest that elevated CO2 might increase turnover rates of new soil C. Because increased turnover rates of new soil C limit the potential for additional soil C sequestration, the capacity of land ecosystems to slow the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations may be smaller than previously assumed.",isotopes; meta-analysis; respiration; roots; soil carbon; turnover
145,excluded,"Smooth brome invasion increases rare soil bacterial species prevalence, bacterial species richness and evenness","Plant and soil communities are tightly linked, but the mechanisms by which the invasion of an exotic plant and the resulting shifts in plant diversity and productivity influence soil bacterial community structure remain poorly understood. We investigated the effects of invasive smooth brome (Bromus inermis) on grassland soil bacterial community structure using massively parallel sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to determine bacterial community richness, evenness, composition and beta diversity (UniFrac indices) of soils collected along a gradient of smooth brome abundance. We evaluated several hypotheses including: (a) that the declines in native plant diversity associated with smooth brome invasion would cause declines in bacterial community diversity and (b) that mechanisms driving smooth brome effects on bacterial community structure involved altered soil edaphic properties rather than preferential invasion in areas of high soil nitrogen and distinct soil microbial communities. Smooth brome invasion led to increased soil nitrogen, soil carbon and root biomass. Bacterial evenness and bacterial richness increased with increasing smooth brome cover, while bacterial beta diversity declined. We found no evidence of a dominant direct link between the alteration of soil edaphic properties by brome and the changes in the soil bacterial community. Rather, the main controls on the soil bacterial community were direct effects of pH and smooth brome that could not be linked to the edaphic changes. The most important effect of brome on the bacterial community was the selective suppression of dominant bacterial species, which allowed rarer bacteria to increase in relative abundance.Synthesis. Here, we show that plant community composition influences bacterial community structure at a very fine scale, but that these changes are not due to altered soil total nitrogen or carbon content. The dominant direct effect of smooth brome invasion on soil communities suggests non-edaphic, that is inter- and intratrophic, interactions among smooth brome and non-bacterial components of the soil ecosystem are key drivers of soil community structure.",
146,excluded,Meta-analysis of transcriptome reveals let-7b as an unfavorable prognostic biomarker and predicts molecular and clinical subclasses in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma,"High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HG-SOC) is a heterogeneous, poorly classified, lethal disease that frequently exhibits altered expressions of microRNAs. Let-7 family members are often reported as tumor suppressors; nonetheless, clinicopathological functions and prognostic values of individual let-7 family members have not been addressed in HG-SOC. In our work, we performed an integrative study to investigate the potential roles, clinicopathological functions and prognostic values of let-7 miRNA family in HG-SOC. Using microarray and clinical data of 1,170 HG-SOC patients, we developed novel survival prediction and system biology methods to analyze prognostic values and functional associations of let-7 miRNAs with global transcriptome and clinicopathological factors. We demonstrated that individual let-7 members exhibit diverse evolutionary history and distinct regulatory characteristics. Statistical tests and network analysis suggest that let-7b could act as a global synergistic interactor and master regulator controlling hundreds of protein-coding genes. The elevated expression of let-7b is associated with poor survival rates, which suggests an unfavorable role of let-7b in treatment response for HG-SOC patients. A novel let-7b-defined 36-gene prognostic survival signature outperforms many clinicopathological parameters, and stratifies HG-SOC patients into three high-confidence, reproducible, clinical subclasses: low-, intermediate- and high-risk, with 5-year overall survival rates of 56-71%, 12-29% and 0-10%, respectively. Furthermore, the high-risk and low-risk subclasses exhibit strong mesenchymal and proliferative tumor phenotypes concordant with resistance and sensitivity to primary chemotherapy. Our results have led to identification of promising prognostic markers of HG-SOC, which could provide a rationale for genetic-based stratification of patients and optimization of treatment regimes.",
147,excluded,Sources of variability in greenhouse gas and energy balances for biofuel production: a systematic review,"Across the energy sector, alternatives to fossil fuels are being developed, in response to the dual drivers of climate change and energy security. For transport, biofuels have the greatest potential to replace fossil fuels in the short-to medium term. However, the ecological benefits of biofuels and the role that their deployment can play in mitigating climate change are being called into question. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a widely used approach that enables the energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of biofuel production to be calculated. Concerns have nevertheless been raised that published data show widely varying and sometimes contradictory results. This review describes a systematic review of GHG emissions and energy balance data from 44 LCA studies of first- and second-generation biofuels. The information collated was used to identify the dominant sources of GHG emissions and energy requirements in biofuel production and the key sources of variability in published LCA data. Our analysis revealed three distinct sources of variation: (1) 'real' variability in parameters e.g. cultivation; (2) 'methodological' variability due to the implementation of the LCA method; and (3) 'uncertainty' due to parameters rarely included and poorly quantified. There is global interest in developing a sustainability assessment protocol for biofuels. Confidence in the results of such an assessment can only be assured if these areas of uncertainty and variability are addressed. A more defined methodology is necessary in order to allow effective and accurate comparison of results. It is also essential that areas of uncertainty such as impacts on soil carbon stocks and fluxes are included in LCA assessments, and that further research is conducted to enable a robust calculation of impacts under different land-use change scenarios. Without the inclusion of these parameters, we cannot be certain that biofuels are really delivering GHG savings compared with fossil fuels.",

DESIGN Systematic review. SETTING ED. PARTICIPANTS Physicians, nurses, and medical residents working in the ED. METHODS AND MEASUREMENT Five major biomedical databases were searched for (quasi) experimental studies, published between 1990 and April 2018, evaluating geriatric education programs for ED professionals. Data were synthesized around study quality, learning participants, teaching content and methods, and Kirkpatrick learning outcomes. RESULTS Nine before-after studies were included. Learners were mostly ED residents and, to a smaller extent, ED nurses and physicians. Study quality was moderate, with the lowest scores on sampling and instrument validity. Programs varied from a 1-day workshop to a 2-year curriculum, mostly combining didactic lectures with active and experiential learning formats. Topics commonly addressed included managing: geriatric syndromes, trauma and falls, medication, atypical presentations, and care transitions. Statistically significant improvements were mostly found in learners' knowledge acquisition (six studies). Significant improvements were also found in single studies on: self-reported geriatric screening, documentation of geriatric care, and appropriate urinary catheter placement. Factors promoting program implementation included: solving competing educational demands and busy work schedules, embedding the program in preexisting curricula, and close collaboration between emergency and geriatric medicine faculties. CONCLUSIONS Various geriatric education programs improve the geriatric knowledge of ED professionals and seem to positively impact their clinical practice. However, more program evaluations with larger study samples, and use of valid and reliable outcome measures, are needed to provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of such programs.

149,included,A meta-analysis of the effects of experimental warming on soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics on the Tibetan Plateau,"Alpine ecosystems at high altitudes and latitudes are notably sensitive to climatic warming and the Tibetan Plateau is a widely distributed alpine ecosystem. The magnitude of climatic warming on the Tibetan Plateau is expected to be considerably greater than the global average. However, a synthesis of the experimental warming soil carbon and nitrogen data is still lacking and whether forest soils are more sensitive to warming than grassland soils remains unclear. In this study, we used a meta-analysis approach to synthesise 196 observations from 25 published studies on the Tibetan Plateau. Warming significantly increased microbial biomass carbon (MBC) by 14.3% (95% CI: 2.9-24.6%), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) by 20.1% (95% CI: 2.0-45.1%), net nitrogen mineralization by 49.2% (95% CI: 38.1-62.3%) and net nitrification by 56.0% (95% CI: 51.4-66.1%), but did not significantly affect soil carbon (95% CI: -13.9 to 2.7%) or nitrogen (95% CI: -12.4 to 2.6%). The mean annual air temperature was negatively correlated with the warming effects on MBC and MBN. Grasslands exhibited significant MBC and MBN responses to warming. Specifically, soil microbial biomass was more responsive to warming in colder environments. Moreover, forest soils are not always more sensitive to warming than grassland soils as previous studies have suggested. These findings indicate that clarifying the effect of warming on alpine soils need consider ecosystem types and their local climate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

150,included,Temporal dynamics of soil organic carbon after land-use change in the temperate zone - carbon response functions as a model approach,"Abstract Land-use change (LUC) is a major driving factor for the balance of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the global carbon cycle. The temporal dynamic of SOC after LUC is especially important in temperate systems with a long reaction time. On the basis of 95 compiled studies covering 322 sites in the temperate zone, carbon response functions (CRFs) were derived to model the temporal dynamic of SOC after five different LUC types (mean soil depth of 30±6 cm). Grassland establishment caused a long lasting carbon sink with a relative stock change of 128±23% and afforestation on former cropland a sink of 116±54%, 100 years after LUC (mean±95% confidence interval). No new equilibrium was reached within 120 years. In contrast, there was no SOC sink following afforestation of grasslands and 75% of all observations showed SOC losses, even after 100 years. Only in the forest floor, there was carbon accumulation of 0.38±0.04 Mg ha−1 yr−1 in afforestations adding up to 38±4 Mg ha−1 labile carbon after 100 years. Carbon loss after deforestation (−32±20%) and grassland conversion to cropland (−36±5%), was rapid with a new SOC equilibrium being reached after 23 and 17 years, respectively. The change rate of SOC increased with temperature and precipitation but decreased with soil depth and clay content. Subsoil SOC changes followed the trend of the topsoil SOC changes but were smaller (25±5% of the total SOC changes) and with a high uncertainty due to a limited number of datasets. As a simple and robust model approach, the developed CRFs provide an easily applicable tool to estimate SOC stock changes after LUC to improve greenhouse gas reporting in the framework of UNFCCC.",carbon response functions; land-use change; soil organic carbon; temperate zone; temporal dynamic

DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING: Medline search of the peer-reviewed literature from January 1, 2006, to October 8, 2010. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare beneficiaries who obtained drug insurance from the Part D program. MEASUREMENTS: The review evaluated changes in the use of specific drugs or drug classes after implementation of Part D, as described in original, peer-reviewed articles. RESULTS: Nineteen articles met inclusion criteria. Part D's implementation was associated with greater use of essential medications such as clopidogrel and statins, especially in beneficiaries who had been previously uninsured, but increases in inappropriate antibiotic use for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections and increases in claims for the often overused proton pump inhibitor drug class were also observed. In the Part D transition period, dually eligible beneficiaries' drug use remained largely unchanged. When beneficiary cost sharing increased in the coverage gap, use of essential and overused medications declined. CONCLUSION: Increasing drug coverage led to greater use of underused essential medications and inappropriate, or overused, medications under Medicare Part D. Despite efforts to have it do so, the Part D benefit did not sufficiently discriminate between essential and nonessential medication use. J Am Geriatr Soc 59:1922-1933, 2011.",
152,included,Forest Overstory Effect on Soil Organic Carbon Storage: A Meta-analysis,"A meta-analysis using 77 studies from 28 countries was performed to assess the effect of hardwood vs. conifer overstory on soil organic C (SOC) storage in forest floor (FF), mineral soil, and whole soil (FF + mineral soil). Overall, FF stocks were 38% higher under conifers, mineral SOC stocks were similar, and whole soil SOC was 14% higher under conifers. An analysis with six of the seven most reported tree genera reaffirmed higher FF and whole soil C stocks under conifer stands. Analysis with all seven of the genera showed more pronounced variability in mineral SOC results compared with the overall results. Eucalyptus was the only hardwood that stored significantly (17%) more SOC in the mineral soil than adjacent conifers. Picea was the only conifer that stored significantly (7%) more SOC in the mineral soil than hardwoods. Differences in FF SOC stocks had a limited predictive power in explaining the variability of mineral SOC stock differences, suggesting that they are not very closely linked with regard to SOC storage. Only when comparing FF SOC stocks among genera did precipitation, age difference, soil texture, and previous land use moderate SOC storage differences between conifers and hardwoods. In other cases, neither climate nor soil variables could explain differences between SOC stocks.

153,excluded,End-of-life care for people with dementia from ethnic minority groups: a systematic review,"A systematic review of the literature was conducted to examine the relationship between ethnic minority status and provision of end-of-life care for people with dementia. It included all empirical research on people with dementia or severe cognitive impairment or their caregivers and with ethnic minority people as a subgroup in examining an outcome involving end-of-life care processes or attitudes toward end-of-life care. Two authors independently rated quality of included studies; 20 studies met eligibility criteria and were included in the review: 19 quantitative and one qualitative. All articles were based in the United States, with African American, Hispanic, and Asian groups being the ethnic minorities. Artificial nutrition and other life-sustaining treatments were more frequent and decisions to withhold treatment less common in African American and Asian groups. The qualitative evidence, albeit limited, found that attitudes toward end-of-life care were more similar than different between different ethnic groups. Differences in hospice usage patterns were less consistent and potentially influenced by factors such as study setting and dementia severity. Caregivers' experiences differed between ethnic groups, whereas levels of strain experienced were similar. Disparities in end-of-life care for people with dementia from ethnic minority groups appear to exist and may be due to the double disadvantage of dementia and ethnic minority status. Further research is needed in other western multicultural countries, with a focus on prospective qualitative studies to understand the underlying reasons for these differences, not just their occurrence.

154,included,A meta-analysis and critical evaluation of influencing factors on soil carbon priming following biochar amendment,"Previous studies have found biochar-induced effects on native soil organic carbon (NSOC) decomposition, with a range of positive, negative and no priming reported. However, many uncertainties still exist regarding which parameters drive the amplitude and the direction of the biochar priming. We conducted a quantitative analysis of 1170 groups of data from 27 incubation studies using boosted regression trees (BRTs). BRT is a machine learning method combining regression trees and a boosting algorithm, which can effectively partition independent influences of various factors on the target variable in the complex ecological processes. The BRT model explained a total of 72.4% of the variation in soil carbon (C) priming following biochar amendment, in which incubation conditions (36.5%) and biochar properties (33.7%) explained a larger proportion than soil properties (29.8%). The predictors that substantially accounted for the explained variation included incubation time (27.1%) and soil moisture (5.0%), biochar C/N ratio (6.2%), nitrogen content (5.5%), pyrolysis time during biochar production (5.1%), biochar pH (4.5%), soil C content (5.2%), sand (4.7%) and clay content (4.1%). In contrast, other incubation conditions (temperature, biochar dose, whether nutrient was added), biochar properties (biochar C, feedstock type, ash content, pyrolysis temperature, whether biochar was activated) and soil properties (nitrogen content, silt content, C/N ratio, pH, land use type) had small contribution (each < 4%). Positive priming occurred within the first 2 years of incubations, with a change to negative priming afterwards. The priming was negative for low N biochar or in high-moisture soils but positive on their reverse sides. The size of negative priming increased with rising biochar C/N ratio, pyrolysis time and soil clay content, but deceased with soil C/N ratio. We determine the critical drivers for biochar effect on native soil organic C cycling, which can help us to better predict soil C sequestration following biochar amendment.",Boosted regression tree; Incubation time; Native soil organic matter; Priming effect; Pyrogenic organic matter; Soil respiration
155,excluded,"Short-term effects of harvesting on carbon storage of boreal larix gmelinii-carex schmidtii forested wetlands in daxing'anling, northeast china","Forested wetlands are recognized as long-term terrestrial C sinks, so they are very important in global C accounting. Daxing'anling is the main area of Chinese forested wetlands, however, effects of harvesting on ecosystem C storage for boreal forested wetlands are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term effects of selective harvest on ecosystem C storage and C sequestration for Larix gmelinii-Carex schmidtii forested wetlands in Daxing'anling, northeast China, by measuring and comparing changes in its total ecosystem C storage (biomass, litter, and soil C pools) and annual C sequestration under four harvest treatments (0.0% - uncut, 25% - low, 35% - moderate and 50% - high of total volume) after 5 years, so as to provide references for managing wetland resources. We found that: (1) the vegetation C storage of harvested plots decreased significantly by 15.5-38.6% of that 99.61 t C ha(-1) in the uncut stand and showed a decreasing trend with increasing harvest intensity; (2) low intensity harvest increased the soil C storage by 19.4%, however, both moderate- and high-intensity harvest caused significant reductions (30.1-48.5%) relative to 174.93 t C ha(-1) in the uncut stand; (3) low intensity harvest led to a mild increase in the total ecosystem C storage while moderate- and high-intensity harvest resulted in significant reductions (33.2-41.6%) compared with the uncut stand (274.54 t C ha(-1)); (4) significantly greater total NPP (69.1-83.2%) and annual C sequestration (52.0-78.7%) were in the low- and moderate-intensity harvest stands compared to the high intensity harvest and uncut stands (8.28 t ha(-1) yr(-1), 5.08 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) and 6.48 t ha(-1) yr(-1), 3.52 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Finally, it appears that low intensity harvest may not only be capable of sustaining the ecosystem C sink for this forested wetland type, but restore its C sequestration capacity more efficiently.

156,excluded,Greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield in no-tillage systems: A meta- analysis,"No-tillage (NT) has been touted as one of several climate-smart agriculture (CSA) management practices that improve food security and enhance agroecosystem resilience to climate change. However, the sustainable effectiveness of NT greatly depends on trade-offs between NT-induced changes in crop yield and greenhouse gas (GHG, i.e. CH4, CO2, and N2O) emissions. Such trade-offs are regulated by climate fluctuations and heterogeneous soil conditions and have not been well addressed. Supporting CSA management decisions requires advancing our understanding of how NT affects crop yield and GHG emissions in different agroecological regions. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted using 740 paired measurements from 90 peer-reviewed articles to assess the effects of NT on crop yield, GHG emissions, and the global warming potential (GWP) of major cereal cropping systems. Compared to conventional tillage (CT), NT reduced in GHG emissions and increased crop yield in dry, but not humid, climates, and reduced in the GWP at sites with acidic soils. Across different cropping systems, NT enhanced barley yield by 49%, particularly in dry climates, and it decreased the GWP of rice fields through a 22% reduction in both CO2 and CH4 emissions. Our synthesis suggests that NT is an effective CSA management practice because of its potential for climate change mitigation and crop yield improvement. However, the net effect of NT (relative to CT) was influenced by several environmental and agronomic factors (climatic conditions, tillage duration, soil texture, pH, crop species). Therefore, agroecological setting must be taken into consideration when conducting a comparative evaluation of different tillage practices.",Climate change mitigation; Crop yield; Greenhouse gas emissions; No-tillage
157,included,A keystone microbial enzyme for nitrogen control of soil carbon storage,"Agricultural and industrial activities have increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition to ecosystems worldwide. N deposition can stimulate plant growth and soil carbon (C) input, enhancing soil C storage. Changes in microbial decomposition could also influence soil C storage, yet this influence has been difficult to discern, partly because of the variable effects of added N on the microbial enzymes involved. We show, using meta-analysis, that added N reduced the activity of lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs), and that this N-induced enzyme suppression was associated with increases in soil C. In contrast, N-induced changes in cellulase activity were unrelated to changes in soil C. Moreover, the effects of added soil N on LME activity accounted for more of the variation in responses of soil C than a wide range of other environmental and experimental factors. Our results suggest that, through responses of a single enzyme system to added N, soil microorganisms drive long-term changes in soil C accumulation.

158,excluded,Does conservation agriculture deliver climate change mitigation through soil carbon sequestration in tropical agro-ecosystems?,"Conservation agriculture (CA), comprising minimum soil disturbance, retention of crop residues and crop diversification, is widely promoted for reducing soil degradation and improving agricultural sustainability. It is also claimed to mitigate climate change through soil carbon sequestration: we conducted a meta-analysis of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock changes under CA practices in two tropical regions, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), to quantify this. In IGP annual increases in SOC stock compared to conventional practice were between 0.16 and 0.49 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). In SSA increases were between 0.28 and 0.96 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), but with much greater variation and a significant number of cases with no measurable increase. Most reported SOC stock increases under CA are overestimates because of errors introduced by inappropriate soil sampling methodology. SOC increases require careful interpretation to assess whether or not they represent genuine climate change mitigation as opposed to redistribution of organic C within the landscape or soil profile. In smallholder farming in tropical regions social and economic barriers can greatly limit adoption of CA, further decreasing realistic mitigation potential. Comparison with the decreases in greenhouse gas emissions possible through improved management of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in regions such as IGP where N use is already high, suggests that this is a more effective and sustainable means of mitigating climate change. However the mitigation potential, and other benefits, from crop diversification are frequently overlooked when considering CA and warrant greater attention. Increases in SOC concentration (as opposed to stock) in near-surface soil from CA cause improvements in soil physical conditions; these are expected to contribute to increased sustainability and climate change adaptation, though not necessarily leading to consistently increased crop yields. CA should be promoted on the basis of these factors and any climate change mitigation regarded as an additional benefit, not a major policy driver for its adoption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

159,excluded,Adverse drug reactions of spontaneous reports in shanghai pediatric population,"Background: Knowledge of drug safety in the pediatric population of China is limited. This study was designed to evaluate ADRs in children reported to the spontaneous reporting system (SRS) of Shanghai in 2009. Methodology and Principal Findings: Crude ADR reports submitted to Shanghai SRS in 2009 for individuals aged from birth to 17 years (including 17 years) were included. Data were analyzed with respect to age, gender, category of ADR (System Organ Class [SOC]), the severity of reports and type of reporter. Results: A male overrepresentation was observed regarding the total number of reports. The most frequently reported group of drugs were vaccines (42.15%). Skin rash and fever were the commonest symptoms reported in the total pediatric dataset. The proportion of children that suffered from a serious ADR was 2.16% and that for drug related deaths was 0.34%. And we found that the multiple drug exposure experienced a high proportion of serious ADRs compared with the single drug use (chi(2) = 15.99, P<0.0001). Sixty-five percent of ADRs were for children less than 6 years of age. And more than half of reports were from doctors. Conclusions: In our study, consumers were more likely to report new ADRs though they appear to contribute a relatively small percentage of total reports. We propose that patients would take an active role in reporting ADRs. More researches are needed in order to achieve better understanding the characteristics of ADRs in pediatric population of China.",
160,included,Can no-tillage stimulate carbon sequestration in agricultural soils? A meta-analysis of paired experiments,"Adopting no-tillage in agro-ecosystems has been widely recommended as a means of enhancing carbon (C) sequestration in soils. However, study results are inconsistent and varying from significant increase to significant decrease. It is unclear whether this variability is caused by environmental, or management factors or by sampling errors and analysis methodology. Using meta-analysis, we assessed the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) to conversion of management practice from conventional tillage (CT) to no-tillage (NT) based on global data from 69 paired-experiments, where soil sampling extended deeper than 40 cm. We found that cultivation of natural soils for more than 5 years, on average, resulted in soil C loss of more than 20 t ha(-1), with no significant difference between CT and NT. Conversion from CT to NT changed distribution of C in the soil profile significantly, but did not increase the total SOC except in double cropping systems. After adopting NT, soil C increased by 3.15 +/- 2.42 t ha(-1) (mean 95% confidence interval) in the surface 10 cm of soil, but declined by 3.30 +/- 1.61 t ha(-1) in the 20-40 cm soil layer. Overall, adopting NT did not enhance soil total C stock down to 40 cm. Increased number of crop species in rotation resulted in less C accumulation in the surface soil and greater C loss in deeper layer. Increased crop frequency seemed to have the opposite effect and significantly increased soil C by 11% in the 0-60 cm soil. Neither mean annual temperature and mean annual rainfall nor nitrogen fertilization and duration of adopting NT affected the response of soil C stock to the adoption of NT. Our results highlight that the role of adopting NT in sequestrating C is greatly regulated by cropping systems. Increasing cropping frequency might be a more efficient strategy to sequester C in agro-ecosystems. More information on the effects of increasing crop species and frequency on soil C input and decomposition processes is needed to further our understanding on the potential ability of C sequestration in agricultural soils.

161,excluded,Recommended nitrogen fertilization enhances soil carbon sequestration in china's monsoonal temperate zone,"China consumes more than one-third of the world's nitrogen (N) fertilizer, and an increasing amount of N fertilizer has been applied over the past decades. Although N fertilization can increase the carbon sequestration potentials of cropland in China, the quantitative effects of different N fertilizer application levels on soil carbon changes have not been evaluated. Therefore, a 12-year cultivation experiment was conducted under three N fertilizer application levels (no N fertilizer input, the recommended N fertilizer input after soil testing, and the estimated additional fertilizer input) to estimate the effect of N addition on soil carbon changes in the root layer (0-80 cm) and non-root layer (80-200 cm) using a within-study meta-analysis method. The results showed significant declines in the soil inorganic carbon (SIC) in the root layers and significant growth in the SIC in the non-root layers under N fertilizer input. The soil organic carbon (SOC) in the root layers and the non-root layer significantly decreased under all the treatments. In addition, the recommended N fertilizer application level significantly increased the SOC and soil total carbon stocks compared with the future N fertilizer application level and no N input, while the future N fertilization significantly decreased the SIC and soil total carbon compared with no N input. The results suggest that N fertilization can rearrange the soil carbon distribution over the entire soil profile, and the recommended N fertilization rather than excess N input can increase the soil carbon stock, which suggests that the national soil testing program in China can improve the soil carbon sequestration potential.",Root biomass distribution; Carbonate; Winter wheat; Soil organic carbon

While root ""priming"" of decomposition has been extensively investigated, it is not known how plants alter the molecular ecology of soil microbial decomposers. We disentangled the effects of Avena fatua, a common annual grass, on C-13-labeled root litter decomposition and quantified multiple genetic characteristics of soil bacterial and fungal communities. In our study, plants consistently suppressed rates of root litter decomposition. Microbes from planted soils had relatively more genes coding for low molecular weight compound degradation enzymes, while those from unplanted had more macromolecule degradation genes. Higher abundances of ""water stress"" genes in planted soils suggested that microbes experienced plant-induced water stress. We developed a conceptual model based on Mantel analyses of our extensive data set. This model indicates that plant root effects on the multiple soil environmental and microbial mechanisms involved in root litter decomposition act through changing the functional gene profiles of microbial decomposers living near plant roots.",Microbial function; organic carbon decomposition; preferential substrate utilization; rhizosphere priming effect; soil microbial community; water stress

Despite the evidence regarding the importance of soil for provision of local and global ecosystem services, such as water regulation and carbon sequestration, soil remains an under-investigated and undermined aspect of the environment. Here we evaluate to what extent soil indicators are taken into account in restoration. We focused on the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a highly fragmented biome and a global biodiversity hotspot. We conducted a systematic literature review and we showed that the majority (59%) of the studies on restoration did not consider any soil indicator. Studies that demonstrated the importance of soil indicators most commonly reported soil pH (71%, n = 44), followed by potassium content (66%, n = 41) and phosphorus (64.5%, n = 40), while the least reported indicator was water retention (6.5%, n = 4). Only 40% of the retrieved studies included information about reference sites or project baseline information. We complement our literature review with a case study on restoration in two areas of the Atlantic Forest. We found a relation between soil indicators such as soil organic matter, nitrogen, sodium and sand content, and aboveground indicators, confirming a necessity to include soil screening in restoration. Moreover, we found that prior to restoration none of these soil indicators were analyzed. This study highlights the gap that exists in soil data in restoration in studies on the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We urge scientists and practitioners to include basic soil analysis to maximize the successful outcomes of restoration.",Atlantic Forest; forest landscape restoration; gap analysis; restoration; soil-restoration relationship; systematic review
164,included,Tillage intensity affects total SOC stocks in boreo-temperate regions only in the topsoil-A systematic review using an ESM approach,"Shifting from high intensity (HT) to intermediate intensity (IT) or no tillage (NT) practices has been credited as being a promising agricultural management option towards climate change mitigation due to carbon (C) sequestration in the soil. The consequences of conversion from HT to mainly NT on soil organic carbon (SOC) have been subject to a number of meta-analyses revealing either a positive or non-significant effect. In this study, we used the equivalent soil mass (ESM) approach to evaluate SOC stock changes following the conversion from HT to IT and NT considering studies compiled within a systematic review. In order to maximize the use of available evidence, we used different substitution methods for imputing missing information on the variance of both SOC and bulk density (pb). Based on a total of 101 long-term field trials ( > 10 years), the positive effect of IT and NT compared to HT was found to be limited to the topsoil (0-30 cm depth). Estimated SOC stock increases for this particular depth ranged from 3.22 +/- 1.48 to 3.50 +/- 1.60 (HT vs. IT) and 4.19 +/- 1.82 to 4.23 +/- 1.92 Mg ha(-1) (HT vs. NT). Calculating stocks based on fixed depth layers and without consideration of the equivalent soil mass, respectively, resulted in an overestimation of the increase with 15 (HT vs. IT) and 47% (HT vs. NT and IT vs. NT). Due to shallow sampling depth, HT vs. IT and IT vs. NT comparisons were limited to 0-30 cm depth, but the effect of HT to NT conversion could also be determined for 0-60 cm. The results indicate that the NT sequestration potential is overvalued when neglecting deeper depths, since the SOC storage capacity was reduced to < 0.10 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). No linear relation between relative SOC stock changes and climate, soil, and cropping systems was found.",Soil organic carbon; Carbon sequestration; Tillage intensity; Soil equivalent mass; Meta-analysis
165,excluded,Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization: impacts of nitrogen species and land use type,"Climate warming, nitrogen (N) deposition and land use change are some of the drivers affecting ecosystem processes such as soil carbon (C) and N dynamics, yet the interactive effects of those drivers on ecosystem processes are poorly understood. This study aimed to understand mechanisms of interactive effects of temperature, form of N deposition and land use type on soil C and N mineralization. We studied, in a laboratory incubation experiment, the effects of temperature (15 vs. 25 A degrees C) and species of N deposition (NH4 (+)-N vs. NO3 (-)-N) on soil CO2 efflux, dissolved organic C (DOC) and N (DON), NH4 (+)-N, and NO3 (-)-N concentrations using intact soil columns collected from adjacent forest and grassland ecosystems in north-central Alberta. Temperature and land use type interacted to affect soil CO2 efflux, concentrations of DON, NH4 (+)-N and NO3 (-)-N in most measurement times, with the higher incubation temperature resulted in the higher CO2 efflux and NH4 (+)-N concentrations in forest soils and higher DON and NO3 (-)-N concentrations in grassland soils. Temperature and land use type affected the cumulative soil CO2 efflux, and DOC, DON, NH4 (+)-N and NO3 (-)-N concentrations. The form of N added or its interaction with the other two factors did not affect any of the C and N cycling parameters. Temperature and land use type were dominant factors affecting soil C loss, with the soil C in grassland soils more stable and resistant to temperature changes. The lack of short-term effects of the deposition of different N species on soil C and N mineralization suggest that maybe there was a threshold for the N effect to kick in and long-term experiments should be conducted to further elucidate the species of N deposition effects on soil C and N cycling in the studied systems.",
166,excluded,Factors associated with intrusive cancer-related worries in women undergoing cancer genetic risk assessment,"One hundred and twenty-eight women undergoing assessment for genetic risk of breast/ovarian cancer completed questionnaires at entry into the assessment process and following risk provision. The key variable of interest was the level of intrusive worries at each time, and factors associated with the level of intrusive worries following risk provision. Based on the CARA model (Renner, Pers Soc Psychol Bull 30:384-396, 2004), it was expected that an unexpected risk assessment (whether good or bad) would result in high levels of intrusive thoughts. Other potential moderators of worry included neuroticism, level of threat experienced (low control, high perceived risk), the use of differing coping efforts, and the available social support. Of note was that while levels of intrusive thoughts fell in all risk groups following risk provision, unexpectedly only women found to be at population risk reported an increase of active attempts to distract from intrusive worries at this time. The CARA model was not supported. However, intrusion scores were independently associated with higher levels of neuroticism, a lack of confidant support, and a confrontive coping response. Active avoidance scores were uniquely associated with being assigned as population risk, neuroticism, lack of confidant and affective support, and the use of avoidant coping. Together, these variables accounted for 33% of the variance in intrusion scores and 31% of the variance in avoidance scores. The implications of these findings is discussed.",

These models include the Combined model, Rint model, two hysteresis models, Randles' model, a modified Randles' model and two resistor-capacitor (RC) network models with and without hysteresis included. Two variations of the lithium-ion cell chemistry, namely the lithium-ion iron phosphate (LiFePO4) and lithium nickel manganese-cobalt oxide (LiNMC) are used for testing purposes. The model parameters and states are recursively estimated using a nonlinear system identification technique based on the dual Extended Kalman Filter (dual-EKF) algorithm. The dynamic performance of the model structures are verified using the results obtained from a self-designed pulsed-current test and an electric vehicle (EV) drive cycle based on the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) profile over a range of operating temperatures. Analysis on the ten model structures are conducted with respect to state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-power (SOP) estimation with erroneous initial conditions. Comparatively, both RC model structures provide the best dynamic performance, with an outstanding SOC estimation accuracy. For those cell chemistries with large inherent hysteresis levels (e.g. LiFePO4), the RC model with only one time constant is combined with a dynamic hysteresis model to further enhance the performance of the SOC estimator.

It is unclear what will be the consequences of such input changes on native soil carbon decomposition across ecosystems. By synthesizing data from 143 experimental comparisons, we show that, on average, fresh carbon input stimulates soil carbon decomposition by 14%. The response was lower in forest soils (1%) compared with soils from other ecosystems (>24%), and higher following inputs of plant residue-like substrates (31%) compared to root exudate-like substrates (9%). The responses decrease with the baseline soil carbon decomposition rate under no additional carbon input, but increase with the fresh carbon input rate. The rates of these changes vary significantly across ecosystems and with the carbon substrates being added.

169,included,"Impacts of plastic film mulching on crop yields, soil water, nitrate, and organic carbon in Northwestern China: A meta-analysis","In order to increase crop yield in semi-arid and arid areas, plastic film mulching (PFM) is widely used in Northwestern China. To date, many studies have addressed the effects of PFM on soil physical and biochemical properties in rain-fed agriculture in Northwestern China, but the findings of different studies are often contradictory. Therefore, a comprehensive review of the impacts of PFM on soil water content, soil nutrients and food production is needed. We compiled the results of 1278 observations to evaluate the overall effects of PFM on soil water content, the distribution of nitrate and soil organic carbon, and crop yield in rain-fed agriculture in Northwestern China. Our results showed that PFM increased soil moisture and nitrate concentration in topsoils (0-20 cm) by 12.9% and 28.2%, respectively, but slightly decreased (1.8%) soil organic carbon (SOC) content in the 0-10 cm soil layer. PFM significantly increased grain yields by 43.1%, with greatest effect in spring maize (79.4%). When related to cumulative precipitation during the crop growing season, yield increase from PFM was greatest (72.8%) at 200-300 mm, which was attributed to the large increase for spring maize and potato, implying that crop zoning would be beneficial for PFM in this region. When related to N application rate, crop yields benefited most from PFM (80.2%) at 200-300 kg/ha. A cost-benefit analysis indicated that PFM increased economic return by an average of 29.5%, with the best improvement for spring maize (71.1%) and no increase for spring wheat. In conclusion, PFM can significantly increase crop yield and economic return (especially for spring maize) in rain-fed agriculture areas of Northwestern China. Crop zoning is recommended for PFM to achieve the largest economic benefit. However, full account needs to be taken of the environmental impacts relating to N loss, SOC depletion and film pollution to evaluate the sustainability of PFM systems and further research is required to quantify and mitigate these impacts.",Plastic film mulching; Economic benefit; Grain yield; Soil water content; Nitrate
170,excluded,Do soil fauna really hasten litter decomposition? A meta-analysis of enclosure studies,"We present a meta-analysis of experiments in which researchers used litter bags or similar enclosures to explore three questions: Do soil macrofauna increase the removal of litter from the soil surface? How is this mass loss of litter by macrofauna affected by climate and litter quality? To what extent does litter loss from litter layer by macrofauna correspond with litter mineralization? In total, we found 132 published field experiments in which authors compared litter bags with mesh sizes that did permit or not permit access by soil fauna. Meta-analysis of these experiments indicated that litter removal was significantly greater from bags that did permitted rather than did not permitted soil macrofauna access. When we divided these studies according to climate, a significant positive effect of soil fauna on litter removal was only evident from the warm humid, temperate regions with correspond to deciduous forest zone. When studies from this climate zone were sorted according to litter C:N ratio, the effect of fauna was significant in all cases except when the ratio was low (<20), and the effect of fauna was greatest when the ratio was intermediate (20-30). To assess how litter removal from litter bags corresponds with mineralization, we reviewed 11 published experiments that used litter boxes that were or were not accessible to soil macrofauna and 8 studies where fauna was experimentally removed and added. These boxes contained both litter and a mineral soil layer, which allowed researchers to estimate litter removal from the litter layer, the increase in C content (C sequestration) in the mineral soil, and overall C mineralization (difference of the former and the latter number). Analysis of these experiments indicated that fauna significantly increased litter removal from the litter layer, which agreed with the litter bag meta-analysis, but did not significantly affect overall C mineralization. This is consistent with meta-analysis of seven studies showing that rate of leaf litter decomposition is significantly faster than decomposition of macrofauna feces produced from the same litter.

171,excluded,Carbon control on terrestrial ecosystem function across contrasting site productivities: the carbon connection revisited,"Understanding how altered soil organic carbon (SOC) availability affects microbial communities and their function is imperative in predicting impacts of global change on soil carbon (C) storage and ecosystem function. However, the response of soil microbial communities and their function to depleted C availability in situ is unclear. We evaluated the role of soil C inputs in controlling microbial biomass, community composition, physiology, and function by (1) experimentally excluding plant C inputs in situ for 9 yr in four temperate forest ecosystems along a productivity gradient in Oregon, USA; and (2) integrating these findings with published data from similar C-exclusion studies into a global meta-analysis. Excluding plant C inputs for 9 yr resulted in a 13% decrease in SOC across the four Oregon sites and an overall shift in the microbial community composition, with a 45% decrease in the fungal : bacterial ratio and a 13% increase in Gram-positive : Gram-negative bacterial ratio. Although gross N mineralization decreased under C exclusion, decreases in gross N immobilization were greater, resulting in increased net N mineralization rates in all but the lowest-productivity site. Microbial biomass showed a variable response to C exclusion that was method dependent; however, we detected a 29% decrease in C-use efficiency across the sites, with greater declines occurring in less-productive sites. Although extracellular enzyme activity increased with C exclusion, C exclusion resulted in a 31% decrease in microbial respiration across all sites. Our meta-analyses of published data with similar C-exclusion treatments were largely consistent with our experimental results, showing decreased SOC, fungal : bacterial ratios, and microbial respiration, and increased Gram-positive : Gram-negative bacterial ratio following exclusion of C inputs to soil. Effect sizes of SOC and respiration correlated negatively with the duration of C exclusion; however, there were immediate effects of C exclusion on microbial community composition and biomass that were unaltered by duration of treatment. Our field-based experimental results and analyses demonstrate unequivocally the dominant control of C availability on soil microbial biomass, community composition, and function, and provide additional insight into the mechanisms for these effects in forest ecosystems.",N-15 pool dilution; carbon-use efficiency; extracellular enzyme activity; gross N immobilization; gross N mineralization; meta-analysis; microbial ecology; microbial respiration; nitrogen cycle; phospholipid fatty acid analysis; soil carbon availability

Understanding carbon (C) dynamics in soil is important for assessing the soil C sequestration potential under elevated [CO2].

However, few studies have been carried out to examine what would happen in the subtropical or tropical areas where the ambient N deposition is high. In this study, we used open-top chambers to study the effect of elevated atmospheric [CO2] alone and together with N addition on the soil C dynamics in the first 4 years of the treatments applied in southern China. Above- and below-ground C input (tree biomass) into soil, soil respiration, soil organic C, and total N as well as dissolved organic C (DOC) were measured periodically in each of the open-top chambers. Soil samples were collected randomly in each chamber from each of the soil layers (0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm) using a standard soil sampling tube (2.5-cm inside diameter). Soil leachates were collected at the bottom of the chamber below-ground walls in stainless steel boxes. The highest above- and below-ground C input into soil was found in the high CO2 and high N treatment (CN), followed by the only high N treatment (N+), the only high CO2 treatment (C+), and then the control (CK) without any CO2 enrichment or N addition. DOC in the leachates was small for all the treatments. Export of DOC played a minor role in C cycling in our experiment. Generally, soil respiration rate in the chambers followed the order: CN treatment > C + treatment > N + treatment > the control. Except for the C+ treatment, there were no significant differences in soil total N among the CN treatment, N + treatment, and the control. Overall, soil organic C (SOC) was significantly affected by the treatments (p < 0.0001). SOC for all the soil layers in the treatments followed the order: CN treatment > N + treatment > C + treatment = CK treatment. Compared with the control, the higher SOC in the CN and N+ treatment was due to the greater above- and below-ground C input. The increased soil respiration in the C+ treatment led to the lower SOC. Elevated atmospheric [CO2] in the subtropical China accelerated soil C sequestration in this area; however, this increase would still need additional N input. The increased soil C pool was due to the enhanced tree growth. Special climatic condition in this area and the high density of tree planting might further accelerate soil C sequestration in this area.",
173,excluded,Dynamics of soil carbon in a beechwood chronosequence forest,"Accurate estimates of forest soil organic matter (OM) are now crucial to predictions of global C cycling. This work addresses soil C stocks and dynamics throughout a managed beechwood chronosequence (28-197 years old, Normandy, France). Throughout this rotation, we investigated the variation patterns of (i) C stocks in soil and humic epipedon, (ii) macro-morphological characteristics of humic epipedon, and (iii) mass, C content and C-to-N ratio in physical fractions of humic epipedon. The fractions isolated were large debris (>2000 mu m), coarse particular OM (cPOM, 200-2000 mu m), fine particular OM (fPOM, 50-200 mu m) and the mineral associated OM (MaOM, <50 mu m). Soil C stocks remained unchanged between silvicultural phases, indicating a weak impact of this even-aged forest rotation on soil C sequestration. While humic epipedon mass and depth only slightly varied with beech development, C stocks in the holorganic layers were modified and the use of physical fractionation allowed us to discuss different aspect of quantitative and qualitative changes that occurred throughout the silvicultural rotation. Hence, changes in humic epipedon composition may be attributed to the modification of beech life-history traits with its maturation (growth vs. reproduction). Our results showed that C-POM can reached very high values (68%) in organo-mineral layers of older managed forest and that C-MaOM did not significantly change revealing the resistance of humified fractions of humic epipedon to logging and regeneration practices. C-to-N results indicated that N was probably not a limiting factor to litter degradation and explained our findings that OM did not accumulate in O horizons. This work confirms that forest harvesting and regeneration practices may have few effects on soil and humic epipedon C stocks, and that short- and long-term effects can be complex and may imply mechanisms with opposite effects.

174,excluded,Why so glumm? Detecting depression clusters through graphing lifestyle-environs using machine-learning methods (glumm),"Background: Key lifestyle-environ risk factors are operative for depression, but it is unclear how risk factors cluster. Machine-learning (ML) algorithms exist that learn, extract, identify and map underlying patterns to identify groupings of depressed individuals without constraints. The aim of this research was to use a large epidemiological study to identify and characterise depression clusters through ""Graphing lifestyle-environs using machine-learning methods"" (GLUMM). Methods: Two ML algorithms were implemented: unsupervised Self-organised mapping (SOM) to create GLUMM clusters and a supervised boosted regression algorithm to describe clusters. Ninety-six ""lifestyle-environ"" variables were used from the National health and nutrition examination study (2009-2010). Multivariate logistic regression validated clusters and controlled for possible sociodemographic confounders. Results: The SOM identified two GLUMM cluster solutions. These solutions contained one dominant depressed cluster (GLUMM5-1, GLUMM7-1). Equal proportions of members in each cluster rated as highly depressed (17%). Alcohol consumption and demographics validated clusters. Boosted regression identified GLUMM5-1 as more informative than GLUMM7-1. Members were more likely to: have problems sleeping; unhealthy eating; <= 2 years in their home; an old home; perceive themselves underweight; exposed to work fumes; experienced sex at <= 14 years; not perform moderate recreational activities. A positive relationship between GLUMM5-1 (OR: 7.50, P < 0.001) and GLUMM7-1 (OR: 7.88, P < 0.001) with depression was found, with significant interactions with those married/living with partner (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Using ML based GLUMM to form ordered depressive clusters from multitudinous lifestyle-environ variables enabled a deeper exploration of the heterogeneous data to uncover better understandings into relationships between the complex mental health factors.

175,excluded,Improving the diagnostic yield of single-operator cholangioscopy-guided biopsy of indeterminate biliary strictures: rose to the rescue? (with video),"Background and Aims: Tissue diagnosis, regardless of technique or endoscope used, can be challenging in patients with indeterminate biliary strictures (IDBSs). This exploratory study evaluated the utility and role of rapid onsite evaluation of touch imprint cytology (ROSE-TIC) when single-operator cholangioscopy (SOC)-guided biopsies of IDBSs are performed. Methods: Patients with IDBSs were evaluated by intraprocedural ROSE-TIC during SOC-guided biopsy procedures. Final diagnosis was established by long-term patient follow-up in conjunction with off-site findings or surgical histology. The main outcome measure was to evaluate the utility of ROSE-TIC by determination of its operating characteristics and comparison with off-site histologic assessment. Results: Of 31 patients with IDBSs, tissue diagnosis was indeterminate at prior ERCP-guided brush and/or biopsy in 14, prior EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA) in 6, and a mass could not be identified at EUS in 11. The mean number of biopsies performed was 3.3 (range 1-8), and diagnostic interpretation by ROSE-TIC was diagnostic and/or suspicious for carcinoma in 15, benign in 13, atypical-reactive in 2, and bile duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in 1. Final diagnosis by surgical histology (n = 4), death by disease (n = 10), and patient follow-up (n = 17) showed that the overall sensitivity of ROSE-TIC for diagnosing malignancy was 100%, specificity 88.9%, positive predictive value 86.7%, negative predictive value 100%, and diagnostic accuracy 93.5%. Conclusions: Preliminary data suggest that the diagnostic outcomes of SOC-guided biopsies in IDBSs can be significantly improved by using ROSE-TIC. This technique also may benefit centers that rely mainly on fluoroscopy-guided intraductal biopsies.",
176,excluded,Temperature response of soil respiration largely unaltered with experimental warming,"The respiratory release of carbon dioxide (CO2) from soil is a major yet poorly understood flux in the global carbon cycle. Climatic warming is hypothesized to increase rates of soil respiration, potentially fueling further increases in global temperatures. However, despite considerable scientific attention in recent decades, the overall response of soil respiration to anticipated climatic warming remains unclear. We synthesize the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling > 3,800 observations representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Moreover, across all nondesert biomes, respiration rates with and without experimental warming follow a Gaussian response, increasing with soil temperature up to a threshold of similar to 25 degrees C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.",soil respiration; climate change; experimental warming; temperature sensitivity; biome
177,excluded,Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and the vascular system: beyond their metabolic effects,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) alpha and gamma are ligand-activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. PPAR alpha has effects on fatty acid metabolism and its activation by fibrates results in reduction of triglyceride concentrations in blood. PPAR gamma induces differentiation of adipocytes, and its activation by thiazolidinediones (TZDs) has insulin sensitizing effects, for which reason these agents are used for treating type 2 diabetes. PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma are present in the vasculature, where they have been shown to exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and to blunt the development of fibrosis and remodeling in experimental models and in several cardiovascular clinical conditions. This review will discuss some of the evidence, both experimental and clinical, that suggests that activation of PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma in hypertension may exert beneficial cardiovascular protective effects. However, a recent meta-analysis suggests an excess of myocardial infarction and borderline excess of cardiovascular death in type 2 diabetic patients treated with rosiglitazone. Thus the safety of use of PPAR gamma activators for cardiovascular prevention and whether they are protective or actually may be harmful remains to be established.

178,included,Carbon sequestration and net emissions of CH4 and N2O under agroforestry: Synthesizing available data and suggestions for future studies,"While there have been many valuable individual studies of the effects of agroforestry on changes in net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, this information has not yet been brought together to provide an overall assessment of the effects of agroforestry. We therefore compiled and analysed data from 109 earlier observations from 56 peer-reviewed publications of net rates of change of biomass and/or soil carbon (C) stocks in agroforestry systems, and from 26 data sets from 15 peer-reviewed publications of net changes in the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). We categorized agroforestry into two distinct types: tree-crop coexistence types where trees and agricultural crops are grown together (type 1) and tree-crop rotation type where trees and crops are grown alternately on the same piece of land (type 2). We primarily assessed the changes in C storage and net GHG emissions between agriculture and type 1 agroforestry. The data showed high variability in net C sequestration rates in both biomass and soils depending on the type of agroforestry, with reported C increments ranging from 0.3 to 7.7 t C ha−1 y−1 in biomass and 1.0 to 7.4 t C ha−1 y−1 in soils. On average, type 1 stands sequestered 3.8 ± 1.3 t C ha−1 y−1 in above-ground biomass, with no evidence of changed rates for stands aged 5–25 years. All available studies exclusively reported increases in soil C stocks, with highest reported soil C sequestration rates of more than 8 t C ha−1 y−1 for the first year after agroforestry establishment. Averaged across all observations, soil C sequestration rates were about 2 t C ha−1 y−1 in youngest stands that gradually diminished with time since stand establishment. Overall, type 1 agroforestry stands (at an average age of 14 years) sequestered 7.2 ± 2.8 t C ha−1 y−1, with biomass and soil C sequestration contributing about 70% and 30% of that increment, respectively. Soils under agroforestry also oxidised 1.6 ± 1.0 kg CH4 ha−1 y−1 and emitted 7.7 ± 3.3 kg N2O ha−1 y−1. Comparing agroforestry and adjacent agricultural lands, we found only minor differences in net CH4 and N2O emissions, with no clear overall direction of change. Overall, agroforestry was estimated to contribute to mitigating 27 ± 14 t CO2 equivalents ha−1 y−1 at least for the first 14 years after establishment. It is suggested that future studies should consider strategic approaches for data acquisition that develop comprehensive approaches to quantify all components of the GHG balance, relate net GHG emissions with quantification of the yield of produce, and develop models to summarise the findings.","Agroforestry

179,excluded,Stimulation of N2O emission by manure application to agricultural soils may largely offset carbon benefits: a global meta-analysis,"Animal manure application as organic fertilizer does not only sustain agricultural productivity and increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, but also affects soil nitrogen cycling and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, given that the sign and magnitude of manure effects on soil N2O emissions is uncertain, the net climatic impact of manure application in arable land is unknown. Here, we performed a global meta-analysis using field experimental data published in peer-reviewed journals prior to December 2015. In this meta-analysis, we quantified the responses of N2O emissions to manure application relative to synthetic N fertilizer application from individual studies and analyzed manure characteristics, experimental duration, climate, and soil properties as explanatory factors. Manure application significantly increased N2O emissions by an average 32.7% (95% confidence interval: 5.1-58.2%) compared to application of synthetic N fertilizer alone. The significant stimulation of N2O emissions occurred following cattle and poultry manure applications, subsurface manure application, and raw manure application. Furthermore, the significant stimulatory effects on N2O emissions were also observed for warm temperate climate, acid soils (pH < 6.5), and soil texture classes of sandy loam and clay loam. Average direct N2O emission factors (EFs) of 1.87% and 0.24% were estimated for upland soils and rice paddy soils receiving manure application, respectively. Although manure application increased SOC stocks, our study suggested that the benefit of increasing SOC stocks as GHG sinks could be largely offset by stimulation of soil N2O emissions and aggravated by CH4 emissions if, particularly for rice paddy soils, the stimulation of CH4 emissions by manure application was taken into account.",animal manure; emission factor; greenhouse gas balance; manure characteristics; meta-analysis; nitrous oxide; soil pH; soil texture
180,excluded,Policy design for forest carbon sequestration: a review of the literature,"Forest carbon enhancement provides a low-cost opportunity in climate policy, but needs efficient policy design to be implemented. This paper reviews studies in economics on efficient design of policies for forest carbon sequestration and compares their findings against design systems in practice. Specific design problems are associated with the heterogeneity of landowners, uncertainty, additionality, and permanence in carbon projects. Different types of discounting of the value of the forest carbon sink compared with emissions abatement are suggested in the literature for management of most design problems, together with optimal contract design and emissions baselines for managing additionality and permanence in carbon sequestration. Design systems in practice, where forest carbon corresponds to 0.5% of all carbon volume subject to a pricing mechanism, mainly rely on additionality tests by approved standards on a project-by-project basis, and on buffer credits for management of permanence. Further development of forest carbon sinks as offsets in voluntary and compliance markets can be facilitated by applying tools for contract design and offset baseline management recommended in the literature.

181,included,Do cover crops benefit soil microbiome? A meta-analysis of current research,"Cover cropping is a promising sustainable agricultural method with the potential to enhance soil health and mitigate consequences of soil degradation. Because cover cropping can form an agroecosystem distinct from that of bare fallow, the soil microbiome is hypothesized to respond to the altered environmental circumstances. Despite the growing number of primary literature sources investigating the relationship between cover cropping and the soil microbiome, there has not been a quantitative research synthesis that is sufficiently comprehensive and specific to this relationship. We conducted a meta-analysis by compiling the results of 60 relevant studies reporting cover cropping effects on soil microbial properties to estimate global effect sizes and explore the current landscape of this topic. Overall, cover cropping significantly increased parameters of soil microbial abundance, activity, and diversity by 27%, 22%, and 2.5% respectively, compared to those of bare fallow. Moreover, cover cropping effect sizes varied by agricultural covariates like cover crop termination or tillage methods. Notably, cover cropping effects were less pronounced under conditions like continental climate, chemical cover crop termination, and conservation tillage. This meta-analysis showed that the soil microbiome can become more robust under cover cropping when properly managed with other agricultural practices. However, more primary research is still needed to control between-study heterogeneity and to more elaborately assess the relationships between cover cropping and the soil microbiome","Microbial abundance

DESIGN: Systematic literature review. SETTING: Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults with delirium. MEASUREMENTS: The MEDLINE (January 1980-December 2010) and Cochrane Databases were searched using the keywords ""delirium"" and ""antipsychotics."" References of review articles were reviewed to identify additional studies. Study selection criteria included prospective design, more than 10 participants (in treatment arms), mean age 60 and older, standardized criteria for diagnosing delirium, and validated delirium rating scales for reporting outcomes. RESULTS: Thirteen articles met selection criteria: six single-agent and seven comparison studies. Of these, eight (62%) had fewer than 25 participants in treatment arms, 10 (77%) recruited participants from psychiatry referrals, and eight (62%) did not clearly describe their screening methods. All single-agent studies were open-label studies. Of the comparison studies, five (71%) used randomization, but only one of these (a placebo-controlled study) used adequate allocation concealment methods, and only one other study (comparing two antipsychotics) described a double-blind method in detail. In the only placebo-controlled study (which was stopped early), no statistically significant differences in mean delirium severity scores were found at individual time points (Days 2, 3, 4, 7, 10). The other 12 studies reported improvements in delirium severity or resolution of delirium based on cutoff scores of the scales, but it is not clear from any of these studies what the natural course of delirium would have been without use of antipsychotics. CONCLUSION: Because of severe methodological limitations, the studies in this review do not support the use of antipsychotics in the treatment of delirium in older hospitalized adults. Additional well-designed randomized placebo-controlled trials are needed. J Am Geriatr Soc 59:S269-S276, 2011.",
183,included,Changes in soil carbon stocks across the Forest-Agroforest-Agriculture/Pasture continuum in various agroecological regions: A meta-analysis,"The contribution of agroforestry systems (AFS) to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in soil layers due to the presence of deep tree roots are of interest in the context of promoting carbon sinks and greenhouse gas mitigation. To quantify the relative soil C contribution from trees in agroforestry systems (AFS), this study assessed the reported differences in SOC stocks under agroforestry systems in comparison with other land-use systems (Agriculture, Forestry, Pasture, or Uncultivated Land) in various soil-depth classes in four agroecological regions (arid and semiarid, ASA; lowland humid tropics, LHT; Mediterranean, MED; and temperate, TEM) around the world. Using mixed-effect models and a meta-analytical approach, we synthesized data from 78 peer-reviewed studies that generated 858 data points (sites) on SOC stock under various AFS practiced globally. Comparing Agroforest vs. Agriculture or Agroforest vs. Pasture, SOC stocks under AFS were higher by + 27% in the ASA region, + 26% in LHT, and + 5.8% in TEM, but -5.3% in the TEM in the 0-100 cm soil depth. The Agroforest aged between 10-20 years had higher SOC stock than newly established, as well as < 10-year-old systems across all soil-depth classes and agroecological regions. Overall, Agroforest vs. Agriculture land management practices resulted in positive SOC stock changes within AFS up to 100 cm soil depth, whereas SOC stock under AFS was lower than under Forest. The results suggest that a general pattern of Forest - Agroforest - Agriculture - Pasture continuum could be expected in SOC stock decline during land-use changes. Improvement of SOC stocks under AFS varied across agroecological regions, the highest being under arid and semiarid region, closely followed by the low humid tropics. The important outcome of this meta-analysis is worthy of emphasizing of the role of AFS in climate change adaptation and greenhouse gas mitigation strategies by promoting carbon sinks.",Agroecological region; Agroforestry; Climate-change mitigation; Land-use systems; Mixed-effects model; Soil C stocks

All observational studies reporting the incidence of IHPOD after TAVR (sample size>25) were included in our meta-analysis. The reported incidence rates were weighted to obtain a pooled estimate rate with 95% confidence interval (CI). ResultsOf 96 potentially relevant articles, 31 with a total of 32,389 individuals who underwent TAVR were included in the meta-analysis. The crude incidence of IHPOD after TAVR ranged from 0% to 44.6% in included studies, with a pooled estimate rate of 8.1% (95% CI=6.7-9.4%); heterogeneity was high (Q=449; I=93%; p(heterogeneity)<.001).

185,included,Crop traits drive soil carbon sequestration under organic farming,"1. Organic farming (OF) enhances top soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in croplands compared with conventional farming (CF), which can contribute to sequester C. As farming system differences in the amount of C inputs to soil (e.g. fertilization and crop residues) are not enough to explain such increase, shifts in crop residue traits important for soil C losses such as litter decomposition may also play a role. 2. To assess whether crop residue (leaf and root) traits determined SOC sequestration responses to OF, we coupled a global meta-analysis with field measurements across a European-wide network of sites. In the meta-analysis, we related crop species averages of leaf N, leaf-dry matter content, fine-root C and N, with SOC stocks and sequestration responses in OF vs. CF. Across six European sites, we measured the management-induced changes in SOC stocks and leaf litter traits after long-term ecological intensive (e.g. OF) vs. CF comparisons. 3. Our global meta-analysis showed that the positive OF-effects on soil respiration, SOC stocks, and SOC sequestration rates were significant even in organic farms with low manure application rates. Although fertilization intensity was the main driver of OF-effects on SOC, leaf and root N concentrations also played a significant role. Across the six European sites, changes towards higher leaf litter N in CF also promoted lower SOC stocks. 4. Our results highlight that crop species displaying traits indicative of resource-acquisitive strategies (e.g. high leaf and root N) increase the difference in SOC between OF and CF. Indeed, changes towards higher crop residue decomposability was related with decreased SOC stocks under CF across European sites.",meta-analysis
186,included,Soil [N] modulates soil C cycling in CO2-fumigated tree stands: a meta-analysis,"Under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, soil carbon (C) inputs are typically enhanced, suggesting larger soil C sequestration potential. However, soil C losses also increase and progressive nitrogen (N) limitation to plant growth may reduce the CO2 effect on soil C inputs with time. We compiled a data set from 131 manipulation experiments, and used meta-analysis to test the hypotheses that: (1) elevated atmospheric CO2 stimulates soil C inputs more than C losses, resulting in increasing soil C stocks; and (2) that these responses are modulated by N. Our results confirm that elevated CO2 induces a C allocation shift towards below-ground biomass compartments. However, the increased soil C inputs were offset by increased heterotrophic respiration (Rh), such that soil C content was not affected by elevated CO2. Soil N concentration strongly interacted with CO2 fumigation: the effect of elevated CO2 on fine root biomass and -production and on microbial activity increased with increasing soil N concentration, while the effect on soil C content decreased with increasing soil N concentration. These results suggest that both plant growth and microbial activity responses to elevated CO2 are modulated by N availability, and that it is essential to account for soil N concentration in C cycling analyses.",tree stand

In this study, a pot experiment was conducted to investigate the responses of rice yield and the fate of fertilizer N to different SOC levels using 15N-labelled urea. The results showed that rice biomass, yield and the total N uptake increased significantly with increasing SOC content. Both rice N uptake from soil and urea increased significantly with increasing SOC content. The recovery rate and residual rate of fertilizer N improved significantly with increasing SOC content, leading to a reduced rate of not-specified fertilizer N. Therefore, it was concluded that high SOC could not only improve rice yield and fertilizer N recovery, but also could increase the retention of fertilizer N and decrease the not-specified N in the paddy soil.",Oryza sativa; isotope tracing; soil fertility; fertilization; flooded rice system; macronutrient
188,included,Impacts of forests and forestation on hydrological services in the Andes: A systematic review,"Several Andean countries have planned to restore forest cover in degraded land to enhance the provision of multiple ecosystem services in response to international commitments such as the Bonn Challenge. Hydrological services, e.g. water supply, hydrological regulation and erosion mitigation, are particularly important to sustain the life of more than fifty million Andean people. While rapid and important forest cover changes have occurred during recent decades, critical information on the impact of forestation on hydrological services has not yet been synthesized in the context of Andean ecosystems. We define forestation as the establishment of forest by plantation or natural regeneration on areas that either had forest in the past or not. To help improve decision-making on forestation in the Andes, we reviewed the available literature concerning the impacts of forestation on water supply, hydrological regulation and mitigation of erosion and landslides. We also examined available data on the most relevant hydrological processes such as infiltration, evapotranspiration and runoff in forest stands. Hydrological services from native forests were also included as a reference state for comparing processes and services provided by forestation. Following systematic review protocols, we synthesized 155 studies using different methods, including meta-analyses and meta-regressions. Results show that forestation has had clear impacts on degraded soils, through reducing water erosion of soils and risk of moderate floods, increasing soil infiltration rate by 8 and topsoil organic matter (SOM). We found that 20 years of tree plantation was sufficient to recover infiltration rate and sediment yield close to the levels of native forests whereas SOM, soil water storage and surface runoff of native forests could not be recovered by forestation in the time scales examined. The benefits in terms of hydrological regulation are at the expense of a reduction in total water supply since forest cover was associated with higher water use in most Andean regions. Forestation with native species was under-epresented in the reviewed studies. The impact of forestation on landslides has also been largely overlooked in the Andes. At high elevations, exotic tree plantations on Andean grasslands (e.g. paramo and puna) had the most detrimental consequences since these grasslands showed an excellent capacity for hydrological regulation and erosion mitigation but also a water yield up to 40% higher than tree plantations. People engaged in forest restoration initiative should be aware that hydrological services may take some time for society and the environment to show clear benefits after forestation.",Behavioral research; Conservation; Decision making; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Erosion; Infiltration; Landslides; Restoration; Runoff; Soil moisture; Water supply; Ecosystem services; Erosion mitigation; Forest cover change; Forest restoration; Hydrological process; Hydrological services; Natural regeneration; Soil water storage; Reforestation; ecosystem service; evapotranspiration; forest cover; forestry practice; hydrology; literature review; regeneration; sediment yield; soil degradation; soil organic matter; soil water; water erosion; Andes
189,excluded,Do low control response rates always affect the findings? Assessments of smoking and obesity in two australian case-control studies of cancer,"Objective: Participation rates have been declining in case-control studies, particularly among controls, raising concerns about possible bias. Formal assessments of the effect of low participation on odds ratios (OR) are seldom presented however. We sought to quantify possible bias using multiple imputation techniques. Methods: Using data from two Australian case-control studies, we estimated the relative risks of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and adenocarcinoma (OAC), and serous ovarian cancer (SOC) associated with smoking and body mass index (BMI). We compared ORs observed using self-reported data from participating controls with ORs derived using imputed exposures for non-participating controls. Results: Participating controls were less likely than non-participants to smoke currently. Smoking remained significantly associated with oesophageal cancer even under the most extreme assumption of smoking prevalence among non-participants (OSCC: observed OR 6.54, 4.62-9.28, imputed OR 3.94, 2.83-5.49; OAC: observed OR 2.69, 1.87-3.85 imputed OR 1.58, 1.13-2.22). For SOC however, risks associated with smoking were attenuated to null under plausible smoking assumptions among non-participants. BMI distributions were similar among participating and non-participating controls, and risk estimates were essentially unchanged. Conclusion and implications: Bias is not an inevitable consequence of low control participation and depends on the association examined. Sensitivity analyses can assist in interpretation of results.",

Confirmatory factor analysis validated the existence of four dimensions in the scale: blatant group discrimination, subtle group discrimination, blatant individual discrimination, and subtle individual discrimination. In accordance with the literature, the scale presents positive relations with the stigma consciousness scale (Pinel in J Pers Soc Psychol 76:114-128, 1999) and negative relations with two measures of psychological well-being, affect balance and self-acceptance.

(Manage. Sci. 35 (1989) 982-1003), user attitudes have been considered an important determinant of IS adoption. Their impact on behavior is rooted in behavioral frameworks such as the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein and Ajzen, Belief, Attitude, Intention and Behavior: An Introduction to Theory and Research, Addison-Wesley, 1975) and the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, Organ. Behav. Hum. Decis. Processes. 50 (1991) 179-211). However, in IS adoption models, the predictive power of attitudes for behavior as an endogenous variable has proven strong in some circumstances and weak in others (Bagozzi and Yi, Soc. Psychol. Q 52 (1989) 266-279; Taylor and Todd, MIS Q 19 (1995) 561-570). These inconsistencies resulted in an exclusion of the construct attitude from further modified versions of the TAM and other models explaining individual IS adoption and use. To better understand the prevalence of inconsistent attitude-behavior relationships in IS adoption models, this research follows social psychological research practices focusing on situational factors prone to result in insignificant attitude-behavior relationships. To test for the impact of these factors on the attitude-behavior relationship, the article raises the level of analysis to a higher level of abstraction. A scientometric literature review and a meta-analysis of 14 top IS journals from 1989 to 2014 finds that three out of four situational factors positively influence the attitude-behavior relationship in the IS fields: voluntariness, technology type, and adoption context. These factors constitute ""the attitude cube"", which provides conceptual guidance for researchers in assessing the conditions under which the attitude-behavior relationship is likely to be weak or strong.

192,included,A synthesis of change in deep soil organic carbon stores with afforestation of agricultural soils,"Afforestation is known as an available mitigation activity to climate change because it causes sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere and stores it as the living biomass and the dead organic matter. However, the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) to afforestation in deep soil layers is still poorly understood. We surveyed previously published literature for changes in deep SOC (defined as at least 10 cm deeper than the 0-10 cm layer) after afforestation of croplands and grasslands (total 63 sites from 56 literature), in order to examine changes in deep SOC and quantify the relationship between SOC change rates in topsoil and subsoil. The results of the meta analysis indicated that the responses of SOC to afforestation were opposite for cropland than grassland. The SOC in soil depth layers of 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60 and 60-80 cm were reduced with afforestation of grassland but not significantly (p > 0.05), while conversion of cropland to forests (trees or shrubs) increased SOC significantly for each soil depth layer up to 60 cm depth (p < 0.05). Significant relationships of SOC change rate were found between topsoil (0-20 cm) and deeper soil layers (20-40 and 40-60 cm). The linear regression showed that SOC change rate in 0-40 cm, 0-60 cm, and 0-100 cm soil profiles was 1.33, 1.49, and 1.55 times greater, respectively than the change rates in the corresponding 0-20 cm depth profile. Partial correlation analysis revealed that stand age and initial SOC content were determinants of deep soil SOC change after afforestation of agricultural soils. This study also showed that the O horizon can play an important role in carbon sequestration after afforestation of agricultural sites. We concluded that subsoil carbon must be taken into account when evaluating of SOC change with afforestation and, therefore, recommended that the soil sampling depth for afforested soils be set to at least 60 cm in mineral soils and include the O horizon. However, due to poor study designs and lack of standardized sampling protocols in the literature, these results were high in uncertainty. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

193,included,A meta-analysis of the temporal dynamics of priming soil carbon decomposition by fresh carbon inputs across ecosystems,"Priming of soil organic matter decomposition by fresh carbon inputs is a key ecological process determining soil carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Although this priming effect (PE) has been studied under various environmental conditions, the conclusions are inconsistent across space and time and the underlying mechanisms unclear. We used a meta-analysis with extensive datasets of CO2 effluxes from soils with C-13 or C-14 labelled fresh C inputs and without fresh C inputs under various soil conditions to synthesize and assess the temporal dynamics of the PE. The results indicated that the PE declined in 20 days on average from 67(-21)(+26)% (95% confidence interval) immediately following the fresh C inputs to less than 7.6(-1.8)(+2.0%) and remained relatively stable thereafter. We also assessed the variability of the temporal dynamics of the PE in the collected datasets and the underlying drivers. The results showed that the magnitude of PE at a specific time (i.e., the instantaneous PE after the fresh C inputs) was significantly and positively correlated with the instantaneous quantity of remaining fresh C. Under the same quantity of remaining fresh C, the PE varied significantly across ecosystems (in the order of grasslands < farmlands < forests < other ecosystems such as lake beds and volcanic soils), but, contrary to our expectation; the PE was independent of the quality of the added fresh C. We found that the PE experienced a faster decrease in soils with higher clay and moisture contents. These results describe the temporal dynamics of PE and the underlying drivers, underpinning the robust predictions of PE dynamics and their impact on soil C and nutrient balances.

194,excluded,Association of physical activity with survival among ambulatory patients on dialysis: the comprehensive dialysis study,"Background and objectives Despite high mortality and low levels of physical activity (PA) among patients starting dialysis, the link between low PA and mortality has not been carefully evaluated. Design, setting, participants, & measurements The Comprehensive Dialysis Study was a prospective cohort study that enrolled patients who started dialysis between June 2005 and June 2007 in a random sample of dialysis facilities in the United States. The Human Activity Profile (HAP) was administered to estimate PA among 1554 ambulatory enrolled patients in the Comprehensive Dialysis Study. Patients were followed until death or September 30, 2009, and the major outcome was all-cause mortality. Results The average age was 59.8 (14.2) years; 55% of participants were male, 28% were black, and 56% had diabetes mellitus. The majority (57.3%) had low fitness estimated from the HAP score. The median follow-up was 2.6 (interquartile range, 2.2-3.1) years. The association between PA and mortality was linear across the range of scores (1-94). After multivariable adjustment, lower adjusted activity score on the HAP was associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-1.39 per 10 points). Patients in the lowest level of fitness experienced a 3.5-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.54-4.89) increase in risk of death compared with those with average or above fitness. Conclusions Low levels of PA are strongly associated with mortality among patients new to dialysis. Interventions aimed to preserve or enhance PA should be prospectively tested.

Although numerous case studies have been conducted, there remains a lack of quantification of the consequences of such environmental and anthropogenic changes on the SOC sequestration across global agricultural systems. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis of SOC changes under different fertilizer managements, namely unbalanced application of chemical fertilizers (UCF), balanced application of chemical fertilizers (CF), chemical fertilizers with straw application (CFS), and chemical fertilizers with manure application (CFM). We show that topsoil organic carbon (C) increased by 0.9 (0.7-1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI)) g kg(-1) (10.0%, relative change, hereafter the same), 1.7 (1.2-2.3) g kg(-1) (15.4%), 2.0 (1.9-2.2) g kg(-1) (19.5%) and 3.5 (3.2-3.8) g kg(-1) (36.2%) under UCF, CF, CFS and CFM, respectively. The C sequestration durations were estimated as 28-73 years under CFS and 26-117 years under CFM but with high variability across climatic regions. At least 2.0 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) C input is needed to maintain the SOC in similar to 85% cases. We highlight a great C sequestration potential of applying CF, and adopting CFS and CFM is highly important for either improving or maintaining current SOC stocks across all agro-ecosystems.",agricultural systems. farmland. fertilisers. organic matter in soil. agricultural land. carbon. carbon sequestration. case studies. climate. data analysis. effects. farming systems. fertilizers. human activity. manures. meta-analysis. organic carbon. soil. soil chemistry. soil organic matter. straw. topsoil.
196,excluded,Interferon for hepatitis c virus in hemodialysis-an individual patient meta-analysis of factors associated with sustained virological response,"Background and objectives: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is prevalent in hemodialysis patients and causes excess mortality. Interferon (IFN) treatment of chronic HCV infection in hemodialysis patients results in high sustained virological response (SVR) rates 6 mo after treatment. The authors aimed to identify factors associated with SVR in hemodialysis patients through analysis of individual patient data obtained from systematic review of published literature. Design, setting, participants & measurements: Medline was searched from 1966 through February 2009, and prospective studies describing IFN treatment of hemodialysis patients with chronic HCV infection with published individual patient data were included. To identify factors associated with SVR, logistic regression was applied with adjustment for study. Results: Twenty studies of IFN treatment provided data on 428 patients. Overall SVR was 45% and in univariate analyses was higher with: 1) three million units or higher three times weekly of IFN; 2) treatment for at least 6 mo; 3) treatment completion; 4) lower baseline HCV RNA; 5) female gender; and 6) early virological negativity. Although limited by missing data, these relationships persisted in multivariate regression. Conclusions: SVR is more likely with larger IFN dose, longer treatment duration, treatment completion, female gender, lower HCV RNA and early virological negativity. For appropriate treatment candidates, regimens should consist of three million units of IFN three times weekly for at least 6 mo, with patients encouraged to complete the full course.

197,excluded,Conservation agriculture practices increase soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen in agricultural soils: A global meta-analysis,"Conservation agriculture through the use of crop residue retention and no-tillage (NT) has been widely practiced to improve agricultural soil quality, such as to increase soil organic carbon (C) content and the microbial population size. However, there has been no quantitative analysis on the effect of conservation agriculture, particularly in relation to crop residue retention, on soil microbial biomass C (C-mic) and nitrogen (N-mic), and the microbial quotient (qMIC, C-mic-to-organicC ratio), which are frequently used as indicators of soil health under different agricultural practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of conservation agriculture practices on soil C-mic, N-mic and qMIC on a global scale using meta-analysis based on data from 96 recent publications. Relative to conventional tillage (CT) without residue retention, NT without residue retention (NTRO) increased C-mic by 33% (P < 0.05), while NT with residue retention (NTR) increased (P < 0.05) C-mic, N-mic and qMIC by 25, 64, and 57%, respectively. Greater C-mic and N-mic were found in the NT than in the CT treatment, regardless of the soil condition (e.g., soil pH and texture), experimental duration, and climate (e.g., mean annual temperature and precipitation). Particularly, NTR was a promising conservation agriculture practice to increase C-mic and N-mic in global farmlands, and NTRO can be an alternate strategy for loam soils in the subhumid (600-1000 mm mean annual precipitation) region, or under long-term (> 20 yr) conservation agriculture practices. We conclude that NTR should be an important strategy that could be used to increase C-mic and N-mic contents and improve soil quality in global farmlands.",Soil microbial biomass carbon; Nitrogen; No tillage; Residue retention; Experimental duration; Soil condition
198,excluded,A meta-analysis of serum osteocalcin level in postmenopausal osteoporotic women compared to controls,"Background Circulatory osteocalcin (OC) has been widely used as a biomarker to indicate bone turnover status in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO). However, the change of serum OC (sOC) level in PMO cases compared to postmenopausal controls remains controversial. Methods We searched the online database of PubMed and Cochrane Library. A meta-analysis of case-control studies was performed to compare the pooled sOC level between PMO patients and postmenopausal controls. Subgroup analysis according to potential confounding factors (different OC molecules and regions of the study population) was also performed. Results Ten case-control studies with 1577 postmenopausal women were included in this meta analysis. We found no significant difference in the pooled sOC level [mean difference (MD) = 1.84, 95% confidence interval (CI): (- 1.49, 5.16), p = 0.28] between PMO patients and controls. Subgroup analysis also revealed no significant difference in intact OC [MD = 1.76, 95%CI: (- 1.71, 5.23), p = 0.32] or N-terminal mid-fragment of the OC molecule [MD = 0.67, 95%(- 5.83, 7.18), p = 0.84] between groups. For different regions, no significant difference in sOC was found in Asian population between cases and controls [MD = -0.06, 95%(- 6.02, 5.89), p = 0.98], while the pooled sOC level was significantly higher in European PMO cases than controls [MD = 3.15, 95%(0.90, 5.39), p = 0.006]. Conclusions Our analysis revealed no significant difference in sOC level between PMO cases and controls according to all the current eligible studies. OC molecules are quite heterogeneous in the circulation and can be influenced by glucose metabolism. Therefore, sOC is currently not a good indicator for the high bone turnover status in PMO. More trials with standardized methodologies for the evaluation of circulatory OC are awaited to update our current findings.",Osteocalcin; Bone turnover marker; Postmenopausal osteoporosis; Meta-analysis
199,excluded,Atmospheric co2 and soil extracellular enzyme activity: a meta-analysis and co2 gradient experiment,"Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations can alter carbon and nutrient cycling and microbial processes in terrestrial ecosystems. One of the primary ways microbes interact with soil organic matter is through the production of extracellular enzymes, which break down complex organic molecules and release nutrients into the soil. We conducted a meta-analysis of 34 studies that examined responses in microbial enzyme activity to elevated CO2. We also conducted a field study of soil enzyme activity in a tallgrass-prairie ecosystem growing in sandy loam (lower organic matter content) and clayey soils (higher organic matter content) exposed to a continuous gradient of 250 to 500 ppm CO2. Of the 10 enzyme groups examined in the meta-analysis, including those degrading starch, beta-glucan, cellulose, xylan/hemicellulose, lignin, organic P, and organic N, only the activity of one enzyme that degrades the C-and N-containing building blocks of chitin (N-acetyl-glucosaminidase) increased consistently at elevated CO2 by an average of 12.6% (p < 0.05), especially in field studies and in woody ecosystems. In our field study, increasing CO2 from subambient to elevated concentrations reduced the activity of leucine aminopeptidase by 32% in the black clay soil during the peak of the growing season, while beta-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase increased by 44% near the end of the season, indicating increased N limitation with increasing CO2. In the sandy loam soil, alkaline phosphatase activity increased by 42% with CO2 enrichment at the end of the growing season, suggesting CO2-induced phosphorus limitation in these soils. Additionally, a 53-83% decrease in the carbon cycling enzymes cellobiohydrolase, alpha-glucosidase, and xylosidase activity with increased CO2 was found in July. Our field study shows that soil type can strongly influence how microbial functioning may change with rising CO2 concentrations and that microbial responses associated with C-, N-, and P-cycling are likely to change-and may already have changed-with increasing CO2 under some soil types and conditions. Our meta-analysis revealed that, despite variable enzyme activities with CO2, chitinase activity increased consistently with CO2 across ecosystems.",
200,excluded,The role of ethical ideology in reactions to injustice,"Forsyth (J Pers Soc Psychol 39(1):175-184, 1980) argued that ethical ideology includes the two orthogonal dimensions of relativism and idealism. Relativists determine morality by looking at the complexities of the situation rather than relying on universal moral rules, while idealists believe that positive consequences can always be obtained without harming others. This study examined the role of ethical ideology as a moderator between justice and constructive and deviant reactions to injustice. Students with work experience (N = 200) completed Bennett and Robinson's (J Appl Psychol 85(3):349-360, 2000) measure of Workplace Deviance, Gill's (Reactions to injustice: Development and validation of a measure. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Western Ontario, 2005) Reactions to Injustice measure, and the Ethics Position Questionnaire (Forsyth, 1980), and provided ratings of justice in their own workplace. Hierarchical regressions revealed a significant main effect of idealism on deviance and constructive behaviors, and three-way interactions between idealism, relativism, and some types of justice. These findings suggest that ethical ideology plays a significant role in predicting responses to injustice.",
201,included,Minor stimulation of soil carbon storage by nitrogen addition: A meta-analysis,"It is a well-established concept that nitrogen (N) limits plant growth and ecosystem production. However, whether N limits land carbon (C) sequestration - particularly in soil, the largest pool in the land - remains highly controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis to synthesize 257 studies published in the literature with 512 paired comparisons to quantify the changes of ecosystem C processes in response to N addition. Our results show that N addition significantly increased aboveground, belowground, and litter C pools by 35.7, 23.0, and 20.9%, respectively, across all the studies. Despite the substantial increases in C inputs from vegetation to soil system, N addition resulted in no significant change in C storage of both organic horizon and mineral soil in forests and grasslands, but a significant 3.5% increase in agricultural ecosystems, largely due to less contribution from aboveground production and increases in DOC and soil respiration. Thus, N stimulation of C storage primarily occurred in plant pools but little in soil pools. Moreover, N-induced change in soil C storage was positively related to changes in belowground production but not to those in aboveground growth. Our global synthesis also suggests that earth system models need to treat soil C inputs from aboveground and belowground sources differentially for soil C sequestration in response to N deposition and fertilization.

202,excluded,Soil microbial responses to nitrogen addition in arid ecosystems,"The N cycle of arid ecosystems is influenced by low soil organic matter, high soil pH, and extremes in water potential and temperature that lead to open canopies and development of biological soil crusts (biocrusts). We investigated the effects of N amendment on soil microbial dynamics in a Larrea tridentata-Ambrosia dumosa shrubland site in southern Nevada USA. Sites were fertilized with a NO3-NH4 mix at 0, 7, and 15 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) from March 2012 to March 2013. In March 2013, biocrust (0-0.5 cm) and bulk soils (0-10 cm) were collected beneath Ambrosia canopies and in the interspaces between plants. Biomass responses were assessed as bacterial and fungal SSU rRNA gene copy number and chlorophyll a concentration. Metabolic responses were measured by five ecoenzyme activities and rates of N transformation. By most measures, nutrient availability, microbial biomass, and process rates were greater in soils beneath the shrub canopy compared to the interspace between plants, and greater in the surface biocrust horizon compared to the deeper 10 cm soil profile. Most measures responded positively to experimental N addition. Effect sizes were generally greater for bulk soil than biocrust. Results were incorporated into a meta-analysis of arid ecosystem responses to N amendment that included data from 14 other studies. Effect sizes were calculated for biomass and metabolic responses. Regressions of effect sizes, calculated for biomass, and metabolic responses, showed similar trends in relation to N application rate and N load (rate x duration). The critical points separating positive from negative treatment effects were 88 kg ha(-1) y(-1) and 159 kg ha(-1), respectively, for biomass, and 70 kg ha(-1) y(-1) and 114 kg ha(-1), respectively, for metabolism. These critical values are comparable to those for microbial biomass, decomposition rates and respiration reported in broader meta-analyses of N amendment effects in mesic ecosystems. However, large effect sizes at low N addition rates indicate that arid ecosystems are sensitive to modest increments in anthropogenic N deposition.",arid ecosystems; nitrogen deposition; microbial biomass; ecoenzyme activity; meta-analysis

Even though most studies have proved the potential of NBPT-treated urea to reduce NH3 loss, the benefits to increase crop yield have been less consistent, mainly because N is not always the limiting factor. A meta-analysis was carried out to evaluate the effect of soil properties (e.g., soil pH, soil texture, soil organic C [SOC]), N rate, and NBPT concentration on NH3 volatilization loss and crop yield when comparing urea with NBPT-treated urea. Regression analysis indicated cumulative NH3 loss of 31.0 and 14.8% of applied N for urea and NBPT-treated urea, respectively, a 52% reduction in NH3 loss by using the urease inhibitor. Th e use of NBPT delayed NH3 loss. It took 4.8 and 8.3 d for 50% of the total NH3 loss to occur for urea and NBPT-treated urea, respectively. Th e meta-analyses indicated that when compared with urea, NBPT-treated urea reduced NH3 volatilization loss across all soil pH classes, soil texture classes, SOC contents, N rates, and NBPT concentrations. Th e meta-analysis indicated an average crop yield increase of 5.3% for NBPT-treated urea compared with urea.

204,excluded,Models of pace-of-life syndromes (pols): a systematic review,"Variation in life history (LH) traits along the fast-slow continuum (referred to as pace of life, POL) is thought to result from a trade-off between investments in current versus future reproduction. Originally developed for understanding variation in LH strategies at the among-population level, the POL theory has more recently been applied towards understanding variation in LH traits at the within-population level, and further extended to address the covariance of LH traits with additional behavioural and/or physiological traits, referred to as pace-of-life syndromes (POLS). The article by Reale et al. (Philos T Roy Soc B 365: 4051-4063, 2010), which synthesized several earlier reviews and opinions on among-individual covariation between LH, behavioural, and physiological traits, and subsequent research testing POLS in a variety of species, have collectively been cited several hundreds of times-a trend that continues. These works have interdisciplinary impact, informing research in life history biology, behavioural and developmental biology, and the social sciences. In this paper, we review the existing theoretical POLS models that provide adaptive explanations for covariances between LH traits and additional behavioural and/or physiological traits while assuming a trade-off between current and future reproduction. We find that the set of relevant models is small. Moreover, models show that covariances between life history traits and behavioural or physiological traits can arise even in the absence of a current-future reproduction trade-off, implying that observing such covariances does not provide a strong indication regarding the process generating POLS.

Understanding the changes in soil C, nutrients and stoichiometry in planted forests is important for forest management. We conducted a global meta-analysis of changes in C, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) and their stoichiometry in mineral soils of planted forest across broad climatic zones from 139 papers. Soil C and N are slightly decreased after forestation on grassland, moderately increased after forestation on cropland, and substantially increased after forestation on barren land. Forestation does not affect total soil P, but the available P is significantly depleted after the forestation of grassland and cropland with N-fixers. Changes in soil nutrients (N, P and S) and shifts in stoichiometry (ratios of C:N, C:P and N:P) are significantly related to soil C dynamics (p < 0.05). Soil C sequestration is the lowest in the boreal zone, and greater under plantation with N-fixing species than under non-fixing species. Changes in soil C and nutrients after forestation mainly differ to prior land use. Compared with forestation of grassland, forestation of barren land is a more effective approach to enhancing C sequestration.",Carbon sequestration; Planted forests; Nutrient availability; Soil properties; Stoichiometry
206,excluded,Behavioral monitoring of sexual offenders against children in virtual risk situations: a feasibility study,"The decision about unsupervised privileges for sexual offenders against children (SOC) is one of the most difficult decisions for practitioners in forensic high-security hospitals. Facing the possible consequences of the decision for the society, a valid and reliable risk management of SOCs is essential. Some risk management approaches provide frameworks for the construction of relevant future risk situations. Due to ethical reasons, it is not possible to evaluate the validity of constructed risk situations in reality. The aim of the study was to test if behavioral monitoring of SOCs in high-immersive virtual risk situations provides additional information for risk management. Six SOCs and seven non-offender controls (NOC) walked through three virtual risk situations, confronting the participant with a virtual child character. The participant had to choose between predefined answers representing approach or avoidance behavior. Frequency of chosen answers were analyzed in regards to knowledge of the participants about coping skills and coping skills focused during therapy. SOCs and NOCs behavior differed only in one risk scenario. Furthermore, SOCs showed in 89% of all cases a behavior not corresponding to their own belief about adequate behavior in comparable risk situations. In 62% of all cases, SOCs behaved not corresponding to coping skills they stated that therapists focused on during therapy. In 50% of all cases, SOCs behaved in correspondence to coping skills therapists stated that they focused on during therapy. Therapists predicted the behavior of SOCs in virtual risk situations incorrect in 25% of all cases. Thus, virtual risk scenarios provide the possibility for practitioners to monitor the behavior of SOCs and to test their decisions on unsupervised privileges without endangering the community. This may provide additional information for therapy progress. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the predictive and ecological validity of behavioral monitoring in virtual risk situations for real life situations.",risk assessment; risk management; virtual reality; virtual environment; child abuser; pedophilic disorder; pedophilia

Less is known, however, on how soil nutrient availability changes over time and microsite post-wildfire. In October 2013 a wildfire approximately 30 km north of Reno, Nevada, occurred in an Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana (mountain big sagebrush) community. We quantified soil nutrient availability of surface soil (0-10 cm) by microsite (shrub interspace and shrub canopy), treatment (burned and unburned), and temporally (monthly from November 2013 through May 2015). Changes in nutrient availability, due to wildfire, largely occurred in shrub canopy microsites. For most months and relative to unburned shrub canopies, burned shrub canopies had elevated availability of mineral N (dominantly NH4+-N), bicarbonate-extractable P, DTPA-extractable Mn, and solution-phase Ca+2, Mg+2, SO4 (-2), K+, and ortho-P. Burned shrub canopies also had, for most months, far less N mineralization potentials than unburned shrub canopies. The large increase in Mn availability in burned shrub canopies significantly correlates with mineral N and solution-phase Ca+ 2 and SO4 (-2), suggesting release via pyrolysis of soil organic matter. Except for a slight increase in solution-phase Mg+2, SO4 (-2), and ortho-P for particular months, there is little evidence for nutrient translocation from burned canopies to adjacent interspaces during the study. Density of the exotic annual grass Bromus tectorum increased from 5 to 10% cover pre-wildfire to about 60% in the post-wildfire growing season attesting to the importance of elevated soil nutrient availability to its growth.",

DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. SETTING: International multicenter. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred and eight men and 1,619 women within 90 days of surgical repair of low-trauma hip fracture in the same study (for comparison). INTERVENTION: Once-yearly intravenous (IV) ZOL 5 mg (n = 248) or placebo (n = 260), loading dose of vitamin D, daily calcium, and vitamin D supplements. MEASUREMENT: Changes in BMD. RESULTS: Percentage change from baseline in total hip BMD at Months 12 and 24 was significantly higher with ZOL than with placebo (between-group difference, 2.0%, P = .003, and 3.8%, P = .002, respectively). Percentage change from baseline in femoral neck BMD at Month 24 was significantly higher with ZOL than with placebo (3.8%, P = .003). The BMD benefit was comparable with that observed in women in this study. New clinical fractures occurred in 36 (7.1%) participants (ZOL, n = 16; placebo, n = 20; P = .64). The ZOL safety profile was comparable with that of placebo, with no significant differences in cardiovascular or long-term renal function and a trend toward lower mortality in ZOL-treated men.

209,excluded,Manure and mineral fertilizer effects on crop yield and soil carbon sequestration: a meta-analysis and modeling across china,"Manure application to soil has declined globally due to increased availability of mineral fertilizers. However, mineral fertilizer overuse has caused serious consequences for soil quality and the environment. We analyzed the results of 20 long-term field trials (22-32 years, start year [ranged from 1980 to 1990] to 2012) and combined this with a climate change model and soil organic carbon (SOC) model to quantify the importance of manure and mineral fertilizers for grain yield and SOC sequestration across croplands in China. During the past three decades mineral fertilizers have increased grain yield for 91-184% but had minor impact on SOC sequestration (4-16%). In contrast, manure applied with mineral fertilizer increased grain yield by only 6-19% but strongly raised the SOC content (9-39%) compared with mineral fertilizer. Modeling (to the year 2099) indicated that manure used in combination with mineral fertilizers will increase future C sequestration in soils across China by 2,086 Tg C and by 2,482 Tg C based on current net primary productivity with no climate change and on increased net primary productivity with climate change scenarios, respectively. This corresponds to an additional 43-58% increase in C sequestration compared to mineral fertilizers only. The manure efficiency for C sequestration in soil was about 9.6% of C input and decreased with increasing SOC content. To maintain the current SOC content (i.e., 2010), 11 t.ha(-1).year(-1) fresh manure or 4.8 t.ha(-1).year(-1) dry maize straw would be required. We conclude that the regular use of manure with mineral fertilizers is essential for the long-term dual functions of soil for food production and SOC sequestration.",manure; carbon sequestration; long-term experiments; RothC model; climate change
210,excluded,Identification of common oncogenic and early developmental pathways in the ovarian carcinomas controlling by distinct prognostically significant microrna subsets,"Background: High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HG-SOC) is the dominant tumor histologic type in epithelial ovarian cancers, exhibiting highly aberrant microRNA expression profiles and diverse pathways that collectively determine the disease aggressiveness and clinical outcomes. However, the functional relationships between microRNAs, the common pathways controlled by the microRNAs and their prognostic and therapeutic significance remain poorly understood. Methods: We investigated the gene expression patterns of microRNAs in the tumors of 582 HG-SOC patients to identify prognosis signatures and pathways controlled by tumor miRNAs. We developed a variable selection and prognostic method, which performs a robust selection of small-sized subsets of the predictive features (e. g., expressed microRNAs) that collectively serves as the biomarkers of cancer risk and progression stratification system, interconnecting these features with common cancer-related pathways. Results: Across different cohorts, our meta-analysis revealed two robust and unbiased miRNA-based prognostic classifiers. Each classifier reproducibly discriminates HG-SOC patients into high-confidence low-, intermediateor high-prognostic risk subgroups with essentially different 5-year overall survival rates of 51.6-85%, 20-38.1%, and 0-10%, respectively. Significant correlations of the risk subgroup's stratification with chemotherapy treatment response were observed. We predicted specific target genes involved in nine cancer-related and two oocyte maturation pathways (neurotrophin and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation), where each gene can be controlled by more than one miRNA species of the distinct miRNA HG-SOC prognostic classifiers. Conclusions: We identified robust and reproducible miRNA-based prognostic subsets of the of HG-SOC classifiers. The miRNAs of these classifiers could control nine oncogenic and two developmental pathways, highlighting common underlying pathologic mechanisms and perspective targets for the further development of a personalized prognosis assay(s) and the development of miRNA-interconnected pathway-centric and multi-agent therapeutic intervention.",ovarian cancer; microRNA; prognostic signatures; oncogenic pathway; EMT; neurotrophin signaling; progesterone; mediated oocyte maturation; weighted voting grouping; meta-analysis; prognostic biomarker
211,excluded,The potential of organic fertilizers and water management to reduce n2o emissions in mediterranean climate cropping systems. A review,"Environmental problems related to the use of synthetic fertilizers and to organic waste management have led to increased interest in the use of organic materials as an alternative source of nutrients for crops, but this is also associated with N2O emissions. There has been an increasing amount of research into the effects of using different types of fertilization on N2O emissions under Mediterranean climatic conditions, but the findings have sometimes been rather contradictory. Available information also suggests that water management could exert a high influence on N2O emissions. In this context, we have reviewed the current scientific knowledge, including an analysis of the effect of fertilizer type and water management on direct N2O emissions. A meta-analysis of compliant reviewed experiments revealed significantly lower N2O emissions for organic as opposed to synthetic fertilizers (23% reduction). When organic materials were segregated in solid and liquid, only solid organic fertilizer emissions were significantly lower than those of synthetic fertilizers (28% reduction in cumulative emissions). The EF is similar to the IPCC factor in conventionally irrigated systems (0.98% N2O-N N applied(-1)), but one order of magnitude lower in rainfed systems (0.08%). Drip irrigation produces intermediate emission levels (0.66%). Differences are driven by Mediterranean agro-climatic characteristics, which include low soil organic matter (SOM) content and a distinctive rainfall and temperature pattern. Interactions between environmental and management factors and the microbial processes involved in N2O emissions are discussed in detail. Indirect emissions have not been fully accounted for, but when organic fertilizers are applied at similar N rates to synthetic fertilizers, they generally make smaller contributions to the leached NO3- pool. The most promising practices for reducing N2O through organic fertilization include: (i) minimizing water applications; (ii) minimizing bare soil; (iii) improving waste management; and (iv) tightening N cycling through N immobilization. The mitigation potential may be limited by: (i) residual effect; (ii) the long-term effects of fertilizers on SOM; (iii) lower yield-scaled performance; and (iv) total N availability from organic sources. Knowledge gaps identified in the review included: (i) insufficient sampling periods; (ii) high background emissions; (iii) the need to provide N2O EF and yield-scaled EF; (iv) the need for more research on specific cropping systems; and (v) the need for full GHG balances. In conclusion, the available information suggests a potential of organic fertilizers and water-saving practices to mitigate N2O emissions under Mediterranean climatic conditions, although further research is needed before it can be regarded as fully proven, understood and developed.

212,excluded,"Conventional oral and secondary high dose vaginal metronidazole therapy for recurrent bacterial vaginosis: clinical outcomes, impacts of sex and menses","Purpose: Oral metronidazole therapy is the standard of care for bacterial vaginosis (BV), yet it has alarming rates of recurrence and refractory responses among recurrent BV (RBV) patients. This study addresses whether high dose vaginal metronidazole therapy (HDM) is beneficial in RBV patients who fail after standard of care (SOC) therapy, whether diagnostic test scores proximal to the HDM predict clinical outcome, and whether menses, coitus, or race influences therapy outcome. Patients and methods: A total of 90 patients with RBV were given SOC and tracked 74 for up to 9 months. Refractory or recurrent patients (57) with symptomatic BV were given HDM and followed for up to 8 months. Patients were evaluated by Amsel criteria, Nugent score, and a qPCR assay that assesses the Lactobacillus content. Results: HDM achieved at least short-term remission in 68% of the patients who were refractory to or recurred after SOC and provided a 10-day increase in the mean duration of remission among patients who eventually recurred (p=0.027). Patients with prolonged dysbiosis (pH >5 or Amsel 4) before symptomatic recurrence were more likely to recur after subsequent HDM. Most recurrence happened within 10 days of menses, but sex in this cohort was not associated with clinical outcome. Mean diagnostic BV scores of African American patients in remission were inferior to scores of a small cohort of Caucasian patients in remission. Conclusion: Encouraging results obtained with HDM justify a prospective, randomized study to determine if follow-up HDM is beneficial among a broader cohort of women failing conventional oral metronidazole therapy.",nugent score; amsel criteria; LbRC; prognosis of bacterial vaginosis
213,included,Quantifying cover crop effects on soil health and productivity,"The dataset presented here supports the research paper entitled “A calculator to quantify cover crop effects on soil health and productivity”. Soil health (sometimes used synonymously with soil quality) is a concept that describes soil as a living system to sustain plants, animals, and human. Soil physical, chemical, and biological properties, along with their interactions, are required to quantify soil health. The use of cover crops in agricultural rotations may enhance soil health, yet there has been little progress in understanding how external factors such as climate, soil type, and agronomic practices affect soil and cash crop responses. In response, this dataset compiles measurements from 281 studies and provides an analysis of field-measured changes in 38 soil health indicators due to cover crop usage. Environmental and background indicators were also compiled to assess how climatic and management practices affect soil and cash crop responses to cover crops, with specific categories including climate type (tropical, arid, temperate, and continental), soil texture (coarse, medium, and fine), cover crop type (legume, grass, multi-species mixture, and other), and cash crop type (corn, soybean, wheat, vegetable, corn-soybean rotation, corn-soybean-wheat rotation, and other). An unbalanced analysis of variation was used to determine the hierarchy of most to least important factors that affected responsiveness of each soil health indicator. Based on the hierarchy structure, a soil health calculator was then developed to quantify the response of 13 parameters – erosion, runoff, weed suppression, soil aggregate stability, leaching, infiltration, microbial biomass carbon, soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, soil nitrogen, microbial biomass nitrogen, cash crop yield, and saturated hydraulic conductivity – to cover crops. The presented data in the calculator report the mean change in parameter values based on all combinations of climate, soil texture, cover crop type, and cash crop type","Soil health

214,excluded,Grass-endophyte symbiosis: A neglected aboveground interaction with multiple belowground consequences,"Most terrestrial plants form symbiosis with a large variety of microorganisms that can be major determinants of morphological and physiological host traits that, ultimately, affect the structure and function of communities. Epichloae fungal endophytes (Clavicipitaceae) are widespread symbionts of grasses that asymptomatically inhabit aerial host tissues, and confer defense to herbivores and tolerance to multiple stresses. Research on symbionts of plants has focused on soil organisms such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi, although recent studies suggest that endophytes of great agronomic interest can also generate major shifts in the belowground subsystem. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the available knowledge on the effects of endophytes on the soil. Our objective was to provide a synthesis of existing data that, comprehensively and quantitatively, evaluates the different pathways by which the grass-endophyte symbiosis may affect belowground components and processes, and high-lights gaps in knowledge relevant to agroecosystem management. The presence of endophyte was found to reduce root biomass and mycorrhizal colonization of plants. In turn, a significant stimulation of root exudates by endophytes was detected. Effects of endophytes on soil respiration and litter decomposition were not significant. No pattern was found in the response of the soil fauna to endophyte presence. Our review revealed that we still need to improve our understanding about the impact of endophytes on other mutualistic symbionts. The grass-endophyte symbiosis is a promising interaction that, like those involving nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi, may become an important tool for sustainable agriculture.

215,included,A Synthesis of Climate and Vegetation Cover Effects on Biogeochemical Cycling in Shrub-Dominated Drylands,"Semi-arid and arid ecosystems dominated by shrubs (""dry shrublands"") are an important component of the global C cycle, but impacts of climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2 on biogeochemical cycling in these ecosystems have not been synthetically assessed. This study synthesizes data from manipulative studies and from studies contrasting ecosystem processes in different vegetation microsites (that is, shrub or herbaceous canopy versus intercanopy microsites), to assess how changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 affect biogeochemical cycles by altering plant and microbial physiology and ecosystem structure. Further, we explore how ecosystem structure impacts on biogeochemical cycles differ across a climate gradient. We found that: (1) our ability to project ecological responses to changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 is limited by a dearth of manipulative studies, and by a lack of measurements in those studies that can explain biogeochemical changes, (2) changes in ecosystem structure will impact biogeochemical cycling, with decreasing pools and fluxes of C and N if vegetation canopy microsites were to decline, and (3) differences in biogeochemical cycling between microsites are predictable with a simple aridity index (MAP/MAT), where the relative difference in pools and fluxes of C and N between vegetation canopy and intercanopy microsites is positively correlated with aridity. We conclude that if climate change alters ecosystem structure, it will strongly impact biogeochemical cycles, with increasing aridity leading to greater heterogeneity in biogeochemical cycling among microsites. Additional long-term manipulative experiments situated across dry shrublands are required to better predict climate change impacts on biogeochemical cycling in deserts.",climate change; elevated atmospheric CO2; semi-arid and arid ecosystems; biogeochemical cycles; meta analysis; spatial heterogeneity
216,excluded,Modelling of co-occurrence patterns of grassland species: reciprocal shifting between competition and facilitation,"In plant community, competition and facilitation are widely studied themes across the globe however, their reciprocal shifting, if existed, requires more empirical efforts. In this study, temporal behaviour of co-occurrence patterns with relation to the nature and magnitude of deterministic control of soil, plant community and site quality factors were evaluated in grassland species of Indian arid zone. In this study, co-occurrence patterns during the three seasonal events were detected by using quantitative variable (relative importance value). Results revealed that competition among individuals was the major process during resource condition (rain) that shifted to facilitation during stress condition (summer). Soil organic carbon-soil phosphorus, diversity (Shannon index, evenness)-dominance (Simpson index), community maturity index-bare surface area were identified as major switch on and off points for such shifting, while soil moisture and grazing intensity were non-significant for such patterns. Results demonstrate that grassland species of the Indian arid region requires experimental quantification for the upper limits of significant exploratory variables.",Arid zone; Competition; Controlling factors; Co-occurrence; Facilitation
217,included,Potential of temperate agricultural soils for carbon sequestration: A meta-analysis of land-use effects,"Restoring depleted soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of arable land to remove carbon from the atmosphere and offset fossil fuel emissions is a promising strategy for the mitigation of climate change. In agroecosystems conservational tillage practices and the abandonment of formerly plowed fields (ex-arable land) are shown to have the highest potential to sequester SOC. Nevertheless reported sequestration rates vary and the effects of environmental site conditions remain poorly understood. Our results are based on a meta-analysis of 273 paired SOC estimates from 65 publications which included only mineral soils from the temperate zone. SOC stocks of ex-arable grasslands with an average of 14 years since abandonment were 18% larger compared to the SOC of arable land. Likewise, SOC stocks of never-plowed grassland plots were 11% larger than the SOC stocks of abandoned fields. The average sequestration rate was 0.72 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Semi-arid and sub-humid climate as well as low initial SOC stocks positively affected proportional SOC gains suggesting that the recovery of carbon stocks is not limited by low primary production. Therefore, the northward shift of cultivation areas in the temperate zone will lead to the abandonment of soils with high SOC recovery potential. However, if native soils are opened up elsewhere to compensate for yield losses due to abandonment the surplus of SOC in ex-arable land can easily be overcompensated by cultivation losses.

218,excluded,Biochar increased soil respiration in temperate forests but had no effects in subtropical forests,"As a climate change mitigation strategy, biochar application to soil has been demonstrated to increase soil carbon (C) sequestration and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Although numerous manipulative studies have been conducted, it is still not fully understood how biochar application affects soil respiration (Rs) and its components (i.e., autotrophic [Ra] and heterotrophic respiration [Rh]) in forest ecosystems, especially in subtropical forests. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of forest ecosystems and a field experiment with biochar amendments of 0, 10, and 30 t ha(-1) in a subtropical forest in Zhejiang, China to examine the effects of biochar application on Rs and its components. Our results showed that biochar application significantly increased Rs by 20.92% at the global scale with an increase of 20.25% in temperate forests and a nonsignificant effect in subtropical forests. Responses of Rs to biochar application varied with experimental methods and soil textures. Similarly, our field experiment showed that biochar amendment did not significantly affect Ra, Rh, and Rs in a subtropical forest in Eastern China. Specifically, the average Rs under biochar amendments of 0, 10, and 30 t ha(-1) were 2.37, 2.06 and 2.15 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively (P > 0.05). Both Rs and Rh were positively correlated with microbial biomass C (MBC) and negatively with dissolved organic C (DOC). Both apparent temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of Rh and Rs were significantly higher under biochar treatments than in the control. Our findings indicate the importance of the differential effects of biochar application on Rs in different forest types for C sequestration, which may inform ecosystem and regional models to improve prediction of biochar effects on forest C dynamics and climate-biosphere feedbacks.",Biochar; Autotrophic respiration; Heterotrophic respiration; Forest; Meta-analysis

Based on the literatures published, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate actual impact of CSRF on crop yield, soil properties and GHG emission compared with straw no-retention (NSR). The results indicated that compared with NSR, yield of wheat, maize and rice under CSRF was significantly higher by 4.11, 7.22 and 7.62% respectively; CSRF enhanced the water use efficiency (WUE) and soil organic carbon (SOC) by 14.60 and 7.59%, respectively, reduced the bulk density of 0-20 cm soil layer by 3.06%., while it had no significant effect on the SOC of 20-40 cm; For GHG emissions, the soil emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 were significantly improved under CSRF by 23.64, 12.21 and 27.34% respectively. Categorically, results on meta-analysis and regression indicated that large variation in crop yield, SOC content and bulk density in 0-20 cm soil layer, WUE and GHG emission under CSRF compared with NSR because of different straw retention mass, retention regions, and crop species. For example, the increased rate of large straw retention mass (LA) on crop yield was the highest. Adoption of CSRF under appropriate site-specific conditions can safeguard China's food security, alleviate soil-related constraints and slightly increase GHG emissions.",Meta-analysizs; Straw retention; Crop yield; Soil properties; Greenhouse gas emission
220,excluded,"Quantifying the relationships between soil fraction mass, fraction carbon, and total soil carbon to assess mechanisms of physical protection","Relationships between soil fractions (their mass or carbon (C)) and soil organic carbon (SOC) have been used to develop central ideas in SOC research. However, few attempts have been made to quantify the relationship between SOC and all soil fractions, despite the potential for such an effort to address SOC stabilization processes. We identified 41 published studies that used diverse management techniques to cause a change in SOC concentration and disrupted soil into macroaggregates (>250 mu m), free microaggregates (53-250 mu m) and free silt + clay (<53 mu m), subsequently disrupting macroaggregates into constituent fractions (coarse particulate organic matter [cPOM] > 250 mu m, occluded microaggregates, and occluded silt + clay). We used linear hierarchical models to quantify relationships between mass, C concentration and total C of fractions and SOC. Soil mass redistribution toward macroaggregates was associated with SOC accumulation, however total microaggregate mass (free + occluded) did not increase with macroaggregate mass, as would be expected given de novo microaggregate formation within macroaggregates. Instead, high SOC soils exhibited a greater percent of total microaggregates occluded in macroaggregates. Occlusion in macroaggregates was also associated with increased C concentrations of microaggregates (35% higher, SE = 3.2) and silt + clay (30% higher, SE = 3.9) relative to their free counterparts. Taken together, these relationships suggest reduced macroaggregate turnover promotes SOC accumulation via the stabilization of C into occluded fractions. Rates of SOC increase with silt + clay C concentrations failed to increase with mean site-level SOC concentration, indicating of the studied soils (median SOC concentration = 14 g kg(-1); max 68), SOC accumulation appears unlikely to be limited by C storage capacity in the silt + clay fraction. For each unit SOC gain, macroaggregates accounted for 83% (95% CI = 74, 91), and occluded microaggregates for 43% (95% CI = 33, 52), consistent relationships that have potential to be used as benchmarks for fraction-based SOC models.",Soil organic matter; Meta-analysis; Stabilization mechanisms; Carbon saturation; Particulate organic matter; Aggregation
221,excluded,Long-term presence of charcoal increases maize yield in belgium due to increased soil water availability,"The short-term benefits of biochar application on crop yield await confirmation with long-term effects when initial liming or nutritional benefits are attenuated. In this study, we determined the above-ground silage maize yield in soils under historical charcoal kilns (black spots, >150 years enrichment) and adjacent soils in southern Belgium in three consecutive years (2014-2016). Maize yield in these well fertilized arable soils was, on average, 23% higher (P < 0.05) in black spots than in the adjacent soils and the charcoal-C concentration was, on average, 2.2 g 100 g(-1) soil (63% of total SOC) in the black spots. The factor yield increase decreased with average rainfall during the growing season (P < 0.05). Water retention curves of both soil types revealed 11% higher (P < 0.05) available water content, determined between pF 1.8 and pF 4.2, in soils under black spots. The delta C-13 analysis of maize leaves at final harvest determined in one season indicated lower water stress for plants grown on black spots. Nutrient concentrations in maize leaves were unaffected by charcoal even though significant positive effects of charcoal on soil CEC and concentrations of available Ca and Mg were detected. This study shows, for the first time, that historical charcoal amendment can increase maize yield in fertile, temperate soils considerably.

222,excluded,Synthesis analysis of the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration from laboratory studies in relation to incubation methods and soil conditions,"The temperature sensitivity of soil respiration is a main factor determining the response of global terrestrial soil carbon to global warming and, consequently, its feedback on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. A data synthesis was performed to summarize information available in the literature on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration obtained in laboratory soil incubations and expressed as Q(10). The influence of common experimental variables and methods, i.e. range of incubation temperatures, length of incubation, calculation methods, and amounts of soil organic carbon, was analyzed. We found a small but significant difference between the Q(10), values calculated with different experimental methods as well as time-related trends showing an initial decrease followed by stable values. Q(10) values ranged from 0.5 to over 300 and were negatively correlated with temperature, but only at the range of temperatures below 25 degrees C. A similar dependence of the activation energy (derived from the Arrhenius equation) with temperature was observed. A negative relationship with total organic carbon content of soils was found in forest and grassland ecosystems, with an average decrease in Q(10) of 0.02 mgC g(-1) soil, explaining their slightly lower mean Q(10)s compared to cultivated soils. Because most of the observed variability remained unexplained, we emphasize the need for new approaches in future studies to the problem of understanding the temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter decomposition.

The objective of this study was to evaluate how the PE varied among different ecosystems at the global scale and explore factors that drive the direction and magnitude of the PE. Methods Using 2048 experimental comparisons compiled from 94 incubation studies with stable (C-13) or radioactive (C-14) carbon isotopic techniques, we performed a meta-analysis on the effect of exogenous organic C input on native SOC decomposition (i.e., PE) across multiple terrestrial ecosystems. In particular, the linear mixed-effect model was used to examine the relationship between the PE and potential influencing factors. Results The addition of exogenous organic C significantly enhanced native SOC decomposition by 47.5% (i.e., positive PE), with the highest value in cropland soils (60.9%) and the lowest value in forest soils (26.2%). The intensity of the PE decreased with increasing SOC content, soil total nitrogen content, soil C/N, incubation duration, and incubation temperature, but increased with increasing exogenous organic C addition rate and soil pH. Soil PE was not affected by the complexity of exogenous organic C. Conclusions Our results indicate that positive PE is a widespread phenomenon in terrestrial ecosystems, and that the magnitude is closely related to soil properties and experimental conditions.

We conducted a systematic review to assess the benefits of intentional weight loss in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD and glomerular hyperfiltration. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: We searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and conference proceedings for randomized, controlled trials and observational studies that examined various surgical and nonsurgical interventions (diet, exercise, and/or antiobesity agents) in adult patients with CKD. Results were summarized using random-effects model. Results: Thirteen studies were included. In patients with CKD, body mass index (BMI) decreased significantly (weighted mean difference [WMD] -3.67 kg/m(2); 95% confidence interval [CI] -6.56 to -0.78) at the end of the study period with nonsurgical interventions. This was associated with a significant decrease in proteinuria (WMD -1.31 g/24 h; 95% CI -2.11 to -0.51) and systolic BP with no further decrease in GFR during a mean follow-up of 7.4 mo. In morbidly obese individuals (BMI >40 kg/m(2)) with glomerular hyperfiltration (GFR >125 ml/min), surgical interventions decreased BMI, which resulted in a decrease in GFR (WMD -25.56 ml/min; 95% CI -36.23 to -14.89), albuminuria, and systolic BP. Conclusions: In smaller, short-duration studies in patients with CKD, nonsurgical weight loss interventions reduce proteinuria and BP and seem to prevent further decline in renal function. In morbidly obese individuals with glomerular hyperfiltration, surgical interventions normalize GFR and reduce BP and microalbuminuria. Larger, long-term studies to analyze renal outcomes such as development of ESRD are needed. Clin J Am Soc Neplirol 4: 1565-1574, 2009. doi: 10.2215/CJN.02250409",

This research aims to identify such strategies based on an inventory of production-ecological factors controlling the potential impact of Se fertilizers on crop performance and nutritional content. Methods The effect of agro-ecosystem properties on crop response to Se fertilization was assessed using a meta-analysis approach based on 243 experiments performed during 1960 to 2014. Results The meta-analysis confirms the high impact of fertilization as an effective agronomic biofortification strategy. Site specific properties strongly affect crop responses to Se fertilization implying the need for tailor-made solutions. However, the minor influence of soil organic matter, total soil Se levels and acidity suggests that consideration of other agro-ecosystem properties like climate and bioavailable Se measurements is also required to optimize fertilizer strategies. Conclusions Fertilization characteristics including formulation, dose and timing were found to be driving variables enhancing crop Se uptake. The highest uptake efficiencies are found for foliar and selenate based fertilizers. The current low recoveries and the scarce resource availability challenges the fertilizer approach to develop strategies that maximize the uptake efficiency of Se.",Agro-ecosystem approach; Biofortification; Fertilization; Meta-analysis; Micronutrients; Selenium
226,excluded,Costimulation of soil glycosidase activity and soil respiration by nitrogen addition,"Unprecedented levels of nitrogen (N) have been deposited in ecosystems over the past century, which is expected to have cascading effects on microbially mediated soil respiration (SR). Extracellular enzymes play critical roles on the degradation of soil organic matter, and measurements of their activities are potentially useful indicators of SR. The links between soil extracellular enzymatic activities (EEAs) and SR under N addition, however, have not been established. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis from 62 publications to synthesize the responses of soil EEAs and SR to elevated N. Nitrogen addition significantly increased glycosidase activity (GA) by 13.0%, alpha-1,4-glucosidase (AG) by 19.6%, beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG) by 11.1%, beta-1,4-xylosidase (BX) by 21.9% and beta-D-cellobiosidase (CBH) by 12.6%. Increases in GA were more evident for long duration, high rate, organic and mixed N addition (combination of organic and inorganic N addition), as well as for studies from farmland. The response ratios (RRs) of GA were positively correlated with the SR-RRs, even when evaluated individually for AG, BG, BX and CBH. This positive correlation between GA-RR and SR-RR was maintained for most types of vegetation and soil as well as for different methods of N addition. Our results provide the first evidence that GA is linked to SR under N addition over a range of ecosystems and highlight the need for further studies on the response of other soil EEAs to various global change factors and their implications for ecosystem functions.",glycosidase activity; meta-analysis; nitrogen addition; soil respiration; soil type; vegetation type
227,included,Carbon accumulation in agricultural soils after afforestation: a meta-analysis,"Deforestation usually results in significant losses of soil organic carbon (SOC). The rate and factors determining the recovery of this C pool with afforestation are still poorly understood. This paper provides a review of the influence of afforestation on SOC stocks based on a meta-analysis of 33 recent publications (totaling 120 sites and 189 observations), with the aim of determining the factors responsible for the restoration of SOC following afforestation. Based on a mixed linear model, the meta-analysis indicates that the main factors that contribute to restoring SOC stocks after afforestation are: previous land use, tree species planted, soil clay content, preplanting disturbance and, to a lesser extent, climatic zone. Specifically, this meta-analysis (1) indicates that the positive impact of afforestation on SOC stocks is more pronounced in cropland soils than in pastures or natural grasslands; (2) suggests that broadleaf tree species have a greater capacity to accumulate SOC than coniferous species; (3) underscores that afforestation using pine species does not result in a net loss of the whole soil-profile carbon stocks compared with initial values (agricultural soil) when the surface organic layer is included in the accounting; (4) demonstrates that clay-rich soils (>33%) have a greater capacity to accumulate SOC than soils with a lower clay content (<33%); (5) indicates that minimizing preplanting disturbances may increase the rate at which SOC stocks are replenished; and (6) suggests that afforestation carried out in the boreal climate zone results in small SOC losses compared with other climate zones, probably because trees grow more slowly under these conditions, although this does not rule out gains over time after the conversion. This study also highlights the importance of the methodological approach used when developing the sampling design, especially the inclusion of the organic layer in the accounting.",carbon sequestration; land use change; methodological approach; mixed; linear model; soil organic carbon; soil properties; tree plantation
228,excluded,Implications of changing from grazed or semi-natural vegetation to forestry for carbon stores and fluxes in upland organo-mineral soils in the uk,"In the UK, as organo-mineral soils are a significant store of soil organic carbon (SOC), they may become increasingly favoured for the expansion of upland forestry. It is important, therefore, to assess the likely impacts on SOC of this potentially major land use change. Currently, these assessments rely on modelling approaches which assume that afforestation of organo-mineral soils is 'carbon neutral'. This review evaluates this assumption in two ways. Firstly, UK information from the direct measurement of SOC change following afforestation is examined in the context of international studies. Secondly, UK data on the magnitude and direction of the major fluxes in the carbon cycle of semi-natural upland ecosystems are assessed to identify the likely responses of the fluxes to afforestation of organo-mineral soils. There are few directly relevant measurements of SOC change following afforestation of organo-mineral soils in the UK uplands but there are related studies on peat lands and agricultural soils. Overall, information on the magnitude and direction of change in SOC with afforestation is inconclusive. Data on the accumulation of litter beneath conifer stands have been identified but the extent to which the carbon held in this pool is incorporated into the stable soil carbon reservoir is uncertain. The effect of afforestation on most carbon fluxes is small because the fluxes are either relatively minor or of the same magnitude and direction irrespective of land use. Compared with undisturbed moorland, particulate organic carbon losses increase throughout the forest cycle but the data are exclusively from plantation conifer forests and in many cases pre-date current industry best practice guidelines which aim to reduce such losses. The biggest uncertainty in flux estimates is the relative magnitude of the sink for atmospheric carbon as trees grow and mature compared with that lost during site preparation and harvesting. Given the size of this flux relative to many of the others, this should be a focus for future carbon research on these systems.",

However, proof of a causal link between mangrove dieback and Diuron remains inconclusive. This study presents a systematic review of the evidence using Hill's Criteria of Causation. Our review shows that using concentrations of the chemical bound to sediment as a measure for biological availability in either glasshouse or field studies is inappropriate. The appropriate measure is Diuron concentration in solution and this parameter bears no simple relationship to concentration bound to sediment, and is not strongly correlated with mangrove health. Only when the herbicide is applied in experimental investigations at many orders of magnitude higher than measured in rivers has an impact on A. marina been demonstrated. Evidence from field studies suggests burial of pneumatophores, the plant's breathing roots, following flood events is a more likely causal factor in mangrove dieback, whereas any contribution from Diuron remains unproven.",
230,excluded,The relationship between sense of coherence and post-traumatic stress: a meta-analysis,"Background: Antonovsky's concept of sense of coherence (SOC) - as a global orientation reflecting an individual's feeling of confidence in both the predictability of their internal and external environment and their ability to cope with stressful and challenging situations in life - shows a negative association with symptoms of post-traumatic stress. However, single studies varying in study characteristics provide heterogeneous effect size estimations. Objective: The purpose of the current study is to investigate the relationship between SOC and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity for the first time on a meta-analytical level. Method: The random-effects meta-analysis is based on zero-order correlations (r) and consists of 47 independent samples out of 45 studies (N = 10,883). Results: After correcting for sampling error, the mean correlation between SOC and PTSD symptoms was M(r) = -.41 (excluding four outliers: -.39). However, this effect could not be generalized to all types of PTSD samples owing to substantial remaining heterogeneity. Subsequent moderator analyses investigating the influence of different SOC and PTSD measures, trauma type and duration, mean age and gender imbalances per sample did not reveal significant moderating effects. Conclusions: The meta-analysis reveals a substantial correlation between SOC and PTSD symptom severity: higher SOC levels are associated with lower symptom severity. Thus, future research should progress to the question of whether the relationship between SOC and post-traumatic stress is causal, and by which factors it is moderated.",Sense of coherence; post-traumatic stress disorder; PTSD; PTSD symptoms; salutogenesis; resilience; meta-analysis; review
231,excluded,Transtheoretical model stages of change for dietary and physical exercise modification in weight loss management for overweight and obese adults,"Background Obesity is a global public health threat. The transtheoretical stages of change (TTM SOC) model has long been considered a useful interventional approach in lifestyle modification programmes, but its effectiveness in producing sustainable weight loss in overweight and obese individuals has been found to vary considerably. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of dietary intervention or physical activity interventions, or both, and other interventions based on the transtheoretical model (TTM) stages of change (SOC) to produce sustainable (one year and longer) weight loss in overweight and obese adults. Search methods Studies were obtained from searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases. We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO. The date of the last search, for all databases, was 17 December 2013. Selection criteria Trials were included if they fulfilled the criteria of randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) using the TTM SOC as a model, that is a theoretical framework or guideline in designing lifestyle modification strategies, mainly dietary and physical activity interventions, versus a comparison intervention of usual care; one of the outcome measures of the study was weight loss, measured as change in weight or body mass index (BMI); participants were overweight or obese adults only; and the intervention was delivered by healthcare professionals or trained lay people at the hospital and community level, including at home. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted the data, assessed studies for risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). We resolved disagreements by discussion or consultation with a third party. A narrative, descriptive analysis was conducted for the systematic review. Main results A total of three studies met the inclusion criteria, allocating 2971 participants to the intervention and control groups. The total number of participants randomised to the intervention groups was 1467, whilst 1504 were randomised to the control groups. The length of intervention was 9, 12 and 24 months in the different trials. The use of TTM SOC in combination with diet or physical activity, or both, and other interventions in the included studies produced inconclusive evidence that TTM SOC interventions led to sustained weight loss (the mean difference between intervention and control groups varied from 2.1 kg to 0.2 kg at 24 months; 2971 participants; 3 trials; low quality evidence). Following application of TTM SOC there were improvements in physical activity and dietary habits, such as increased exercise duration and frequency, reduced dietary fat intake and increased fruit and vegetable consumption (very low quality evidence). Weight gain was reported as an adverse event in one of the included trials. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life, morbidity, or economic costs as outcomes. The small number of studies and their variable methodological quality limit the applicability of the findings to clinical practice. The main limitations include inadequate reporting of outcomes and the methods for allocation, randomisation and blinding; extensive use of self-reported measures to estimate the effects of interventions on a number of outcomes, including weight loss, dietary consumption and physical activity levels; and insufficient assessment of sustainability due to lack of post-intervention assessments. Authors' conclusions The evidence to support the use of TTM SOC in weight loss interventions is limited by risk of bias and imprecision, not allowing firm conclusions to be drawn. When combined with diet or physical activity, or both, and other interventions we found very low quality evidence that it might lead to better dietary and physical activity habits. This systematic review highlights the need for well-designed RCTs that apply the principles of the TTM SOC appropriately to produce conclusive evidence about the effect of TTM SOC lifestyle interventions on weight loss and other health outcomes.",
232,included,A meta-analysis of soil organic matter response to soil management practices: An approach to evaluate conservation indicators,"Increased understanding of the influences of management practices on soil properties and associated ecosystem function is needed to improve tools used to administer conservation programs in the United States. This study used meta-analysis to assess the influence of cropping systems (conventional, conservation with minimum tillage, conservation with no-till, and organic systems) and management practices (nitrogen [N] fertility and rotation length) on soil organic carbon (SOC). These factors are considered by tools that evaluate conservation performance and provision of ecosystem services. We also reviewed the literature to determine whether this approach could be applied to other proxy variables (erosion rates, soil erodibility factor [K values], available phosphorus [P], and nitrous oxide [N2O]). Data mining was used to populate a database with variables representing practices used by the Natural Resource Conservation Service's Conservation Measurement Tool (CMT) to determine eligibility for the Conservation Stewardship Program. Data collected from 55 peer-reviewed studies was categorized based on sampling depth (0 to 10, 0 to 15, 0 to 20, and 0 to 30 cm [0 to 3.9, 0 to 5.9, 0 to 7.8, and 0 to 11.8 in]). The magnitude of the effect estimated by meta-analysis was then compared to scores assigned to practices in the soil quality module of the CMT. Meta-analysis of data from the 0 to 20 cm (0 to 7.8 in) depth suggested that rates of SOC accrual were similar in organic systems using diversified crop rotations and conservation systems using inorganic fertility sources, increasing SOC by 9% compared to the conventional control. In comparisons at the 0 to 30 cm (0 to 11.8 in) depth, results from conservation systems using no-till and organic systems diverged, with conservation systems relying on no-till producing no gains while organic systems produced a 29% increase in SOC. While the use of organic amendments generally increased SOC, the magnitude of the effect was more modest than suggested by current CMT weighting. In addition, our results suggested that quality of manure, which is not differentiated in the CMT, influences the magnitude of the effect and that addition of wet manure may decrease SOC. A comparison of rotation length showed cropping systems with rotations of 3 years or longer were better able to increase SOC than shorter rotations. These findings suggested that the CMT generally ranks practices appropriately and shows how meta-analysis could be used to adjust credits awarded for use of reduced or no-till practices or different fertility sources.",Conservation Measurement Tool; cropping systems; soil management; practices; soil organic carbon
233,included,Effects of land use and forest management on soil carbon in the ecoregions of maryland and adjacent eastern united states,"The impacts of forest-related land use and management on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks have been investigated through years of primary research and review articles. This attention is justified given the importance of land use and management to greenhouse gas mitigation, soil and forest productivity, and other ecosystem services. However, there is a gap of scale and scope between site-level studies that control for sources of variation, producing high-confidence results for limited locations, and the broad reviews that offer more general conclusions. The present analysis is intended to fill that gap. Here, we focus on six ecoregions of the eastern United States, and integrate meta-analysis of published literature with synthesis of geo-referenced soil observations to: (1) test whether common land use and management practices quantitatively impact SOC; (2) identify key sources of variation in these effects; (3) assess how sources of variation translate to decisions about land use and management at ecoregional to landscape levels. Results corroborate general trends, such as O horizon SOC losses with harvesting and fire and SOC gains during reforestation, but provide greater detail about the influence of specific practices and site-level controls on SOC stocks and change in the study region. Results also show that: (1) harvest impacts depend upon landform and soil taxonomy; (2) harvesting forests that are recovering on previously cultivated lands decreases SOC; (3) tree biomass and SOC recovery increase concurrently during reforestation; (4) specific harvest, site preparation, and fire management practices affect the magnitude and variability of changes in SOC. Perhaps more importantly, ecoregional classification and soil taxonomy provide spatial frameworks for placing quantitative estimates of SOC stocks and changes in the geographic context of the study region, providing greater detail and specificity for individuals and institutions concerned with SOC management at more localized levels.",
234,included,Effects of grazing on grassland soil carbon: a global review,"Soils of grasslands represent a large potential reservoir for storing CO2, but this potential likely depends on how grasslands are managed for large mammal grazing. Previous studies found both strong positive and negative grazing effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) but explanations for this variation are poorly developed. Expanding on previous reviews, we performed a multifactorial meta-analysis of grazer effects on SOC density on 47 independent experimental contrasts from 17 studies. We explicitly tested hypotheses that grazer effects would shift from negative to positive with decreasing precipitation, increasing fineness of soil texture, transition from dominant grass species with C3 to C4 photosynthesis, and decreasing grazing intensity, after controlling for study duration and sampling depth. The six variables of soil texture, precipitation, grass type, grazing intensity, study duration, and sampling depth explained 85% of a large variation (+/- 150gm2yr1) in grazing effects, and the best model included significant interactions between precipitation and soil texture (P=0.002), grass type, and grazing intensity (P=0.012), and study duration and soil sampling depth (P=0.020). Specifically, an increase in mean annual precipitation of 600mm resulted in a 24% decrease in grazer effect size on finer textured soils, while on sandy soils the same increase in precipitation produced a 22% increase in grazer effect on SOC. Increasing grazing intensity increased SOC by 67% on C4-dominated and C4C3 mixed grasslands, but decreased SOC by an average 18% in C3-dominated grasslands. We discovered these patterns despite a lack of studies in natural, wildlife-dominated ecosystems, and tropical grasslands. Our results, which suggest a future focus on why C3 vs. C4-dominated grasslands differ so strongly in their response of SOC to grazing, show that grazer effects on SOC are highly context-specific and imply that grazers in different regions might be managed differently to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.",carbon sequestration; grasslands; grazing; grazing intensity; precipitation; soil organic carbon; soil texture
235,excluded,Meta-analysis of coronary computed tomography angiography versus standard of care strategy for the evaluation of low risk chest pain: are randomized controlled trials and cohort studies showing the same evidence?,"Background: Randomized control trials (RCTs) have established the use of Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) for the evaluation of low to intermediate risk patients presenting with acute chest pain to the emergency department (ED). However, concerns remain regarding the downstream resource utilization and the clinical impact of such strategy. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of existing studies to compare CCTA to the standard of care (SOC) strategies in the low to intermediate risk chest pain patients. We abstracted the reported incidence of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), the total number of invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and subsequent revascularization procedures, the rates of hospital readmissions and repeat ED visits. We stratified the results according to the type of the studies (randomized or not) and used random effect analysis for the studied outcomes. Results: Four RCTs and 3 case-control studies with 3306 patients undergoing CCTA and 2752 assigned to SOC were included in the analysis. Following the index visit, we observed a significant reduction in the risk of ACS (RR: 0.26, 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.87; p = 0.03) and in the rates of repeat ED visits (RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.94; p = 0.03). In addition, a trend toward less hospital readmission (p = 0.07) was noted. There was no difference in ICA (p = 0.99) but an increase in revascularization procedures (RR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.94; p = 0.01). Conclusion: CCTA use in the ED for the triage of low to intermediate risk patients reduces the risk of future ACS and subsequent ED visits for chest pain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

236,included,Carbon input differences as the main factor explaining the variability in soil organic C storage in no-tilled compared to inversion tilled agrosystems,"Conversion to no-till (NT) is usually associated to increased soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in comparison to inversion tillage (IT). However, an important and unexplained variability in the changes in SOC with NT adoption exists, which impedes accurate prediction of its potential for C sequestration. We performed a meta-analysis with pedo-climatic and crop factors observed to influence SOC storage under NT at local and regional scales, in order to determine those better explaining this variability at a global scale. We studied SOC stocks (0-30 cm) in an equivalent soil mass, climatic and soil characteristics in 92 NT-IT paired cases. A sub-base with the 35 pairs providing C inputs was used to test their effect. Greater SOC stocks were observed with NT, with a smaller difference than often described (6.7%, i.e. 3.4 Mg C ha(-1)). Crop C inputs differences was the only factor significantly and positively related to SOC stock differences between NT and IT, explaining 30% of their variability. The variability in SOC storage induced by NT conversion seems largely related to the variability of the crop production response. Changes at the agro-ecosystem level, not only in soil, should be considered when assessing the potential of NT for C sequestration.",No-tillage; C sequestration; Crop primary production; Soil C; C sinks
237,excluded,Effects of mind-body exercises on cognitive function in older adults: a meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Mind-body exercise has positive effects on cognitive performance, according to clinical observation and experts' recommendations. However, its potential benefits for the cognitive function of aging adults are uncertain and still lack systematic estimations. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the overall efficacy and effectiveness of mind-body exercises for cognitive performance in aging individuals with or without cognitive impairment. DESIGN A systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS We searched related trials through June 2018 from four databases: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO (all via Ovid), and the Cochrane Library/Central Register of Controlled Trials. MEASUREMENTS Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. A meta-analysis of comparative effects was performed using Review Manager v.5.3 software, and publication bias was examined using Egger's test. RESULTS A total of 32 randomized controlled trials with 3624 participants were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. The results revealed that mind-body exercises as a whole had benefits in improving global cognition compared with that of the control group (mean difference [MD] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33-1.51; p = .002) and were more effective than control interventions in promoting cognitive flexibility (MD = -8.80; 95% CI = -15.22 to -2.38; p = .007), working memory (MD = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.01-0.64; p = .05), verbal fluency (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.27; 95% CI = 0.09-0.45; p = .003), and learning (SMD = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.10-0.39; p = .001) on cognitively intact or impaired older adults. In dose-subgroup analysis, only moderate exercise intensity (60-120 min per week) significantly increased global cognition scores compared with those of the control group (MD = 1.15; 95% CI = 0.34-1.97; p = .006). CONCLUSION Mind-body exercises, especially tai chi and dance mind-body exercise, are beneficial for improving global cognition, cognitive flexibility, working memory, verbal fluency, and learning in cognitively intact or impaired older adults. Moderate intensity is recommended as the optimal dose for older adults.

238,excluded,Estimating the oxidative ratio of the global terrestrial biosphere carbon,"The oxidative ratio (OR) is the amount of CO2 sequestered in the terrestrial biosphere for each mol of O-2 produced. The OR governs the efficiency of a terrestrial biome's O-2 production and it has been used to calculate the balance of terrestrial and oceanic carbon sinks across the globe. However, the value used in carbon cycle calculations comes from only one study of one environment. Here we perform a meta-analysis of studies of soil organic matter and vegetation composition to calculate the first global ecosystem OR value. We use data from 138 samples across 31 studies covering 9 USDA global soil orders, 7 global biomes and 5 continents and combine this information as a weighted average based upon biome land area or organic carbon content of the soil order. Organic matter fractions could not be shown to be reliable proxies for whole soil or vegetation OR. The resulting analysis suggests that although the presently used value of 1.1 is within the range of natural occurrence, it is not the most accurate choice, representing between the 97th and 99th percentile value. Our study yields a global terrestrial OR = 1.04 +/- A 0.03. This value of OR means that the sink of anthropogenic carbon fluxes to land has been underestimated (and the sink to the ocean overestimated) by up to 14 %. Recalculating with our OR value, the fossil fuel carbon flux to land is 1.48 +/- A 0.04 Gt C/year and flux to oceans is 2.02 +/- A 0.03 Gt C/year.",
239,excluded,Assessment of the quality of meta-analysis in agronomy,"A meta-analysis is a statistical treatment of a dataset derived from a literature review. Meta-analysis appears to be a promising approach in agricultural and environmental sciences, but its implementation requires special care. We assessed the quality of the meta-analyses carried out in agronomy, with the intent to formulate recommendations, and we illustrate these recommendations with a case study relative to the estimation of nitrous oxide emission in legume crops. Eight criteria were defined for evaluating the quality of 73 meta-analyses from major scientific journals in the domain of agronomy. Most of these meta-analyses focused on production aspects and the impact of agriculture activities on the environment or biodiversity. None of the 73 meta-analyses reviewed satisfied all eight quality criteria and only three satisfied six criteria. Based on this quality assessment, we formulated the following recommendations: (i) the procedure used to select papers from scientific databases should be explained, (ii) individual data should be weighted according to their level of precision when possible, (iii) the heterogeneity of data should be analyzed with random-effect models, (iv) sensitivity analysis should be carried out and (v) the possibility of publication bias should be investigated. Our case study showed that meta-analysis techniques would be beneficial to the assessment of environmental impacts because they make it possible to study between site-year variability, to assess uncertainty and to identify the factors with a potential environmental impact. The quality criteria and recommendations presented in this paper could serve as a guide to improve future meta-analyses made in this area. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
240,included,A synthesis of soil carbon and nitrogen recovery after wetland restoration and creation in the United States,"Wetland restoration and creation efforts have been widely attempted as a way to compensate for wetland losses and to recover wetland functions; however, to date, there has been no comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content recovery at a regional scale. This meta-analysis synthesizes 48 articles to identify the general patterns of soil C and N change after wetland restoration and creation in the United States. Our results indicate that, after 11-20 years, soil C and N in restored and created wetlands are still significantly lower by 51.7% and 50.3%, respectively, than those in natural wetlands. The soil C and N in restored wetlands recovered faster than in created wetlands. Furthermore, the soil C in restored organic flat and created depressional wetlands recovered more rapidly than in restored and created hydrologically open wetlands (riverine and tidal), respectively. Mean annual temperature and soil texture were recognized as two crucial abiotic factors affecting soil C and N recovery. Linear regression analysis revealed a positive relationship between the restoration and creation effect sizes on soil C and N, indicating that wetlands may alleviate N limitations intrinsically during C recovery processes.",analysis. carbon. conservation. data analysis. effects. environmental protection. evaluation. losses. meta-analysis. nitrogen. nitrogen content.

241,excluded,Soil carbon stocks and forest biomass following conversion of pasture to broadleaf and conifer plantations in southeastern brazil,"Increased soil carbon sequestration can potentially mitigate CO2 emission and can indicate sustainable forest management. This study aims to determine the relative influence of commercial plantation tree species on soil carbon following establishment on former tropical pastures. Soil carbon (organic horizon plus mineral soil from 0 to 45 cm) and stemwood productivity were quantified from 6 to 34 year-old conifer and broadleaf plantations in a sandy Oxisol (Typic Hapludox) in southeastern Brazil. Study plots consisted of ten pastures paired with broadleaf plantations and ten additional broadleaf plantations paired with conifer plantations. Pastures primarily consisted of Brachiaria decumbens Stapf., while broadleaf plantations were primarily Eucalyptus, but also included one plot each of three other broadleaf species. Conifer stands were made up of Pious species. Average stemwood productivity (+/- standard error) was 9.7 (+/- 1.0) Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for broadleaf and 5.7 (+/- 0.5) Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for conifer plantations, but did not correlate to soil C. The soil C in the paired Pasture-Broadleaf plots averaged 36.0 +/- 1.7 Mg C ha(-1) in pastures and 36.8 +/- 1.9 Mg C ha(-1) in broadleaf plantations. The Broadleaf-Conifer plots averaged 38.3 +/- 1.9 Mg C ha(-1) for broadleaf plantations and 36.0 +/- 1.6 Mg C ha(-1) for conifers. Our results show little difference in soil C across vegetation types, providing evidence that conifer and broadleaf plantations overall maintain similar levels of soil carbon to pasture land-use up to 34 years following land conversion. Soil C differences between Pasture-Broadleaf pairs indicated a small decline in soil C accretion early after plantation establishment, followed by recovery to slightly higher accretion rates.

We analyzed US health plan data to assess the impact of fixed- versus loose-dose triple-combination therapy on adherence, clinical, and economic outcomes. Patients initiating triple therapy with an angiotensin receptor blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or beta blocker plus amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide comprised three cohorts. Within-cohort comparisons were made between fixed-dose combinations of two antihypertensives plus a second pill (two pills) or three separate pills. Outcomes included adherence, cardiovascular events, health care resource use, and costs for patients with >= 12 months follow-up. A total of 16,290 patients were matched. Patients receiving two pills were more likely to be adherent (P < .001) and less likely to discontinue treatment (P < .001) across all cohorts. Therapy with two versus three pills resulted in significantly lower adjusted risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio = 0.76, P = .005) in the beta blocker cohort only. Total adjusted health care costs were significantly lower for two-versus three-pill therapy in the beta blocker cohort only (cost ratio = 0.74 overall, P < .01; 0.71 hypertension-attributable, P < .01).

243,excluded,Mechanisms driving the soil organic matter decomposition response to nitrogen enrichment in grassland soils,"Empirical studies show that nitrogen (N) addition often reduces microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) and carbon dioxide (CO2) production via microbial respiration. Although predictions from theoretical models support these findings, the mechanisms that drive this response remain unclear. To address this uncertainty, we sampled soils of three grassland sites in the U.S. Central Great Plains that each have received seven years of continuous experimental nutrient addition in the field. Nitrogen addition significantly decreased the decomposition rate of slowly cycling SOM and the cumulative carbon (C) respired per mass soil C. We evaluated whether this effect of N addition on microbial respiration resulted from: 1) increased microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), 2) decreased microbial oxidative enzyme activity, or 3) decreased microbial biomass due to plant and/or soil mediated responses to N enrichment. In contrast to our hypotheses - as well as results from N addition studies in forest ecosystems and theoretical predictions - N did not increase microbial CUE or decrease microbial oxidative enzyme activity. Instead, reduced microbial biomass likely caused the decreased respiration in response to N enrichment. Identifying what factors drive this decreased microbial biomass response to N should be a priority for further inquiry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

244,excluded,Intergroup contact and reduction of explicit and implicit prejudice toward immigrants: a study with italian businessmen owning small and medium enterprises,"A field study was conducted to test the effectiveness of intergroup contact (Allport, The nature of prejudice, 1954) as a predictor of explicit and implicit attitudes toward immigrants and to examine the processes driving its effects. Participants were Italian businessmen owning small and medium enterprises in Northern Italy who had daily contact with their immigrant workers. We tested a model in which contact ameliorated explicit attitudes, measured as support for social policies toward immigration, through reduced negative outgroup stereotypes. Furthermore, we predicted that contact would have a direct, unmediated effect on improved implicit attitudes toward immigrants, assessed with an Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al., J Personal Soc Psychol 74:1464-1480, 1998). The results were fully consistent with predictions, thus providing strong support for the contact hypothesis at both an explicit and at an implicit level. The lack of correlation between explicit and implicit attitudes supports dual-process models, suggesting that the two types of attitudes are formed through different processes. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.",
245,excluded,Predicting gross nitrogen mineralization and potentially mineralizable nitrogen using soil organic matter properties,"Gross N mineralization is a fundamental soil process that plays an important role in determining the supply of soil inorganic N, highlighted by recent research demonstrating that plants can effectively compete with microbes for inorganic N. However, predictions of the supply of plant available N from soil have largely neglected gross N mineralization. As soil organic matter (SOM) is the substrate that microbes use in the process of N mineralization, characteristics of SOM fractions that are relatively easy to measure may hold value as predictors of gross N mineralization. To improve understanding of predictive relationships between SOM fraction properties and gross N mineralization, we assessed 32 measures of SOM quality and quantity, including physically, chemically, and biologically defined SOM fractions, for their ability to predict gross N mineralization across a wide range of soil types (Aridisols to Mollisols) and crop management systems (organic vs. inorganic based fertility) in Israel and the United States. We also assessed predictions of a commonly employed indicator of soil N availability, potentially mineralizable N (PMN, determined by 7-d anaerobic incubation). Organic fertility management systems consistently enhanced gross N mineralization and PMN compared with inorganic fertility management systems. While several SOM characteristics were significantly correlated with both gross N mineralization and PMN, other characteristics differed in their relationships with gross N mineralization and PMN, highlighting that these assays are controlled by different factors. Multiple linear regressions (MLR) were utilized to generate N mineralization predictions: five (gross N mineralization) or six (PMN) predictor models explained >80% of the variation in both gross N mineralization and PMN (R-2 > 0.8). The MLR models successfully predicted gross N mineralization and PMN across diverse soil types and management systems, indicating that the relationships were valid across a wide range of diverse agroecosystems. The ability to develop predictive models that apply across diverse soil types can aid soil health assessment and management efforts.",

However, whether the effects of slash burning on soil carbon pools (C) varied with slope position remains unknown. In this study, soils samples were collected at three depths (0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm) in three slope positions (upper, middle, and lower) one day before the slash burning and one week afterwards in a Pinus massoniana plantation in southeastern China. We measured soil physiochemical properties (bulk density, pH and moisture) and six soil C pools (total C, dissolved organic C (DOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), coarse particulate organic C (CPOC), fine particulate organic C (FPOC), and mineral-associated organic C (MAOC)). The results showed that slash burning increased soil pH (p < 0.001) and total C content (p < 0.001), but decreased soil DOC content (p < 0.001). Soil BD and moisture were not altered by the slash burning (p > 0.05). Slope position significantly affected soil moisture, DOC, MBC and MAOC. Soil moisture at 0-5 cm depth was significantly higher in the lower than upper slope position. The effects of slash burning on soil MBC varied with slope position and soil depth. Slash burning significantly decreased soil MBC at the 5-10 cm depth in the middle and lower slope position, but not in the upper slope position. Slash burning significantly decreased soil MBC at the 0-5 cm depth, while had no influence on soil MBC at the 10-20 cm depth irrespective of slope position. Averaged across slope positions for each soil depth, slash burning resulted in 48.0%, 41.3% and 25.7% decrease in soil MBC content at the 0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm depth, respectively. Slash burning had no effect on the distribution of the mass, but altered the C content in soil physical fractions. Slash burning increased FPOC (p < 0.01), but had no influence on CPOC and MAOC. The effects of slash burning on soil FPOC did not vary with slope position (p > 0.05). Our findings suggested that slope position should be considered as an important factor influencing the impact of slash burning on soil microbial mediated C pools, and future research is needed to investigate the post-fire recovery of vegetation and soil C dynamics.",Slash burning; Slope position; Microbial biomass carbon; Dissolved organic carbon; Particulate organic carbon; Mineral-associated organic carbon

Participants with tumours expressing PD-L1 on >= 1% of tumour cells accounted for approximately 40% of the total participants. In this subgroup, a benefit in progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-0.63] and overall survival (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.35-0.81) was reported. Adverse events were comparable between both treatments, but more serious adverse events were reported for durvalumab (64/213 [30%] vs. 18/90 [20%]). The ERG's concerns regarding the economic analysis included a likely overestimation of PFS for the durvalumab arm, the choice of timepoint for treatment waning, as well as the way treatment waning was incorporated in the model, and potential overestimation of utility values without applying an age- or treatment-related decrement. The revised ERG base-case resulted in a deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 50,238 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained, with substantial remaining uncertainty. NICE recommended durvalumab as an option for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund only in a subpopulation (concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation therapy) with a commercially managed access agreement in place.",
248,excluded,Soil carbon accumulation after open-cast coal and oil shale mining in Northern Hemisphere: a quantitative review,"Meta-analysis and other statistical methods were used to evaluate how changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) content in post-mining soils are related to different factors; the data were obtained from 17 studies covering 93 temperate post-mining sites in the Northern Hemisphere that had been revegetated by forest or grassland either by reclamation or natural succession. Because many studies have failed to report any measures of variance, only part of the data were used for meta-analysis. According to the meta-analysis, the rate of SOC accumulation was unrelated to vegetation type. In a separate analysis that included all available data and in which rates of SOC accumulation at each site were used as individual entries, the rate of SOC accumulation differed depending on the age of the site and vegetation type. Under deciduous forests, the rate reached a maximum after 5-10 years and then decreased. Under coniferous forests, the initial SOC values were lower than under deciduous forests, but slowly increased with age and reached a maximum after 30-40 years. No significant temporal trend was found in grasslands, probably because the data set included only relatively young grassland sites. Based on data from sites younger than 30 years, sites with grasslands and deciduous forests accumulated SOC faster than sites with coniferous forests. The rate of accumulation was negatively correlated with temperature under coniferous forests, but positively correlated with temperature in grasslands. This suggests that carbon sequestration is favored by cold climates in coniferous forests, but by warm climates in grasslands. Deciduous forests were intermediate. Compared to conifers, deciduous trees may support SOC sequestration deeper in the soil profile, which may enhance SOC stability. A large proportion of post-mining sites reach the pre-mining SOC stock within 20 years or less after reclamation.",
249,included,Can Bioenergy Ash Applications Emulate the Effects of Wildfire on Upland Forest Soil Chemical Properties?,"As efforts to combat climate change intensify in Canada and around the world, the use of forest biomass to produce energy is expanding rapidly. At the same time, there is an urgent need for environmentally sustainable methods of handling the ash generated during biomass combustion. Currently, bioenergy ash is often landfilled, placing significant pressure on Canada's waste disposal infrastructure. In some countries, however, the use of bioenergy ash as a nutrient-rich forest soil amendment is strongly encouraged. Given that forest management in Canada is often driven by the 'emulation of natural disturbance' paradigm, bioenergy ash could have potential as a management tool for improving wildfire emulation in harvested stands. We compared published values of wildfire ash chemistry with those for Canadian and European bioenergy ash and found that they are similar. We used meta-analysis to examine changes in soil carbon and nitrogen pools, extractable phosphorus, exchangeable calcium and soil pH following wildfires and applications of bioenergy ash on upland forested sites. Both wildfires and bioenergy ash can reduce forest floor C and N pools: wildfires by direct combustion of organic matter, and ash applications by an apparent increase in organic matter decay. Both wildfires and bioenergy ash applications increase extractable P, exchangeable Ca and pH in surface mineral soils. Although bioenergy ash applications can trigger larger increases in available P and pH in surface mineral soils than wildfires, controlling ash dosage rates or pre-treating the ash to slow the rate of nutrient release could attenuate some of these effects.",forests
250,included,Agricultural management impacts on soil organic carbon storage under moist and dry climatic conditions of temperate and tropical regions,"We conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the impact of changing agricultural land use and management on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage under moist and dry climatic conditions of temperate and tropical regions. We derived estimates of management impacts for a carbon accounting approach developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, addressing the impact of long-term cultivation, setting-aside land from crop production, changing tillage management, and modifying C input to the soil by varying cropping practices. We found 126 articles that met our criteria and analyzed the data in linear mixed-effect models. In general, management impacts were sensitive to climate in the following order from largest to smallest changes in SOC: tropical moist> tropical dry> temperate moist> temperate dry. For example, long-term cultivation caused the greatest loss of SOC in tropical moist climates, with cultivated soils having 0.58 +/- 0.12, or 58% of the amount found under native vegetation, followed by tropical dry climates with 0.69 +/- 0.13, temperate moist with 0.71 +/- 0.04, and temperate dry with 0.82 +/- 0.04. Similarly, converting from conventional tillage to no-till increased SOC storage over 20 years by a factor of 1.23 +/- 0.05 in tropical moist climates, which is a 23% increase in SOC, while the corresponding change in tropical dry climates was 1.17 +/- 0.05, temperate moist was 1.16 +/- 0.02, and temperate dry was 1.10 +/- 0.03. These results demonstrate that agricultural management impacts on SOC storage will vary depending on climatic conditions that influence the plant and soil processes driving soil organic matter dynamics.",agroecosystems; carbon sequestration; greenhouse gas mitigation; IPCC; land use and management; soil organic carbon
251,included,Responses of soil total microbial biomass and community compositions to rainfall reductions,"Rainfall reductions influence ecosystem processes through impacts on the microbial community. However, the response of soil microbial community and their interactions with ecosystem processes remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to synthesize the response of soil total microbial biomass and community composition to experimental rainfall reductions and the implications for soil carbon dynamics. The results showed that rainfall reductions significantly decreased soil total microbial biomass and bacterial abundance, but no significant effects on fungal abundance were observed. While, within bacterial and fungal groups, rainfall reductions only significantly influenced the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Chloroflexi, but did not affect Gram-positive bacteria (GP), Gram-negative bacteria (GN), Actinomycetes, Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and other sequenced bacterial phyla. These contrasting responses suggested that rainfall reductions had major effects on total microbial biomass but minor effects on community compositions. Further analysis showed that the direction and magnitude of total microbial biomass responses were mainly explained by the size of rainfall reductions rather than the duration. Particularly, higher decreases in total microbial biomass were observed in sites where more rainfall was excluded. Reductions in total microbial biomass were larger in forests with higher aridity index (AI) than in grass/shrublands with lower AI, and stronger reductions in microbial biomass were observed at higher mean annual precipitation (MAP)/sites with higher AI. Moreover, both soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil respiration (SR) significantly declined under reduced rainfall experiments arid had positive relationships with changes in total microbial biomass, especially in humid lands (AI >= 0.65). The microbial responses to aridity levels indicated that soil carbon in humid lands may be highly susceptible to future drought scenarios. This meta-analysis highlighted the importance of considering the size of rainfall reductions and aridity levels when modeling and projecting soil carbon dynamics.",Microbial biomass; Microbial community compositions; Belowground C dynamics; Size of rainfall reductions; Aridity index; Meta-analysis
252,excluded,"No-till management impacts on crop productivity, carbon input and soil carbon sequestration","The efficacy of no-till agriculture for increasing C in soils has been questioned in recent studies. This is a serious issue after many publications and reports during the last two decades have recommended no-till as a practice to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through soil C sequestration. Our objective was to investigate the possibility that the lack of C increase in some no-till systems may be due to changes in crop productivity and subsequent C input to soils. A meta-analysis of 74 published studies was conducted to determine if crop production varies between no-till and full tillage management. The results were used to estimate the change in C input due to no-till adoption and the influence on soil organic C stocks at steady-state using the Century model. We found that crop productivity can be reduced with adoption of no-till, particularly in cooler and/or wetter climatic conditions. The influence varies, however, and crop productivity can even increase in some regions following adoption of no-till. In cases where crop production and C inputs decreased due to no-till, the potential reduction in soil organic C stocks was offset by a decrease in soil C decomposition rates, except in cases where C inputs declined by 15% or more. Challenges still remain for understanding the full impact of no-till adoption on soil organic C stocks, such as changes on C inputs in deeper subsurface horizons, the influence of variation in NT seeding methods on soil disturbance, and changes in SOM stabilization due to saturation limits in mineral soil fractions, which may further modify net C storage in soils.

253,excluded,Spring: a method for identifying differentially expressed genes in microarray data,"Analysis of 'omics' data is a central issue of system biology. As one of the most widely used 'omics' data, gene expression profiles from microarray experiments are applied to many frontier studies. The first and important step to analyze microarray data is to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under two experimental conditions. Thereby, several DEG-identifying algorithms have been proposed. However, both traditional algorithms, such as Fold-Change, T-test and Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), and modern ones, such as Rank Product, Outlier Robust t-statistic and Outlier Sums, are statistics-based approaches with the same core idea, which considers DEGs as the differences between two series of numbers. We present a novel view based on the hypothesis that DEGs are the differences between two input modes rather than the differences between two digital series, and then propose a novel non-statistical algorithm based on this idea, named Spring (SPG), which uses a Self-Organization Map (SOM) neural network to detect the input modals of DEGs under two sets of conditions. Firstly, the input matrix for SOM is constructed by reconstruction of the gene expression matrix, amplification of the difference of DEG and use of pairs of units divided from reconstructed gene expression matrix; and then, the strategy to improve the accuracy and stability is proposed by the Mass Spring Model, Minimum Spanning Tree Clustering and fuzzy clustering matrix. Compared with T-test and SAM, our algorithm obtains more DEGs in higher accuracy from both simulation and Homo sapiens datasets. Especially, we describe the details to transform SPG to a meta-analysis algorithm at the end.",
254,included,Soil carbon stocks and land use change: a meta analysis,"Abstract The effects of land use change on soil carbon stocks are of concern in the context of international policy agendas on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. This paper reviews the literature for the influence of land use changes on soil C stocks and reports the results of a meta analysis of these data from 74 publications. The meta analysis indicates that soil C stocks decline after land use changes from pasture to plantation (−10%), native forest to plantation (−13%), native forest to crop (−42%), and pasture to crop (−59%). Soil C stocks increase after land use changes from native forest to pasture (+ 8%), crop to pasture (+ 19%), crop to plantation (+ 18%), and crop to secondary forest (+ 53%). Wherever one of the land use changes decreased soil C, the reverse process usually increased soil carbon and vice versa. As the quantity of available data is not large and the methodologies used are diverse, the conclusions drawn must be regarded as working hypotheses from which to design future targeted investigations that broaden the database. Within some land use changes there were, however, sufficient examples to explore the role of other factors contributing to the above conclusions. One outcome of the meta analysis, especially worthy of further investigation in the context of carbon sink strategies for greenhouse gas mitigation, is that broadleaf tree plantations placed onto prior native forest or pastures did not affect soil C stocks whereas pine plantations reduced soil C stocks by 12–15%.",crop; forest; land use change; meta analysis; pasture; plantation; soil; carbon
255,excluded,Agro-ecological functions of crop residues under conservation agriculture. A review,"Conservation agriculture, which is based on minimum tillage, permanent soil cover and crop rotations, has widely been promoted as a practice to maintain or improve soil quality and enhance crop productivity. To a large extent, the beneficial effects of conservation agriculture are expected to be provided by permanent soil cover with crop residues. Surface crop residues play an important role for crop growth through their benefits on soil-related structural components and processes in the agro-ecosystem, referred to in this study as agro-ecological functions. Through a meta-analysis of the literature, we have studied the relative effects of surface crop residue levels on the performance of a set of agro-ecological functions compared with a no-till bare soil, i.e., without surface residues. The selected agro-ecological functions were soil water evaporation control, soil water infiltration, soil water runoff control, soil loss control, soil nutrient availability, soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and gains, weed control and soil meso-and macrofauna abundance. The potential effects of crop residue cover were quantified using boundary line models. Our main findings were (1) 8 t ha(-1) of residues were needed to decrease soil water evaporation by about 30% compared to no-till bare soil. (2) To achieve the maximum effect on soil water infiltration, water runoff and soil loss control, residue amounts of at least 2 t ha(-1) were required. (3) The effect of increasing the amounts of surface crop residues on soil nutrient supply (N, P and K) was relatively low; the boundary line models were not significant. (4) The average annual SOC gain increased with increasing amounts of residues, with a mean of 0.38 t C ha(-1) year(-1) with 4 to 5 t ha(-1) of residues. (5) Weed emergence and biomass can be reduced by 50% compared to a no-till bare soil with residue amounts of 1 t ha(-1) or more. (6) There was a weak response in soil meso- and macrofauna abundance to increasing amounts of surface crop residues. The maximum effect corresponded to an increase of 45% compared to a no-till bare soil and was reached from 10 t ha(-1) of residues. Our findings suggest that optimal amounts of surface residues in the practice of conservation agriculture will largely depend on the type of constraints to crop production which can be addressed with mulching.",Mulch; Soil water evaporation; Soil water infiltration; Runoff; Erosion; Soil nutrient supply; Soil organic carbon; Weed; Mesofauna; Macrofauna; Conservation tillage; Meta-analysis
256,included,Critical review of the impacts of grazing intensity on soil organic carbon storage and other soil quality indicators in extensively managed grasslands,"Livestock grazing intensity (GI) is thought to have a major impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and soil quality indicators in grassland agroecosystems. To critically investigate this, we conducted a global review and meta-analysis of 83 studies of extensive grazing, covering 164 sites across different countries and climatic zones. Unlike previous published reviews we normalized the SOC and total nitrogen (TN) data to a 30 cm depth to be compatible with IPCC guidelines. We also calculated a normalized GI and divided the data into four main groups depending on the regional climate (dry warm, DW; dry cool, DC; moist warm, MW; moist cool, MC). Our results show that taken across all climatic zones and GIs, grazing (below the carrying capacity of the systems) results in a decrease in SOC storage, although its impact on SOC is climate-dependent. When assessed for different regional climates, all GI levels increased SOC stocks under the MW climate (+7.6%) whilst there were reductions under the MC climate (-19%). Under the DW and DC climates, only the low (+5.8%) and low to medium (+16.1%) grazing intensities, respectively, were associated with increased SOC stocks. High GI significantly increased SOC for C4-dominated grassland compared to C3-dominated grassland and C3-C4 mixed grasslands. It was also associated with significant increases in TN and bulk density but had no effect on soil pH. To protect grassland soils from degradation, we recommend that GI and management practices should be optimized according to climate region and grassland type (C3, C4 or C3-C4 mixed).",Grazing; Soil organic carbon; Grassland; Grazing intensity; Total nitrogen
257,excluded,"A systematic review of biochar research, with a focus on its stability in situ and its promise as a climate mitigation strategy","Background: Claims about the environmental benefits of charring biomass and applying the resulting ""biochar'' to soil are impressive. If true, they could influence land management worldwide. Alleged benefits include increased crop yields, soil fertility, and water-holding capacity; the most widely discussed idea is that applying biochar to soil will mitigate climate change. This claim rests on the assumption that biochar persists for hundreds or thousands of years, thus storing carbon that would otherwise decompose. We conducted a systematic review to quantify research effort directed toward ten aspects of biochar and closely evaluated the literature concerning biochar's stability. Findings: We identified 311 peer-reviewed research articles published through 2011. We found very few field studies that addressed biochar's influence on several ecosystem processes: one on soil nutrient loss, one on soil contaminants, six concerning non-CO2 greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (some of which fail to support claims that biochar decreases non-CO2 GHG fluxes), and 16-19 on plants and soil properties. Of 74 studies related to biochar stability, transport or fate in soil, only seven estimated biochar decomposition rates in situ, with mean residence times ranging from 8 to almost 4,000 years. Conclusions: Our review shows there are not enough data to draw conclusions about how biochar production and application affect whole-system GHG budgets. Wide-ranging estimates of a key variable, biochar stability in situ, likely result from diverse environmental conditions, feedstocks, and study designs. There are even fewer data about the extent to which biochar stimulates decomposition of soil organic matter or affects non-CO2 GHG emissions. Identifying conditions where biochar amendments yield favorable GHG budgets requires a systematic field research program. Finally, evaluating biochar's suitability as a climate mitigation strategy requires comparing its effects with alternative uses of biomass and considering GHG budgets over both long and short time scales.",
258,excluded,Albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate as predictors of diabetic end-stage renal disease and death,"Background and objectives We investigated predictive value of albuminuria and estimated GFR (eGFR) for ESRD in Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes. Design, setting, participants and measurements Beginning in 1982, 2420 diabetic Pima Indians >= 18 years old were followed until they developed ESRD or died or until December 31, 2005. Individuals were classified at baseline by urinary albumin-to-creatinirte ratio (ACR) and by eGFR, calculated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Predictors of ESRD and mortality were examined by proportional hazards regression. Results During a mean follow-up of 10.2 years, 287 individuals developed ESRD. Incidence of ESRD among individuals with macroalbuminuria (ACR >= 300 mg/g) was 9.3 times that of those with normoalbuminuria (ACR < 30 mg/g), controlled for age, gender, and duration of diabetes. Incidence among individuals with eGFR 15 to 29 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) was 81.9 times that of those with eGFR 90 to 119 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Models that combined albuminuria and eGFR added significant predictive information about risk of ESRD or death compared with models containing eGFR or albuminuria alone. The hazard ratio for ESRD associated with a 10-ml/min per 1.73 m(2) lower eGFR was 1.36, whereas that associated with an increase in albuminuria category was 2.69; corresponding hazard ratios for death were 1.15 and 1.37. Conclusions These results suggest that incorporation of quantitative information about albuminuria into staging systems based on eGFR adds significant prognostic information about risk for diabetic ESRD and death.

259,included,"A global meta-analysis of soil exchangeable cations, pH, carbon, and nitrogen with afforestation","Afforestation, the conversion of non-forested lands to forest plantations, can sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, but the rapid growth and harvesting of biomass may deplete nutrients and degrade soils if managed improperly. The goal of this study is to evaluate how afforestation affects mineral soil quality, including pH, sodium, exchangeable cations, organic carbon, and nitrogen, and to examine the magnitude of these changes regionally where afforestation rates are high. We also examine potential mechanisms to reduce the impacts of afforestation on soils and to maintain long-term productivity. Across diverse plantation types (153 sites) to a depth of 30 cm of mineral soil, we observed significant decreases in nutrient cations (Ca, K, Mg), increases in sodium (Na), or both with afforestation. Across the data set, afforestation reduced soil concentrations of the macronutrient Ca by 29% on average (P < 0.05). Afforestation by Pinus alone decreased soil K by 23% (P < 0.05). Overall, plantations of all genera also led to a mean 71% increase of soil Na (P < 0.05). Mean pH decreased 0.3 units (P < 0.05) with afforestation. Afforestation caused a 6.7% and 15% (P < 0.05) decrease in soil C and N content respectively, though the effect was driven principally by Pinus plantations (15% and 20% decrease, P < 0.05). Carbon to nitrogen ratios in soils under plantations were 5.7-11.6% higher (P < 0.05). In several regions with high rates of afforestation, cumulative losses of N, Ca, and Mg are likely in the range of tens of millions of metric tons. The decreases indicate that trees take up considerable amounts of nutrients from soils; harvesting this biomass repeatedly could impair long-term soil fertility and productivity in some locations. Based on this study and a review of other literature, we suggest that proper site preparation and sustainable harvest practices, such as avoiding the removal or burning of harvest residue, could minimize the impact of afforestation on soils. These sustainable practices would in turn slow soil compaction, erosion, and organic matter loss, maintaining soil fertility to the greatest extent possible.",acidification; afforestation; base cations; salinity; soil carbon; soil; nutrients; sustainable harvest
260,excluded,Apparent temperature sensitivity of soil respiration can result from temperature driven changes in microbial biomass,"The ongoing increase of atmospheric temperature may induce soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and exacerbate the greenhouse effect. As a result, there is a great effort to understand the relationship between temperature and the heterotrophic soil respiration rate (R-SOIL) as it has significant implications for anticipated change of the Earth system. Soil respiration depends on the size of respiring microbial biomass (MBC) and when R-SOIL is measured without concurrent measurement of MBC, the apparent temperature sensitivity of R-SOIL could be misinterpreted since MBC can change with temperature within days or weeks of warming. The effect of temperature driven changes in MBC on the apparent temperature sensitivity of R-SOIL was evaluated using a meta-analysis of 27 laboratory and field experiments conducted at different temporal scales (1-730 d) and under a wide range of temperatures (2-50 degrees C) and soil conditions. Across all studies, the apparent temperature sensitivity decreased when MBC decreased with increasing temperature and vice versa. We observed a steep decrease of MBC above optimal temperature (27.1 +/- 1.0 degrees C), which attenuated the apparent temperature sensitivity of R-SOIL, an aspect previously explained by the existence of reaction rate temperature optima. The temperature response of the MBC specific respiration rate was, however, highly non-linear and soil specific. Including MBC in soil biogeochemical models requires careful consideration of the variability of temperature-associated physiological changes of soil microorganisms. Without it, microbially explicit models cannot predict temperature induced SOC loss better than older, empirical models based on first order reaction kinetics.",Soil; Respiration rate; Temperature sensitivity; Meta-analysis; Microbial biomass; Stress metabolism; Death rate; Microbial-explicit modelling
261,excluded,The effect of c:n the relation between cue and ratios on the fate of carbon from straw and green manure in soil,"Straw and green manures are among the most important soil amendments used worldwide to provide agricultural soil with organic matter (OM). The reported improvement in soil organic matter content varies greatly; therefore, there is a need for mechanistic approaches to evaluate substrate turnover in the soil. This study compares the results of a field and an incubation experiment to follow the fate of carbon from organic fertilizers in soil as a function of the C:N ratio of the amendments. The amendments were straw (small-N, Hordeum vulgare L.; large-N, Pisum sativum L.) or green manure (Sinapis alba (M)) with additional organic or mineral fertilizers to alter the C:N ratio of the soil-substrate mixture. In the 100-day field study, C respiration was measured at defined intervals at three locations with different soil types (Luvisol, Fluvisol and Arenosol). In the incubation experiment, C changes over 300 days were quantified based on the measurement of C respiration and C amounts in the soil-substrate mixture at the start and end of the experiment. Furthermore, microbial biomass was quantified at the end of the experiment to enable an assessment of microbial C-use efficiency. In the field experiment, a significant correlation between N supply and C fate occurred at one site only (Luvisol) where retention of C from organic substrates was larger with increased N supply. In the incubation experiment, N supply and C fate were correlated significantly for both soils under study (Arenosol and Fluvisol). Furthermore, C-use efficiency was positively correlated with C retention from organic inputs to the Fluvisol in the incubation experiment, whereas the opposite situation occurred with the Arenosol. This indicated that C retention from organic inputs was not dependent on carbon-use efficiency by the microbial community under these conditions. We conclude that stoichiometric implications apply to carbon retention in soil that depend on N availability for soil microbes. In the early stages of organic matter turnover, the outcome of N availability might be concealed by the effect of chemical recalcitrance of the substrates. The length of this phase will depend on environmental conditions for microbial activity. The effect of the C:N ratio on the fate of C from organic amendments must be considered in the assessment of C management strategies in arable farming. Highlights Organic inputs to soil with a large C:N ratio lose more C in turnover than amendments with a small C:N ratio. Retention of C from organic amendments in soil appears to depend on microbial C-use efficiency and availability of nitrogen. The soil type and related environmental conditions affect CUE and the magnitude of C retention. Negative correlation between C:N ratio of organic amendments and C fate in soil must be considered in carbon management strategies.",
262,excluded,Change in cardiac geometry and function in ckd children during strict bp control: a randomized study,"Background and objectives Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and abnormal systolic function are present in a high proportion of children with CKD. This study evaluated changes in left ventricular (LV) geometry and systolic function in children with mild to moderate CKD as an ancillary project of the Effect of Strict Blood Pressure Control and ACE Inhibition on Progression of Chronic Renal Failure in Pediatric Patients trial. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Echocardiograms and ambulatory BP monitoring were performed at baseline and at 1- or 2-year follow-up in 84 patients with CKD and 24-hour mean BP above the 50th percentile and/or receiving fixed high-dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and randomized to conventional or intensified BP control. Results LVH prevalence decreased from 38% to 25% (P<0.05). Changes in LV mass index (LVMI) were restricted to patients with LVH at baseline (-7.9 g/m(2.7); P<0.02). Changes in LVMI were independent of randomization, reduction in BP, hemoglobin, and estimated GFR. A significant increase in midwall fractional shortening was observed in the total cohort (P<0.05), and was greater in the intensified group compared with the conventional BP control group (12%+/-1.9% versus 8%+/-1.5%; P=0.05). In multivariate analysis, improvement in myocardial function was associated with reduction in BP (r=-0.4; P<0.05), independently of LVMI reduction. Conclusions In children with CKD, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with improved BP control, LVH regression, and improved systolic function was observed within 12 months. Lowering BP to the low-normal range led to a slightly more marked improvement in myocardial function but not in LVMI. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 8: 203-210, 2013. doi: 10.2215/CJN.08420811",
263,excluded,Change of soil organic carbon after cropland afforestation in 'beijing-tianjin sandstorm source control' program area in china,"Land use change is one of the major factors that affect soil organic carbon (SOC) variation and global carbon balance. However, the effects of land use change on SOC are always variable. In this study, using a series of paired-field experiments, we estimated the effects of revegetation types and environmental conditions on SOC stock and vertical distribution after replacement of cropland with poplar (Populus tomentosa) and korshinsk peashrub (Caragana korshinskii) in three climate regions (Chifeng City, Fengning City and Datong City of the 'Beijing-Tianjin Sandstorm Source Control' (BTSSC) program area. The results show that SOC sequestration rate ranges from 0.15 Mg/(ha center dot yr) to 3.76 Mg/(ha center dot yr) in the soil layer of 0-100 cm in early stage after cropland afforestation in the BTSSC program area. The SOC accumulation rates are the highest in Fengning for both the two vegetation types. Compared to C. korshinskii, P. tomentosa has greater effects on SOC accumulation in the three climate regions, but significantly greater effect only appears in Datong. The SOC density increases by 20%-111% and 15%-59% for P. tomentosa and 9%-63% and 0-73% for C. korshinskii in the 0-20 cm and 20-100 cm soil layers, respectively. Our results indicate that cropland afforestation not only affects SOC stock in the topsoil, but also has some effects on subsoil carbon. However, the effect of cropland afforestation on SOC accumulation varied with climate regions and revegetation types. Considering the large area of revegetation and relatively high SOC accumulation rate, SOC sequestration in the BTSSC program should contribute significantly to decrease the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.",
264,excluded,Soil organic carbon retention more affected by altitude than texture in a forested mountain range in brazil,"Little is known about how soil organic carbon (SOC) under tropical forests is affected by altitude. We investigated the effects of soil texture and altitude on SOC retention under native forests in Brazil, by sampling two pairs of soils of coarser and finer texture, developed respectively from quartzite and mica-schist. One soil pair was sited at altitude 1060 m, and the other at 1230 m, along a mountain range. For 1060 m, the soil with similar to 36% clay contained 227 Mg SOC ha(-1) (0-1 m depth), the double of the soil with similar to 16% clay. Such effect of texture was negligible at 1230 m, where SOC stocks were 205 Mg ha(-1) for the soil with similar to 12% clay, and 217 Mg ha(-1) for the soil with similar to 21% clay. Furthermore, there were positive correlations between SOC concentrations with clay + silt contents and specific surface area for 1060 m but not 1230 m altitude, suggesting that SOC retention was affected by texture only for altitudes near 1000 m or lower. At 1230 m, lower temperatures were predominant in SOC stabilisation through slower decomposition. In addition, 65-80% of total SOC was associated with clays, indicating a high degree of organic alteration. Interestingly, at 1235 m, SOC concentration in clay fractions reached 17%, much higher than at 1060 m, strongly suggesting SOC saturation. Thus, at 1235 m the interaction of SOC with soil minerals was probably weaker than at 1060 m or lower, and so SOC stocks are more susceptible to decay.",forest soils; micromorphology; soil mineralogy
265,included,"How Does Recycling of Livestock Manure in Agroecosystems Affect Crop Productivity, Reactive Nitrogen Losses, and Soil Carbon Balance?","Recycling of livestock manure in agroecosystems to partially substitute synthetic fertilizer nitrogen (N) input is recommended to alleviate the environmental degradation associated with synthetic N fertilization, which may also affect food security and soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, how substituting livestock manure for synthetic N fertilizer affects crop productivity (crop yield; crop N uptake; N use efficiency), reactive N (Nr) losses (ammonia (NH3) emission, N leaching and runoff), GHG (methane, CH4; and nitrous oxide, N2O.; carbon dioxide) emissions and soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in agroecosystems is not well understood. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 141 studies and found that substituting livestock manure for synthetic N fertilizer (with equivalent N rate) significantly increased crop yield by 4.4% and significantly decreased Nr losses via NH3 emission by 26.8%, N leaching by 28.9% and N runoff by 26.2%. Moreover, annual SOC sequestration was significantly increased by 699.6 and 401.4 kg C ha(-1) yr-(1) in upland and paddy fields, respectively; CH4 emission from paddy field was significantly increased by 41.2%, but no significant change of that was observed from upland field; N2O emission was not significantly affected by manure substitution in upland or paddy fields. In terms of net soil carbon balance, substituting manure for fertilizer increased carbon sink in upland field, but increased carbon source in paddy field. These results suggest that recycling of livestock Manure in agroecosystems improves crop productivity, reduces Nr pollution and increases SOC Storage. To attenuate the enhanced carbon source in paddy field, appropriate livestock manure management practices should be adopted.",Agriculture; Animals; *Carbon; Fertilizers; *Livestock; *Manure; Methane; *Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil
266,excluded,Soil c and n pools in chinese fir and evergreen broadleaf forests and their changes with slash burning in mid-subtropical china,"Soil organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) pools of a Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) (CF) forest, and an evergreen broadleaf (EB) forest located in mid-subtropical, southeastern China, were compared before clearcutting, with the effect of slash burning on organic C and total N in the top 10 cm of soil before and after burning also being evaluated. Prior to clearcutting CF forest had significantly lower (P < 0.05) organic C and total N in the soil (0-100 cm) compared to EB forest with approximately 60% of the C and N at the two forest sites stored at the 0 to 40 cm soil. In post-burn samples of the 0-10 cm depth at 5 days, 1 year, and 5 years for CF and EB forests, significantly lower levels (P < 0.05) of organic C and total N than those in the pre-burn samples were observed. Compared to the pre-burn levels, at post-burn year 5, surface soil organic C storage was only 85% in CF forest and 72% in EB forest, while total N storage was 77% for CF forest and 73% for EB forest. Slash burning caused marked long-term changes in surface soil C and N in the two forest types.",
267,excluded,Consistent treatment of errors in archaeointensity implies rapid decay of the dipole prior to 1840,"We present a meta-analysis of 223 archaeo and palaeointensities spanning the period 1840-1990 and compare these data with the geomagnetic field model gufm1 (Jackson et al., 2000 Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A 358, 957-990.). We find that the principal source of uncertainty in all the data, regardless of experimental method or number of samples, is due to systematic error. This error is quantified and it is shown that the data is capable of estimating the magnitude of the geomagnetic field for the period with reasonable accuracy, but only if errors are estimated on the basis of the field strength, rather than the measured intensity. The findings are then applied to archaeointensity data from the period 1590-1840 and it is shown that the most likely behaviour of the field was a decay of the axial dipole at a similar rate to that observed since 1840. We show that underestimation of the field's magnitude can be an artefact of inconsistent error estimation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
268,included,Meta-analysis of the effects of grassland degradation on plant and soil properties in the alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,"Alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (QTP) are particularly important for both ecosystem functioning and pastoral livelihoods, but they have been severely degraded in the last several decades. There have been numerous studies on the responses of plants and soils to alpine meadow degradation across the region, but they are mostly focused on single sites and are incapable of determining a general response pattern of plants and soils to degradation on the QTP. A meta-analysis including 61 individual published studies was conducted to examine the biotic and abiotic characteristics in slightly (LDAM), moderately (MDAM), severely (SDAM), and very severely degraded alpine meadows (VDAM). The results showed that the aboveground biomass (AGB) significantly decreased (P < 0.01) by 23.17%, 31.85%, 47.24%, and 66.66% in the LDAM, MDAM, SDAM, and VDAM compared with that in nondegraded alpine meadows (NDAM), respectively. The belowground biomass (BGB) did not change in the LDAM but began to decrease with the MDAM. The AGBs of graminoids significantly decreased in all degraded-level meadows, and sedges significantly decreased from MDAM to VDAM, whereas the AGBs of forbs significantly increased except in the VDAM. The Shannon-wiener index did not change until the VDAM. Soil organic matter (SOM) declined starting with the LDAM, and the magnitude of the decrease increased with degradation severity. The change in total nitrogen (TN) was similar to the change in the SOM. Significant available nitrogen (AN) decrease began with the MDAM and significant (P < 0.05) available potassium (AK) decrease only occurred at depth of 0.0-0.1m in the SDAM and the VDAM. Soil moisture (SM) showed a significant decrease, whereas soil bulk density (BD) increased in the degraded alpine meadow. The response of AGB was significantly correlated with the changes in SOM and TN only in the SDAM and VDAM, whereas the response of BGB was significantly correlated with the changes in SOM and TN for all degraded stages. In the LDAM and MDAM, SOM and TN mainly came from the dense rooting of the turf layer, and the changes of SOM and TN thus had no correlation with AGB. However, in the SDAM and VDAM, SOM and TN mainly came from AGB and BGB, and the changes of SOM and TN were thus significantly correlated with AGB and BGB. Our results indicate that biological and biochemical processes regulate the plant and soil changes in LDAM and MDAM and that physical processes such as water and wind erosion might be responsible for the changes in plants and soils in SDAM and VDAM. Therefore, restoration strategies should be based on the processes and stages of alpine meadow degradation. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

269,included,Soil extracellular enzyme activities under long-term fertilization management in the croplands of China: a meta-analysis,"The effects of fertilization and residue retention practices on enhancing crop yield and soil productivity, have been extensively investigated in various cropping system studies. However, various potential interactions exist among system components (soil, plant, microbial). The multitude and complexity of these interactions results in variability in agroecological responses, such as the soil extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs). Using a meta-analysis of 85 peer-reviewed articles published in the past three decades, we synthesized the EEAs of four major soil enzymes (urease, phosphatase, invertase, and peroxidase), which are affected by various fertilization and residue management practices used in cropping systems of China. The combined application of straw residues and chemical fertilizers, and straw residues only significantly increased soil organic carbon (by 38 and 47%, respectively) and total nitrogen (by 26 and 57%, respectively) as compared to the non-fertilized control. Manure plus chemical fertilizer treatments showed a consistent increase in urease, phosphatase and invertase activity by 86, 34 and 37%, respectively, as compared to the non-fertilized control. The use of inorganic fertilizers increased the activity of soil EEAs involved in carbon- and phosphorus-cycling, but did not decrease EEAs involved in nitrogen-cycling as expected. The experimental duration had a significant impact on urease activity, particularly with unbalanced application of chemical fertilizers. Therefore, along with managing fertilizer type, considerable attention should be given to adopting alternative production systems and increasing cropping intensity (preferably double cropping), to enhance soil EEAs.",Cropping intensity; Extracellular enzyme; Fertilization duration; Residue management; Soil carbon
270,excluded,Validation of a milk consumption stage of change algorithm among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer,"Objective: To assess the construct validity of a milk consumption Stages of Change (SOC) algorithm among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer ages 11 to 21 years (n = 75). Methods: Baseline data from a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate a health behavior intervention were analyzed. Assessments included a milk consumption SOC algorithm and hypothesized theoretical and behavioral predictors of SOC. Results: Compared with survivors who expressed no readiness to change, those expressing readiness to change behavior for both 2 and 4 daily servings of milk reported more frequent milk consumption (P < .001), greater dietary calcium intake (P = .006), and were more likely to meet age-specific recommendations for daily calcium intake (P = .01). Conclusions and Implications: Results provide support for the construct validity of the milk consumption SOC algorithm relative to behavioral criteria. Research is needed to further examine algorithm validity with respect to theoretical predictors of SOC.",
271,excluded,A systematic review of adolescents' sense of coherence and health,"The aim of this systematic review was to describe the association between adolescent sense of coherence (SOC) and health and identify the future direction for research in this area. Systematic searches were conducted (2007-2014) in the PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Cochrane electronic databases and carried out manual searches in three scientific journals. A total of 827 original papers were found and 23 were selected. Based on the results, adolescents' sense of coherence (SOC) was related to health in terms of the adolescents' quality of life, health behaviour, mental health and family relationships by using 31 different health-related instruments. In conclusion, the use of the SOC approach for adolescents can provide a useful view of their health during this transition phase to adulthood. Due to the large variation in the additional instruments used, combining and comparing the results proved challenging. More comparative and longitudinal research is needed to increase understanding of adolescents' health in relation to SOC and develop services that support both elements.",adolescents; health; sense of coherence; salutogenic approach; literature review
272,included,Altered soil carbon and nitrogen cycles due to the freeze-thaw effect: A meta-analysis,"Global climate change may result in changes in snow cover, which may enhance freeze-thaw phenomena in mid and high latitude and high elevation ecosystems, especially in the northern hemisphere, in the future. As a common non-biological stress, the freeze-thaw process can substantially alter soil carbon and nitrogen cycles. However, a comprehensive understanding of nutrient pools and dynamics in response to freeze-thaw cycles is not available. Here, we evaluated the effect sizes of the responses of 18 variables related to soil carbon and nitrogen cycles to the freeze-thaw effect from 46 papers. Seventeen studies that reported field observations and 28 studies that reported results from laboratory experiments were included, as well as one paper that used both methods to explore freeze-thaw processes. We used a random-effects model to examine whether soil origins, effect phases (including initial and long-term effects), methods and soil horizons affect the magnitudes of the responses to freeze-thaw events. The soil sources include forest, shrubland, grassland/meadow, cropland, tundra and wetland. We used meta regression to explore possible relationships among effect sizes with freezing temperature, soil pH, soil C/N ratios and other factors. Our results suggest that the freeze-thaw process causes microbial N and the microbial C/N ratio to decrease by 12.2% and 8.5%, respectively. Soil solution dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) are enhanced by 27.5% and 373%, respectively. The freeze thaw effect increases the concentrations of NHS4+, NOT and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) by 84.1%, 29.6% and 35.4%, respectively. N2O emissions are also increased by 95.0% in freeze-thaw treatments. Laboratory measurements resulted in contrasting responses in terms of mineralization, nitrification and respiration. Freeze-thaw events promote turnover of fine roots but have no effect on the long-term aboveground biomass of grassland and heath. The results of this meta-analysis help to achieve a better understanding of the overall effects of freeze-thaw events on soil carbon and nitrogen cycles and their modulation across different environments.

273,included,Biochar and its effects on plant productivity and nutrient cycling: a meta-analysis,"Biochar is a carbon-rich coproduct resulting from pyrolyzing biomass. When applied to the soil it resists decomposition, effectively sequestering the applied carbon and mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Other promoted benefits of biochar application to soil include increased plant productivity and reduced nutrient leaching. However, the effects of biochar are variable and it remains unclear if recent enthusiasm can be justified. We evaluate ecosystem responses to biochar application with a meta-analysis of 371 independent studies culled from 114 published manuscripts. We find that despite variability introduced by soil and climate, the addition of biochar to soils resulted, on average, in increased aboveground productivity, crop yield, soil microbial biomass, rhizobia nodulation, plant K tissue concentration, soil phosphorus (P), soil potassium (K), total soil nitrogen (N), and total soil carbon (C) compared with control conditions. Soil pH also tended to increase, becoming less acidic, following the addition of biochar. Variables that showed no significant mean response to biochar included belowground productivity, the ratio of aboveground:belowground biomass, mycorrhizal colonization of roots, plant tissue N, and soil P concentration, and soil inorganic N. Additional analyses found no detectable relationship between the amount of biochar added and aboveground productivity. Our results provide the first quantitative review of the effects of biochar on multiple ecosystem functions and the central tendencies suggest that biochar holds promise in being a win-win-win solution to energy, carbon storage, and ecosystem function. However, biochar's impacts on a fourth component, the downstream nontarget environments, remain unknown and present a critical research gap.",carbon sequestration; charcoal; pH; plant productivity; soil nutrients; soil organisms
274,excluded,Antiplatelet medications in hemodialysis patients: a systematic review of bleeding rates,"Background and objectives: Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) are often prescribed antiplatelet medications. However, these patients are also at increased risk of bleeding compared with the general population, and an aim was made to quantify this risk with antiplatelet agents. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: A systematic review of the literature (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL and Google Scholar databases) was done to determine the bleeding risk in ESRD patients prescribed antiplatelet therapy. The secondary outcome was the effect on access thrombosis. All case series, cohort studies and clinical trials were considered if they included ten or more ESRD patients, assessed bleeding risk with antiplatelet agents, and lasted for more than 3 mo. Results: Sixteen studies, including 40,676 patients, were identified that met predefined inclusion criteria. Due to study heterogeneity and weaknesses in methodology, bleeding rates were not pooled across studies. However, the bleeding risk appears to be increased for hemodialysis patients treated with combination antiplatelet therapy. The results are mixed for studies using a single antiplatelet agent. Antiplatelet agents appear to be effective in preventing shunt and central venous catheter thrombosis, but not for preventing thrombosis of arteriovenous grafts. Conclusion: The risks and benefits of antiplatelet agents in ESRD patients remain poorly defined. Until a clinical trial addresses this in the dialysis population, individual risk stratification taking into account the increased risk of bleeding should be considered before initiating antiplatelet agents, especially in combination therapy.

275,excluded,Psychosocial problems among newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis patients,"We identified patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the ages 18-65 years who needed psychosocial interventions. A total of 123 patients (90 women) were asked to participate, but 19 declined and 4 dropped out early in the study, leaving a total of 100 patients (75 women) in the sample. Questionnaires used were the Epidemiological Investigation on Rheumatoid Arthritis study questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale, and the General Coping Questionnaire. Interviews showed that 46% of the included 100 patients had psychosocial problems (PSP). One third of them had problems directly related to RA. The rest had problems with their life situation in general, without or reinforced by RA. Compared to patients without psychosocial problems, PSP patients lived in more strained social situations, especially regarding personal finances and social support. More of the PSP patients were anxious, showed lower SOC scores, and also used more emotion-based coping strategies (resignation, protest, isolation and intrusion) and less problem-oriented (minimization). They also had higher scores on depression and more frequently expected that RA would negatively affect their future. PSP patients also experienced a more negative impact of the disease, a finding not confirmed by the sickness activity score judged by the rheumatologist. Thus, early in the course of RA, screening instruments should be used to identify PSP patients. Psychosocial treatment and support by medical social workers skilled in RA care should be offered.",
276,excluded,Shifting plant species composition in response to climate change stabilizes grassland primary production,"The structure and function of alpine grassland ecosystems, including their extensive soil carbon stocks, are largely shaped by temperature. The Tibetan Plateau in particular has experienced significant warming over the past 50 y, and this warming trend is projected to intensify in the future. Such climate change will likely alter plant species composition and net primary production (NPP). Here we combined 32 y of observations and monitoring with a manipulative experiment of temperature and precipitation to explore the effects of changing climate on plant community structure and ecosystem function. First, long-term climate warming from 1983 to 2014, which occurred without systematic changes in precipitation, led to higher grass abundance and lower sedge abundance, but did not affect aboveground NPP. Second, an experimental warming experiment conducted over 4 y had no effects on any aspect of NPP, whereas drought manipulation (reducing precipitation by 50%), shifted NPP allocation belowground without affecting total NPP. Third, both experimental warming and drought treatments, supported by a meta-analysis at nine sites across the plateau, increased grass abundance at the expense of biomass of sedges and forbs. This shift in functional group composition led to deeper root systems, which may have enabled plant communities to acquire more water and thus stabilize ecosystem primary production even with a changing climate. Overall, our study demonstrates that shifting plant species composition in response to climate change may have stabilized primary production in this high-elevation ecosystem, but it also caused a shift from aboveground to belowground productivity.",alpine ecosystem; warming experiment; long-term monitoring; ecosystem functioning; Tibetan Plateau
277,included,Soil organic carbon sequestration rates by tillage and crop rotation: A global data analysis,"Changes in agricultural management can potentially increase the accumulation rate of soil organic C (SOC), thereby sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere. This study was conducted to quantify potential soil C sequestration rates for different crops in response to decreasing tillage intensity or enhancing rotation complexity, and to estimate the duration of time over which sequestration may occur. Analyses of C sequestration rates were completed using a global database of 67 long-term agricultural experiments, consisting of 276 paired treatments. Results indicate, on average, that a change from conventional tillage (CT) to no-till (NT) can sequester 57 ± 14 g C m−2 yr−1, excluding wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow systems which may not result in SOC accumulation with a change from CT to NT. Enhancing rotation complexity can sequester an average 20 ± 12 g C m−2 yr−1, excluding a change from continuous corn (Zea mays L.) to corn-soybean (Glycine max L.) which may not result in a significant accumulation of SOC. Carbon sequestration rates, with a change from CT to NT, can be expected to peak in 5 to 10 yr with SOC reaching a new equilibrium in 15 to 20 yr. Following initiation of an enhancement in rotation complexity, SOC may reach a new equilibrium in approximately 40 to 60 yr. Carbon sequestration rates, estimated for a number of individual crops and crop rotations in this study, can be used in spatial modeling analyses to more accurately predict regional, national, and global C sequestration potentials.",Agriculture; Carbon; Crops; Crop rotation; Soils; accumulation rate; carbon sequestration; organic carbon; tillage; Glycine max; Triticum; Triticum aestivum; Zea; Zea mays
278,excluded,Grasslands and Croplands Have Different Microbial Biomass Carbon Levels per Unit of Soil Organic Carbon,"Primarily using cropped systems, previous studies have reported a positive linear relationship between microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and soil organic carbon (SOC). We conducted a meta-analysis to explore this relationship separately for grasslands and croplands using available literature. Studies were limited to those using fumigation-extraction for MBC for field samples. Trials were noted separately where records were distinct in space or time. Grasslands were naturally occurring, restored, or seeded. Cropping systems were typical of the temperate zone. MBC had a positive linear response to increasing SOC that was significant in both grasslands (p < 0.001; r(2) = 0.76) and croplands (p < 0.001; r(2) = 0.48). However, MBC increased 2.5-fold more steeply per unit of increasing SOC for grassland soils, as compared to the corresponding response in cropland soils. Expressing MBC as a proportion of SOC across the regression overall, slopes corresponded to 2.7% for grasslands and 1.1% for croplands. The slope of the linear relationship for grasslands was significantly (p = 0.0013) steeper than for croplands. The difference between the two systems is possibly caused by a greater proportion of SOC in grasslands being active rather than passive, relative to that in croplands, with that active fraction promoting the formation of MBC.",soil health; soil quality; meta-analysis; organic matter; active fraction; linear regression
279,excluded,Nitrogen mineralization: a review and meta-analysis of the predictive value of soil tests,"Accurate estimation of mineralizable nitrogen (N) from soil organic matter is essential to improve fertilizer management in agricultural systems. Mineralizable N refers to the amount of N in soil that is released during a certain period (ranging from 1 week to the length of a growing season). It has been estimated from increases in inorganic N during incubation or from N uptake by plants grown in a greenhouse or field. Many chemical soil tests measuring extractable organic N (EON) fractions have been proposed to predict mineralizable N. We evaluated the predictive value of these soil tests, using 2068 observations from 218 papers. Meta-analysis was used to find the best soil test, to analyse differences between field and laboratory experiments, and to determine whether their predictive value is affected by extraction intensity (% of total soil N that is extracted). The concentration of EON was positively related to mineralizable N, explaining on average 47% of the variation. It did not, however, explain more of the variation than total N. Best predictions (57% < R2 < 74%) were obtained when EON was extracted with hot CaCl(2), acid KMnO(4), acid K(2)Cr(2)O(7), hot water or hot KCl. Extraction intensity was not related to the strength of the above-mentioned relationship. Predictions of mineralizable N were significantly worse when mineralization was measured in the field compared with measurements under controlled conditions. We found no evidence of a causal and direct relationship between EON and mineralizable N. Accuracy of soil testing may improve when the current 'single soil test approach' changes to a more complex approach, which includes different soil tests, soil properties and environmental conditions.",
280,included,The long-term role of organic amendments in building soil nutrient fertility: a meta-analysis and review,"An exhaustive meta-analysis of 132 long-term (ae<yen> 10 years) studies worldwide was carried out to determine the effects of the use of organic amendments (OA) and OA + inorganic fertiliser (IF) on soil nutrient fertility. The responses of (1) crop yield [over the whole duration of the period (yield(m)) and at the end of the experiment (yield(f))], (2) soil organic carbon (OC), (3) size of microbial biomass, and (4) Olsen phosphorus (P) to OA and OA + IF compared with IF only (standard control) and no fertilisation (nil control) were investigated. The overall effect of OA alone on yield was significant when compared with the nil control, but not when compared with the standard control. Only when OA and IF were added to soils that met specific conditions (low initial fertility, sandy texture, near-neutral pH values, under tropical climate) they rendered a significantly greater yield(f) than the corresponding standard controls. The continuous application of manure caused greater relative and absolute gains in soil OC than straw + IF but did not produce significant greater yields while causing a considerable increase in Olsen P over time. The use of OA and OA + IF increased the resilience of agronomic systems over that of IF alone, as inferred from the smaller coefficient of variation of crop yield over time. We conclude that while the use of OA along with IF provides some additional benefits on yields as compared with IF application alone (especially under the above-mentioned conditions), the selection of the OA type and application rate should be carefully considered in order to maximise the nutrient use efficiency and minimise any undesirable effects to the environment.",Meta-analysis; Crop yield; Organic amendment; Inorganic fertiliser
281,included,Positive responses of belowground C dynamics to nitrogen enrichment in China,"Determining how nitrogen (N) impacts ecosystem carbon (C) cycling is critical to using C sequestration to offset anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The N deposition rate in China is higher than the global average; however, many results of N enrichment experiments in China have not been included in global syntheses. In this study, we assembled a large dataset that comprised 124 published studies concerning N addition experiments, including 570 observations at 127 sites across China, to quantify the responses of belowground C dynamics to N enrichment in terrestrial ecosystems in China by a meta-analysis. The results showed that overall soil organic C, dissolved organic C (DOC) and soil microbial biomass C (MBC) increased by 1.8, 7.4, and 8.8%, respectively (P < 0.05), in response to N enrichment; belowground biomass and litter increased by 14.6 and 24.4%, respectively (P < 0.05); and soil respiration increased by 6.1% (P < 0.05). N enrichment promoted C inputs into the soil mainly by increasing litter and belowground biomass inputs. Additionally, N enrichment increased C output by increasing soil respiration. Land use type and N addition level had different impacts on the soil C pool and on soil respiration. DOC, MBC, and litter exhibited more positive responses to N deposition in cooler and more arid regions than in other regions. The meta-analysis indicated that N enrichment had a positive impact on belowground C cycles in China. Climate played a greater role than did N deposition level in affecting processes of ecosystem C cycling. Moreover, belowground C cycle processes are determined by complicated interactions among land use type, N enrichment, and climate. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled and quasi-experimental trials with parallel comparison groups retrieved from multiple sources. Setting Acute care geriatric and nongeriatric hospital units. Participants Acutely ill or injured adults (N=6,839) with an average age of 81. Interventions Acute geriatric unit care characterized by one or more ACE components: patient-centered care, frequent medical review, early rehabilitation, early discharge planning, prepared environment. Measurements Falls, pressure ulcers, delirium, functional decline at discharge from baseline 2-week prehospital and hospital admission statuses, length of hospital stay, discharge destination (home or nursing home), mortality, costs, and hospital readmissions. Results Acute geriatric unit care was associated with fewer falls (risk ratio (RR)=0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.290.88), less delirium (RR=0.73, 95% CI=0.610.88), less functional decline at discharge from baseline 2-week prehospital admission status (RR=0.87, 95% CI=0.780.97), shorter length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference (WMD)=-0.61, 95% CI=-1.16 to -0.05), fewer discharges to a nursing home (RR=0.82, 95% CI=0.680.99), lower costs (WMD=-$245.80, 95% CI=-$446.23 to -$45.38), and more discharges to home (RR=1.05, 95% CI=1.011.10).

The investigators performed a meta-analysis of normal ranges and sought to identify factors that contribute to reported variations. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library database were searched through August 2011 using the key terms ""strain,"" ""speckle tracking,"" ""left ventricle,"" and ""echocardiography"" and related phrases. Studies were included if the articles reported left ventricular strain using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography in healthy normal subjects, either in the control group or as a primary objective of the study. Data were combined using a random-effects model, and effects of demographic, hemodynamic, and equipment variables were sought in a meta-regression. Results: The search identified 2,597 subjects from 24 studies. Reported normal values of GLS varied from -15.9% to -22.1% (mean, -19.7%; 95% CI, -20.4% to -18.9%). Normal global circumferential strain varied from -20.9% to -27.8% (mean, -23.3%; 95% CI, -24.6% to -22.1%). Global radial strain ranged from 35.1% to 59.0% (mean, 47.3%; 95% CI, 43.6% to 51.0%). There was significant between-study heterogeneity and inconsistency. The source of variation was sought between studies using meta-regression. Blood pressure, but not age, gender, frame rate, or equipment, was associated with variation in normal GLS values. Conclusions: The narrowest confidence intervals from this meta-analysis were for GLS and global circumferential strain, but individual studies have shown a broad range of strain in apparently normal subjects. Variations between different normal ranges seem to be associated with differences in systolic blood pressure, emphasizing that this should be considered in the interpretation of strain.

284,included,"Biochar amendment effects on the activities of soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus hydrolytic enzymes: a meta-analysis","The aim of this meta-analysis was to synthesize the effects of biochar amendment on soil enzyme activities (SEAs) related to carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling. Based on 401 paired comparisons from 43 published studies, the SEAs and main influential factors were analyzed in response to biochar characteristics, soil properties, and experiment conditions. Results showed that biochar additions to soils overall increased the N- and P-cycling SEAs by 14 and 11%, respectively. The enhancement of the N- and P-cycling SEAs was mainly attributable to the microbial stimulation by biochar properties (i.e., nutrient content and porosity) and soil nutrients (e.g., soil organic C and total N). The enhancement was the most significant under the conditions with biochars produced at low temperatures and using feedstock materials with high nutrient content, and biochar applications in acidic or neutral soils, coarse or fine soils, and farmland soils. Biochar additions to soils overall reduced the C-cycling SEAs by 6.3%. The C-cycling SEAs were greatly suppressed under the conditions with low and very high biochar loads, biochars produced at high temperatures and with feedstock materials of herb and lignocellulose, and biochar applications in alkaline, fine, and forest soils. The results were mainly related to the adsorption and inhibition effects of biochars and soil properties (e.g., liming effect, high biochar porosity and aromatic C content) on fungi and the enzymes. Biochar feedstock, C/N and load, and soil total N were the main influential factors on the SEAs.

Great uncertainty remains in the previous global R (s) estimates with a difference of 70 Pg C a(-1) between the highest and lowest estimates. Thus, the present study aimed to estimate the global annual R (s) and investigate the interannual and spatial variability in global annual R (s) using a semi-mechanistic, empirically-based model which included climatic factors (temperature and precipitation) and topsoil (0-20 cm) organic carbon storage. About 657 published studies of annual R (s) from 147 measurement sites were included in this meta-analysis. The global data sets from 1970 to 2008 on climate, surface air temperature, and soil properties were collected. The Monte Carlo method was used to propagate the simulation errors to global R (s). The results indicated that the mean annual global R (s) was 94.4 Pg C a(-1), increasing at roughly 0.04 Pg C a(-1) (similar to 0.04% a(-1)) from 1970 to 2008. The R (s) rate increased from colder, drier and less soil carbon-rich regions to warmer, moister and more carbon-rich regions. Highest R (s) rates appeared in the tropical forest, while the lowest ones were in polar and desert regions. The annual R (s) correlated directly with global temperature anomalies, suggesting that the interannual variability in temperature was responsible for the interannual variations in predicted global R (s). The global R (s) increased from high-latitude zones to low-latitude zones. Further studies are recommended to explore the relationship between soil respiration and vegetation characters.",soil respiration; global; latitude; temperature; precipitation
286,excluded,Systematic review: individuals' goals for surrogate decision-making,"OBJECTIVES To determine to what extent current practice promotes the goals of individuals who did not designate a surrogate while competent with respect to decision-making during periods of decisional incapacity. DESIGN Systematic literature search for studies published in English and listed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, or PsycINFO. Studies were eligible if they provided quantitative or qualitative empirical data on how adults want treatment decisions to be made for them during periods of incapacity. SETTING Primarily United States, with six other countries. PARTICIPANTS Fourteen qualitative articles, representing 11 distinct data sets, and 26 quantitative articles, representing 25 distinct data sets, providing data on the views of 22,828 individuals, met the inclusion criteria. Most of the respondents were elderly or seriously ill. MEASUREMENTS Quantitative surveys and qualitative interview studies assessing individuals' goals. RESULTS The majority wanted close family members to act as their surrogate. The most common reason for preferring family members was the belief that they know which treatments the patient would want. Individuals also wanted to reduce the burden on their families. There was significant variation in the extent to which respondents wanted their surrogates to have leeway when making treatment decisions. CONCLUSION Individuals have three primary goals with respect to making treatment decisions for them during periods of incapacity: involve their family, treat them consistently with their own treatment preferences, and reduce the burden on their family. Unfortunately, prior systematic reviews have found that family members often are not able to determine which treatment patients want, and family members frequently experience substantial distress when acting as surrogates. These findings suggest that current practice frequently fails to promote individuals' primary goals for treatment decision-making. Future research should evaluate ways to better promote individuals' goals. In the meantime, clinicians should be aware of these findings and should encourage patients to document their own goals, including their treatment preferences and their preferences regarding how they want decisions to be made for them during periods of decisional incapacity.

287,excluded,Black carbon and soil properties at historical charcoal production sites in germany,"The use of charcoal as a soil amendment is currently of great interest to sequester carbon and improve soil fertility, however, studies of sites where charcoal amendments to the soil have been made many years ago are lacking at the moment. In this study we investigated historical charcoal production sites in Germany that have not been in use for >60 years, and evaluated the effects of the former charcoal inputs on soil and vegetation parameters relative to those of adjacent, unamended areas. Surface soil samples (0-5, 5-20 cm) were taken from five sites located on extremely acidic (Siegerland, pH 3.8-4.1) and base rich soils (Eifel, pH 4.8-5.3) in species poor (Luzulo-Fagetum) and species rich (Hordelymo-Fagetum) beech forests, respectively. We determined stocks of black carbon (BC) and natural soil organic carbon (SOC = total C minus BC) as well as of soil nutrient stocks (NO3-N, P, K, Mg), cation exchange capacity and water holding capacity, and we mapped plant composition to calculate richness and evenness. The results showed that historical charcoal production sites were enriched with BC and also exhibited increased stocks of natural SOC and total N possibly due to enhanced stabilization of natural SOC by the charcoal. The availability of nitrate-nitrogen, phosphate and potassium was increased when the charcoal was added to the base rich soils and less so when charcoal was added to the extremely acidic soils. Plant biodiversity was not different between the sites of historical charcoal addition and the reference sites. We conclude that charcoal additions may increase soil carbon storage capacity over prolonged periods of time without negatively affecting plant ecological interactions over the long term.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Setting and Participants Older adults with asthma or COPD, either in primary or secondary health care and pharmacy setting. Measurements We searched the Medline, Embase, and Central databases according to the main eligibility criteria for inclusion: systematic reviews, meta-analysis, clinical trials and quasi-experimental studies; participants aged 65 and older; education on inhaler technique and reporting of disease control and exacerbation rates. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations scale for quality assessment and used a random-effect model with Mantel-Haenszel adjustment to perform a meta-analysis. Results We included 8 studies (4 randomized, 4 quasi-experimental) with a total of 1,812 participants. The most frequent type of intervention was physical demonstration of inhaler technique, training with placebo devices. Five studies showed significant reduction in exacerbation rates (pooled risk ratio=0.71, 95% confidence interval=0.59-0.86; p < .001), although effect on disease control and quality of life showed high discrepancy in the reported results, and all randomized studies revealed uncertainty in their risk of bias assessment. Conclusion All interventions seemed to improve inhaler performance and clinically relevant outcomes, but a placebo device could be the most effective. There is evidence that interventions reduce exacerbation risk in older adults, although to an overall moderate degree.

289,excluded,Determining risk for depression among older people residing in vietnamese rural settings,"(1) Background: Major causes of the burden of disease in older persons include mental disorders and neurological diseases, such as depression. This study aims to explore the prevalence of older people at risk for depression and identify the factors associated with this risk in rural Vietnam. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Soc Son, Hanoi with 523 community dwelling elders aged 60 and over. Face-to-face interviews were performed to collect data about socioeconomic status, risk for depression, health status, and health utilization. The Geriatric Depression Scale-4 items (GDS-4) was used to assess the risk for depression occurrence. Multivariable logistic regression was employed for determining the factors associated with the risk for depression. (3) Results: Among 523 participants, there were 26.4% of participants at risk for depression. The proportion of females at risk for depression (29.0%) was significantly higher than males (20.4%). Differences were found in economic status (near poor group had higher risk for depression compared to the poor group) (p < 0.01). Older adults living with spouse/partner, living in near-poor household, and suffering pain/discomfort were all more likely to be at risk for depression. (4) Conclusions: Being female, living in a near poor household, being in pain or experiencing discomfort are all factors strongly correlated to high risk for depression. These findings highlight the urgent need for additional research among Vietnamese community-dwelling older people.",risk for depression; older adults; rural; Vietnam; mental health services
290,excluded,The effects of nitrogen enrichment on soil co2 fluxes depending on temperature and soil properties,"AimThe continuous increase in anthropogenic nitrogen (N) may have a substantial impact on soil carbon (C) fluxes; thus, understanding the dynamics of soil C fluxes under N enrichment is important. Our main goal was to resolve the conflicting results presented to date and to expand our knowledge about the response of soil respiration (Rs) to N enrichment, which may be affected by the physico-chemical properties of soil and environmental factors. MethodsWe assembled a large dataset for meta-analysis, including 563 datasets on annual and seasonal Rs with N enrichment from 154 published papers at 163 sites, covering seven types of biomes world-wide. Results(1) N enrichment was not significantly related to global Rs but we found a negative relationship in forests and a positive one in other biomes. (2) Rs showed a negative correlation with the N levels in forests and croplands and a positive correlation with the N levels in deserts; heterotrophic respiration exhibited negative correlations with N levels globally, and its response was correlated with the incubation environment. (3) The response of Rs to N enrichment was also correlated with mean annual temperature and soil properties, with 15 degrees C being the threshold for switching between increasing and decreasing Rs. (4) The estimated total C flux for global terrestrial lands was 97.01 Pg C year(-1), and 1kg of N enrichment at ha(-1) year(-1) induced an average efflux of 1.33kg C ha(-1) year(-1). Main conclusionsThe response of Rs to future N enrichment should be predicted separately for each biome. The association between changes in Rs and temperature and soil properties under N enrichment makes soil C flux a more complex challenge in the context of future increases in temperature and N deposition.",C flux; heterotrophic respiration; nitrogen; Q10; soil respiration; temperature
291,excluded,Mortality among patients due to adverse drug reactions that occur following hospitalisation: a meta-analysis,"Purpose To estimate the prevalence of mortality among patients that develop adverse drug reactions during hospitalisation (ADR(In)), to examine heterogeneity through subgroup analysis and to identify system-organ class (SOC) and their causative drugs. Methods Two investigators searched PubMed, Google Scholar and related bibliography for studies reporting ADR(In)-related mortality data. The primary outcome was to compute overall prevalence of fatal ADR(In) (95% CI) using double arcsine method. We explored the heterogeneity (I-2) in its estimation based on study design, study population and data collection methods. The secondary outcomes were the pattern of fatal reactions and their causative drugs. PROSPERO register number-CRD42018090331. Results Out of 349 full text assessed, 48 studies satisfying the selection criteria were included. The fatal ADR(In) prevalence was 0.11% (95% CI 0.06-0.18%; I-2 = 93%). The fatal ADR(In) prevalence ranged from 0.03% (I-2 = 0%) in all ages to 0.27% (I-2 = 90%) in elderly population studies. Elderly studies varied for all study characteristics. Among study wards, a higher trend of prevalence was observed in 'internal medicine and ICU' (0.46%, I-2 = 51%) and 'neonatal/paediatric ward and ICU' (0.34%, I-2 = 58%) studies. The commonly involved SOC were 'gastrointestinal disorders' (28.79%), 'blood and lymphatic system disorders' (19.69%) and 'renal and urinary disorders' (13.64%). Most commonly observed causative drug-fatal ADR(In) pairs were antithrombotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induced gastrointestinal bleeding, and antineoplastic agents induced cytopenia. Conclusion ADR(In) is an important cause of mortality. Age groups and study wards have important influence on prevalence of fatal ADR(In) and its heterogeneity across studies.

However, research has almost completely ignored the magnitude of the association between the two and the stability of this relationship across contexts, populations and different forms of community participation. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the following: (a) the strength and stability of the SoC-participation relationship; (b) variations in this relationship associated with different forms of participation (i.e., civic and political); and (c) the influence of population characteristics on the SoC-participation relationship. The results showed that the SoC-participation relationship is significant, positive and moderately strong for forms of participation in the adult population and specific cultural contexts.

293,included,Geographic bias of field observations of soil carbon stocks with tropical land-use changes precludes spatial extrapolation,"Accurately quantifying changes in soil carbon (C) stocks with land-use change is important for estimating the anthropogenic fluxes of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and for implementing policies such as REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) that provide financial incentives to reduce carbon dioxide fluxes from deforestation and land degradation. Despite hundreds of field studies and at least a dozen literature reviews, there is still considerable disagreement on the direction and magnitude of changes in soil C stocks with land-use change. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies that quantified changes in soil C stocks with land use in the tropics. Conversion from one land use to another caused significant increases or decreases in soil C stocks for 8 of the 14 transitions examined. For the three land-use transitions with sufficient observations, both the direction and magnitude of the change in soil C pools depended strongly on biophysical factors of mean annual precipitation and dominant soil clay mineralogy. When we compared the distribution of biophysical conditions of the field observations to the area-weighted distribution of those factors in the tropics as a whole or the tropical lands that have undergone conversion, we found that field observations are highly unrepresentative of most tropical landscapes. Because of this geographic bias we strongly caution against extrapolating average values of land-cover change effects on soil C stocks, such as those generated through meta-analysis and literature reviews, to regions that differ in biophysical conditions.",Carbon/*analysis; *Conservation of Natural Resources; Soil/*chemistry; Trees
294,excluded,Temporal effectiveness of interventions to improve medication adherence: a network meta-analysis,"Introduction Adherence-enhancing interventions have been assessed in the literature, however heterogeneity and conflicting findings have prohibited a consensus on the most effective approach to maintain adherence over time. With the ageing population and growth of chronic conditions, evaluation of sustainable strategies to improve and maintain medication adherence long term is paramount. We aimed to determine the comparative effectiveness of interventions for improving medication adherence over time among adults with any clinical condition. Materials and methods Meta-analyses evaluating interventions to improve medication adherence were searched in PubMed in January 2019 and reviewed for primary studies. Experimental studies with a comparison group assessing an intervention to enhance medication adherence in adult patients with reported adherence outcomes were included. Two authors extracted data for study characteristics, interventions and adherence outcomes. Interventions were categorized into four groups or combinations: educational, attitudinal, technical and rewards. Four network meta-analyses were performed to compare interventions based on patient follow-up time. Medication adherence effect sizes were reported as odds ratios (OR) with a 95% credibility interval (CrI) and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to allow ranking probabilities. Risk of bias was assessed as per Cochrane guidelines. Results Data was obtained from 69 meta-analyses with 468 primary studies being included in qualitative synthesis. The four networks compromised of 249 studies in total (0-3 month followup: 99 studies, 4-6 months: 104, 7-9 months: 18,. 10 months: 94). Interventions showing success in follow-ups of less than 10 months varied across time. Significant effects compared to standard of care (SOC) were found in technical (4-6 months: OR 0.34, 95% CrI 0.25-0.45) and attitudinal interventions (7-9 months: 0.37, 0.17-0.84). Multicomponent interventions demonstrated effectiveness compared to standard of care with an additive effect displayed, particularly in longer follow-ups (educational + attitudinal + technical interventions. 10 months: OR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.27-0.88). Discussion All interventions reviewed improved medication adherence compared to standard of care. Multicomponent interventions displayed the most promising results in maintenance of longterm medication adherence. Technical and reward components enhanced adherence on a short-term basis, while educational and attitudinal interventions evolved over time to be more effective in follow-ups greater than 7 months. Sustainability of adherence to medications over time is dependent upon multicomponent interventions including educational, attitudinal and technical aspects to modify and enhance patient medication-taking behavior. Future research should focus on the most cost-effective approaches able to be integrated into routine practice.",
295,excluded,"Dynamics of carbon stocks in soils and detritus across chronosequences of different forest types in the pacific northwest, usa","We investigated variation in carbon stock in soils and detritus (forest floor and woody debris) in chronosequences that represent the range of forest types in the US Pacific Northwest. Stands range in age from <13 to >600 years. Soil carbon, to a depth of 100 cm, was highest in coastal Sitka spruce/western hemlock forests (36+/-10 kg C m(-2)) and lowest in semiarid ponderosa pine forests (7+/-10 kg C m(-2)). Forests distributed across the Cascade Mountains had intermediate values between 10 and 25 kg C m(-2). Soil carbon stocks were best described as a linear function of net primary productivity (r(2)=0.52), annual precipitation (r(2)=0.51), and a power function of forest floor mean residence time (r(2)=0.67). The highest rates of soil and detritus carbon turnover were recorded on mesic sites of Douglas-fir/western hemlock forests in the Cascade Mountains with lower rates in wetter and drier habitats, similar to the pattern of site productivity. The relative contribution of soil and detritus carbon to total ecosystem carbon decreased as a negative exponential function of stand age to a value of similar to35% between 150 and 200 years across the forest types. These age-dependent trends in the portioning of carbon between biomass and necromass were not different among forest types. Model estimates of soil carbon storage based on decomposition of legacy carbon and carbon accumulation following stand-replacing disturbance showed that soil carbon storage reached an asymptote between 150 and 200 years, which has significant implications to modeling carbon dynamics of the temperate coniferous forests following a stand-replacing disturbance.",
296,excluded,Microbial responses to inorganic nutrient amendment overridden by warming: consequences on soil carbon stability,"Eutrophication and climate warming, induced by anthropogenic activities, are simultaneously occurring worldwide and jointly affecting soil carbon stability. Therefore, it is of great interest to examine whether and how they interactively affect soil microbial community, a major soil carbon driver. Here, we showed that climate warming, simulated by southward transferring Mollisol soil in agricultural ecosystems from the cold temperate climate zone (N) to warm temperate climate (C) and subtropical climate zone (S), decreased soil organic matter (SOM) by 6%-12%. In contrast, amendment with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium enhanced plant biomass by 97% and SOM by 6% at the N site, thus stimulating copiotrophic taxa but reducing oligotrophic taxa in relative abundance. However, microbial responses to nutrient amendment were overridden by soil transfer in that nutrient amendment had little effect at the C site but increased recalcitrant carbon-degrading fungal Agaricomycetes and Microbotryomycetes taxa derived from Basidiomycota by 4-17 folds and recalcitrant carbon-degrading genes by 23%-40% at the S site, implying a possible priming effect. Consequently, SOM at the S site was not increased by nutrient amendment despite increased plant biomass by 108%. Collectively, we demonstrate that soil transfer to warmer regions overrides microbial responses to nutrient amendment and weakens soil carbon sequestration.",
297,included,Earthworm abundance and functional group diversity regulate plant litter decay and soil organic carbon level: A global meta-analysis,"A previous review of earthworm impacts on greenhouse-gas emissions concluded that earthworms elevated soil CO2 emissions with no apparent influence on soil organic carbon (SOC), especially in laboratory incubations and in agroecosystems. This conclusion suggests that the elevated soil CO2 emissions may come from enhanced plant litter decomposition. Despite the known important role of earthworms on regulating ecosystem processes, a quantitative analysis of the relationship between earthworms and decomposition in global terrestrial ecosystems is still missing. Here, we present a quantitative synthesis of earthworm effects on plant litter decomposition and SOC based on 340 observations from 69 independent studies. We found a positive correlation between earthworm density and the rate of plant litter decay, and that the presence of earthworms doubled the amount of litter mass loss on average. The presence of all three (anecic, epigeic and endogeic) earthworm functional groups was associated with higher litter mass loss than when either one or two functional groups were present. Anecic earthworms caused the strongest effect on litter mass loss, followed by epigeic earthworms, and there was no apparent influence by endogeic worms. Although the effect of earthworms on SOC was not significant based on all observations, the presence of any two of the three functional groups alone or two (epigeic and endogeic, or anecic and endogeic) and three (anecic, epigeic and endogeic) functional groups together decreased SOC concentrations. Our results indicate that the effect of earthworms on litter and SOC decay depends strongly on earthworm functional groups and diversity, and that a high diversity of earthworm functional groups accelerates litter mass loss and SOC decay. We anticipate that changes in land management practices are likely to alter ecosystem carbon cycling through alteration of earthworm abundance and diversity.",Anecic worms; Endogeic worms; Epigeic worms; Forest floor mass; Litter; decomposition; Soil carbon
298,included,A synthetic analysis of livestock manure substitution effects on organic carbon changes in China's arable topsoil,"Application of livestock manure has been recognized as an important strategy for enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. However, the magnitude of manure application impacts on SOC changes as compared with conventional mineral fertilizers still needs to be better assessed. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to address the effects of various fertilization practices on SOC changes in China's arable topsoil. The analysis was based on 148 peer reviewed articles reporting 69 sites and 729 observations with an average experimental duration of 18 years across China. We compared the response of SOC content to application of manure alone (M) or manure plus mineral fertilizers (NPKM) with the SOC response to NPK or no fertilizers (Control). We systematically analyzed how SOC responses were influenced by different environmental and management factors (land use, climate and soil properties, etc.). First, the retention coefficient of manure was used to present the percentage of C input from manure ""converted"" to SOC. Compared to Control, on average, manure had C-retention coefficients of 31% +/- 12% (95% Confidence Interval, CI) and 18% +/- 2% for the experimental duration of <= 10 years and > 10 years, respectively. When compared to NPK, manure had C-retention coefficients of 29% +/- 13% and 9% +/- 3% for the experimental duration of <= 10 years and > 10 years, respectively. In addition, compared to Control and NPK, application of manure increased SOC content by 0.23-0.26 and 0.18-0.19 g kg(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The results also indicated that the mean differences of SOC change between the treatments with or without manure application were mainly controlled by soil properties (28-43%) and anthropogenic farming practices (21-27%). Our results highlight the significance of improving or maintaining SOC stocks by manure applications, and provide insights for making manure application recommendations or guidelines to improve SOC stocks of China's cropland based on soil properties, climatic conditions and management practices.",Soil organic carbon; Manure; Mineral fertilizer; China's cropland; Meta-analysis
299,excluded,Why does rainfall affect the trend in soil carbon after converting pastures to forests? A possible explanation based on nitrogen dynamics,"When trees are planted onto former pastures, soil carbon stocks typically either remain constant or decrease, with decreases more common in regions with higher rainfall. We conducted a modelling analysis to assess whether those changes in soil carbon, especially the interaction with rainfall, could be understood through consideration of nitrogen balances. The study was based on simulations with the whole-system ecophysiological model CenW which allowed explicit modelling of both carbon and nitrogen pools and their fluxes through plants and soil organic matter. We found that in a modelled coniferous forest without excess water input, total system nitrogen stocks remained similar to pre-forestation values because there were few pathways for nitrogen losses, and without biological nitrogen fixation or fertiliser inputs, gains were restricted to small inputs from atmospheric deposition. However, tree biomass and the litter layer accumulated considerable amounts of nitrogen. This accumulation of nitrogen came at the expense of depleting soil nitrogen stocks. With the change from input of grass litter that is low in lignin to forest litter with higher lignin concentration, organic-matter C:N ratios increased so that more carbon could be stored per unit of soil nitrogen which partly negated the effect of reduced nitrogen stocks. The increase in C:N ratios was initially confined to the surface litter layer because of slow transfer of material to the mineral soil. Over a period of decades, soil C:N ratios eventually increased in the soil as well. Simulations with different amounts of precipitation showed that greater amounts of nitrogen were leached from systems where water supply exceeded the plants' requirements. Reduced nitrogen stocks then caused a subsequent reduction in soil organic carbon stocks. These simulations thus provided a consistent explanation for the observation of greater losses of soil organic carbon in high-rainfall systems after converting pastures to forests. More generally, the simulations showed that explicit modelling of the nitrogen cycle can put important constraints on possible changes in soil-carbon stocks that may occur after land-use change.

We identified 18 trials with 23,215 and 21,986 hypertensive patients in the intervention (ie, strict blood pressure [BP] lowering or add-on treatment) and reference groups, respectively (mean age, 65 years; follow-up duration, 3.2 years). Analysis was performed through 1) first subgroup: eight trials that compared active antihypertensive treatment with placebo or intensive with less intensive BP control and 2) second subgroup: 10 trials that compared different antihypertensive treatments. In the first subgroup analysis, BP was reduced from 160.3/87.3 mm Hg to 140.2/78.4 mm Hg in the intervention group with a -6.7/-2.2 mm Hg (P < .001) greater BP reduction than the reference group. Compared with the reference group, the intervention group had a lower risk of composite CVD events (odd ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.81), myocardial infarction (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63-1.0), stroke (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.63-0.80), and CVD mortality (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.97; all P <= .05). In the second subgroup analysis, no difference was found for any outcome between renin-angiotensin blockers and calcium-channel blockers or diuretics. The meta-regression line among the 18 trials indicated that a 10 mm Hg reduction in systolic BP was associated with a reduced risk for composite CVD events (-39.5%) and stroke (-30.0%). Our meta-analysis shows a benefit when a BP target of less than 140/80 mm Hg is achieved in Asian hypertensives.

301,excluded,Impacts of an invasive plant are fundamentally altered by a co-occurring forest disturbance,"Invasive species frequently co-occur with other disturbances, which can impact the same ecosystem functions as the invader. Yet invasion studies rarely control for the presence of these other disturbances, although their overlapping effects may influence the direction and magnitude of impacts attributed to the invader alone. Here, we ask whether controlling for the presence of a co-occurring disturbance, as well as the time since disturbance, yields different values of an invader's ecosystem effects than when these factors remain unaddressed. We used a chronosequence of six forest stands at a single site: five logged stands that each contained paired invaded-uninvaded plots of the forest understory invasive grass Microstegium vimineum, as well as one unlogged and uninvaded control stand. By controlling for the presence of both logging and invasion, we untangled the effects of each through time. We found that the co-occurring disturbance of logging can dramatically alter the measured effects of M. vimineum by amplifying, dampening, negating, or entirely reversing the direction of the invader's impacts. During its period of peak impact, logging amplified the invader's positive effect on the size of the soil microbial biomass pool by 24%, reduced the invader's positive effect on soil water holding capacity by 5%, negated the invader's positive effect on the particulate organic matter carbon pool (from a 9% increase to no significant effect), and reversed the direction of the invader's impact on net nitrogen mineralization rate from a 51% increase to a 52% decrease. Furthermore, the influence of logging on the invader's impacts was not static, but dynamic through time. The results from our site therefore demonstrate that failure to account for the impacts of a co-occurring disturbance, as well as the time since disturbance, can result in flawed inference about the nature of an invader's effects. Future research should determine how widespread such flawed inference might be among other invasive species and across different environmental contexts. To help guide such research, we describe a general framework for disentangling the overlapping effects of invasions and co-occurring disturbances through time.",ecosystem impacts; forest invasion; disturbance; invasive species; Microstegium vimineum; nitrogen cycling; recovery; soil carbon; time since invasion
302,excluded,Exclusion of older adults from ongoing clinical trials on low back pain: a review of the who trial registry database,"Background/ObjectivesThe burden of low back pain (LBP) is high, especially for older adults who experience a higher number of years living with a disability. However, this population is not being well represented in clinical trials (CTs). This study analyzed the International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP) database from the World Health Organization to verify the future trend in the participation of older adults in registered CTs on LBP. DesignWe performed a cross-sectional review of the ICTRP searching for prospective protocols planning interventions for LBP with registration dates from January 2015 through November 2018. From the protocols of the eligible studies, we extracted those planning to include older adults. ResultsA total of 167 protocols for CTs for LBP were planning to recruit participants older than 65 years. However, only five registries (2.99%; pooled sample = 169 participants) were designed to target participants specifically older than 65 years. The exclusion of older participants was not justified and imposed through an arbitrary upper-age limit in 93.6% of the protocols. Most of the protocols are from single-center studies, and a greater number are planned to be carried out in developed regions. Higher interest was in pharmacologic interventions, devices/technology, and physical rehabilitation. ConclusionOlder adults with LBP will continue to be underinvestigated in CTs for LBP in the near future. In general, ongoing trials are small, planned in developed regions, and proposing pharmacologic interventions to deal with LBP.

Woody above,,round biomass was determined from dendrometric Surveys and the use of alloinetric equations. The litter was sampled as well as the underlying soil in layers 10 cm thick down to 50 cm depth. The plantations under study were C sinks over the 50 year period, since they accumulated 75 Mg center dot ha(-1) during this period, with the highest rate of C accumulation occurring in the woody aboveground vegetation between 10 and 35 years. The soil at 0-30 cm depth was a C source, mainly until the plantations reached 22 years of age, with an annual loss of 0.8% over 50 years. No difference was observed among the controls and site-preparation treatments. These results suggest that 22-year-old white Spruce plantations, the oldest considered for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012), would be a small C sink (12 Mg center dot ha(-1)) ill southeastern Quebec but Would become a larger sink for subsequent commitment periods.",
305,excluded,Soil organic carbon changes in landscape units of Belgium between 1960 and 2000 with reference to 1990,"The present study quantifies changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in Belgium between 1960, 1990 and 2000 for 289 spatially explicit land units with unique soil association and land-use type, termed landscape units (LSU). The SOC stocks are derived from multiple nonstandardized sets of field measurements up to a depth of 30 cm. Approximately half of the LSU show an increase in SOC between 1960 and 2000. The significant increases occur mainly in soils of grassland LSU in northern Belgium. Significant decreases are observed on loamy cropland soils. Although the largest SOC gains are observed for LSU under forest (22 t C ha(-1) for coniferous and 29 t C ha(-1) for broadleaf and mixed forest in the upper 30 cm of soil), significant changes are rare because of large variability. Because the number of available measurements is very high for agricultural land, most significant changes occur under cropland and grassland, but the corresponding average SOC change is smaller than for forests (9 t C ha(-1) increase for grassland and 1 t C ha(-1) decrease for cropland). The 1990 data for agricultural LSU show that the SOC changes between 1960 and 2000 are not linear. Most agricultural LSU show a higher SOC stock in 1990 than in 2000, especially in northern Belgium. The observed temporal and spatial patterns can be explained by a change in manure application intensity. SOC stock changes caused by land-use change are estimated. The SOC change over time is derived from observed differences between SOC stocks in space. Because SOC stocks are continuously influenced by a number of external factors, mainly land-use history and current land management and climate, this approach gives only an approximate estimate whose validity is limited to these conditions.",
306,excluded,Recombinant human bmp-2 for the treatment of open tibial fractures,"Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) improves healing of open tibial fractures treated with intramedullary nail fixation. However, routine use has not occurred. The purposes of the current study were to provide a systematic review of the literature using rhBMP-2 in the treatment of acute open tibial fractures treated with intramedullary nail fixation and to provide a meta-analysis of the randomized, controlled trials. Multiple databases, reference lists of relative articles, and main orthopedic journals were searched. The basic information and major results were compared. Four studies with a total of 609 patients were included. The secondary intervention rate in the standard-of-care (SOC) group was significantly higher than in the rhBMP-2 combined with absorbable collagen sponge (rhBMP-2/ACS) group (27.1% vs 17.5%, respectively; P<.01). The treatment failure rate in the SOC group was significantly higher (34.3% vs. 21.4%, respectively; P<.01). No significant differences were found in infection rate, hardware failure rate, fracture healing rate at 20 weeks, and postoperative pain level. For patients treated with reamed intramedullary nail fixation, only the treatment failure rate in the SOC group was significantly higher (21.5% vs 14.2%, respectively; P=.02); no other significant difference was observed. Adding rhBMP-2 to the treatment of Gustilo-Anderson grade IIIA and B open tibial fractures led to net savings of approximately $6000 per case. Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 added to intramedullary nail fixation of open tibial fractures could reduce the frequency of secondary interventions and total health care costs. For reamed patients, adding rhBMP-2 reduced treatment failure. This analysis supports the clinical efficacy of rhBMP-2/ACS for the treatment of these severe fractures.",

By synthesizing data from multiple studies on grazed NGP ecosystems, we quantified the response of 30 variables to C and N pools and fluxes to grazing using a comprehensive meta-analysis method. Results showed that grazing enhanced soil C (5.2 +/- 4.6% relative) and N (11.3 +/- 9.1%) pools in the top layer, stimulated litter decomposition (26.8 +/- 18.4%) and soil N mineralization (22.3 +/- 18.4%) and enhanced soil NH4+ (51.5 +/- 42.9%) and NO3-(47.5 +/- 20.7%) concentrations. Our results indicate that the NGP grasslands have sequestered C and N in the past 70 to 80 years, recovering C and N lost during a period of widespread grassland deterioration that occurred in the first half of the 20th century. Sustainable grazing management employed after this deterioration has acted as a critical factor for C and N amelioration of degraded NGP grasslands and about 5.84 Mg Cha(-1) CO2-equivalent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions has been offset by these grassland soils.",Agriculture; Animals; *Carbon Cycle; Conservation of Natural Resources; *Grassland; Herbivory; *Nitrogen Cycle; United States
308,excluded,Biochar amendment reduced greenhouse gas intensities in the rice-wheat rotation system: six-year field observation and meta-analysis,"Biochar amendment to cropland has been recommended as a potential strategy to mitigate climate change. However, estimations of the long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, namely, the methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) mitigation potential, from agricultural systems are limited. Here, a six-year field experiment was conducted to simultaneously monitor the CH4 and N2O emissions and the yield from a rice-wheat rotation system with nitrogen application (0 and 250 kg ha(-1)) and biochar incorporation (0, 20 and 40 t ha(-1)) in southeastern China. The results showed that nitrogen application significantly increased CH4 and N2O emissions and the yield compared to the control, while no significant differences were detected among the treatments with no nitrogen. In contrast, biochar amendment resulted in significant decreases in CH4 and N2O emissions by 11.2-17.5% and 19.5-26.3%, respectively, with increases in yield by 7.9-9.2%, on average. In addition, considering the GHG emissions, the soil organic carbon sequestration rate and the yield, biochar significantly decreased the net global warming potential and greenhouse gas intensity over the six-year observation period. Our results were further supported by a meta-analysis, which showed that biochar amendment in the field strongly decreased CH4 and N2O emissions by 9.3% and 18.7%, respectively, and increased the yield by 9.0% under various complex soil environments. Based on our results, biochar application would increase carbon stock by 10.3% and decrease GHG emissions by 10.4% for Chinese rice and wheat production. Our findings suggest that the application of biochar to cropland is a viable option to combat climate change over the long term by soil carbon sequestration and GHG mitigation.",biochar; methane; nitrous oxide; rice-wheat rotation system; meta-analysis; mitigation
309,excluded,Soil microbial responses to forest floor litter manipulation and nitrogen addition in a mixed-wood forest of northern china,"Changes in litterfall dynamics and soil properties due to anthropogenic or natural perturbations have important implications to soil carbon (C) and nutrient cycling via microbial pathway. Here we determine soil microbial responses to contrasting types of litter inputs (leaf vs. fine woody litter) and nitrogen (N) deposition by conducting a multi-year litter manipulation and N addition experiment in a mixed-wood forest. We found significantly higher soil organic C, total N, microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), microbial activity (MR), and activities of four soil extracellular enzymes, including beta-glucosidase (BG), N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), phenol oxidase (PO), and peroxidase (PER), as well as greater total bacteria biomass and relative abundance of gram-negative bacteria (G-) community, in top soils of plots with presence of leaf litter than of those without litter or with presence of only fine woody litter. No apparent additive or interactive effects of N addition were observed in this study. The occurrence of more labile leaf litter stimulated G-, which may facilitate microbial community growth and soil C stabilization as inferred by findings in literature. A continued treatment with contrasting types of litter inputs is likely to result in divergence in soil microbial community structure and function.",
310,included,A meta-analysis of the differences in environmental impacts between organic and conventional farming,"Purpose - This paper aims to perform a meta-analysis of the literature comparing the environmental impacts of The studied environmental impacts are related to land use efficiency, organic matter content in the soil, nitrate and phosphate leaching to the water system, greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity. Design/methodology/approach - The theoretic framework uses the driver-state-response framework and literature data were analysed using meta-analysis methodology. Meta-analysis is the statistical analysis of multiple study results. Data were obtained by screening peer reviewed literature. Findings - From the paper's meta-analysis it can conclude that soils in organic farming systems have on average a higher content of organic matter. It can also conclude that organic farming contributes positively to agro-biodiversity (breeds used by the farmers) and natural biodiversity (wild life). Concerning the impact of the organic farming system on nitrate and phosphorous leaching and greenhouse gas emissions the result of the analysis is not that straightforward. When expressed per production area organic farming scores better than conventional farming for these items. However, given the lower land use efficiency of organic farming in developed countries, this positive effect expressed per unit product is less pronounced or not present at all. Original value - Given the recent growth of organic farming and the general perception that organic farming is more environment friendly than its conventional counterpart, it is interesting to explore whether it meets the alleged benefits. By combining several studies in one analysis, the technique of meta-analysis is powerful and may allow the generation of more nuanced findings and the generalisation of those findings.",agricultural systems. eco-agriculture. ecological agriculture. environmental effects. organic culture. organic matter in soil.
311,excluded,The role of soil depth in the evaluation of management-induced effects on soil organic matter,"The aim of the current survey was to determine the relevance of the subsoil in the assessment of management effects on soil organic matter (SOM) in arable farming. Data in this survey were provided by the organic arable long-term field experiment Gladbacherhof (OAFEG). Three different farming types' were compared: mixed (MF), stockless with rotational ley (SFL) and stockless with cash crops (SFC). Each type had four different tillage treatments: full inversion (FIT), two-layer plough (TLP), reduced inversion (RIT) and non-inversion (NIT). The different mean masses of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) at 0-30-, 30-60-, 60-90- and 0-90-cm soil depths after three crop rotation cycles (17-year observation period) were evaluated and considered as an indicator of SOM. Farming types' differ in their effect on SOC and STN mass of the topsoil layer (0-30 cm) in the order MF > SFL > SFC (P < 0.01). For the 0-90-cm soil depth there were no differences between the treatments. Treatments with different tillage intensity did not show any effect on the contents of SOC or STN within the 0-30-cm soil depth. However, within the 30-60-cm depth full-inversion tillage (FIT) was associated with larger amounts of SOC and STN than the reduced tillage intensity treatments TLP, RIT and NIT (P < 0.01). This situation even resulted in significantly larger SOC and STN masses under FIT (P < 0.05) over the whole soil profile under study (0-90 cm). Our results suggest that sampling depth should be extended to include the effects on the upper subsoil in assessment of the effects of arable management on soil organic matter. Highlights Role of subsoil in the assessment of management effects on soil organic matter in arable farming is rarely accounted for. We investigated SOC and STN contents below 0-30-cm depth in a long-term field experiment. Consideration of the subsoil had a marked effect on the differentiation of the treatments. Sampling depth should be extended to include effects of management on the upper subsoil in the assessment of soil organic matter.",
312,excluded,A review of the mechanical effects of plant roots on concentrated flow erosion rates,"Living plant roots modify both mechanical and hydrological characteristics of the soil matrix (e.g. soil aggregate stability by root exudates, soil cohesion, infiltration rate, soil moisture content, soil organic matter) and negatively influence the soil erodibility. During the last two decades several studies reported on the effects of plant roots in controlling concentrated flow erosion rates. However a global analysis of the now available data on root effects is still lacking. Yet, a meta-data analysis will contribute to a better understanding of the soil-root interactions as our capability to assess the effectiveness of roots in reducing soil erosion rates due to concentrated flow in different environments remains difficult. The objectives of this study are therefore: i) to provide a state of the art on studies quantifying the effectiveness of roots in reducing soil erosion rates due to concentrated flow; and ii) to explore the overall trends in erosion reduction as a function of the root (length) density, root architecture and soil texture, based on an integrated analysis of published data. We therefore compiled a dataset of measured soil detachment ratios (SDR) for the root density (RD; 822 observations) as well as for the root length density (RLD; 274 observations). A Hill curve model best describes the decrease in SDR as a function of R(L)D. An important finding of our meta-analysis is that RLD is a much more suitable variable to estimate SDR compared to RD as it is linked to root architecture. However, a large proportion of the variability in SDR could not be attributed to RD or RLD, resulting in a low predictive accuracy of these Hill curve models with a model efficiency of 0.11 and 0.17 for RD and RLD respectively. Considering root architecture and soil texture did yield a better predictive model for RID with a model efficiency of 037 for fibrous roots in non-sandy soils while no improvement was found for RD. The unexplained variance is attributed to differences in experimental set-ups and measuring errors which could not be explicitly accounted for due to a lack of additional data. Based on those results, it remains difficult to predict the effects of roots on soil erosion rates. However, by using a Monte Carlo simulation approach, we were able to establish relationships that allow assessing the likely erosion-reducing effects of plant roots, while taking these uncertainties into account. Overall, this study demonstrates that plant roots can be very effective in reducing soil erosion rates due to concentrated flow. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

313,excluded,Changes in soil microbial biomass with manure application in cropping systems: A meta-analysis,"Soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) and nitrogen (SMBN) are important indices of soil bio-fertility. While intensively managed cropping systems can reduce microbial biomass, application of manure is a potential way to rebuilt microbial biomass and improve soil functions. However, the responses of SMBC and SMBN to manure application relative to mineral fertilizers (NPK) in Chinese cropping systems remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis based on 103 peer-reviewed publications with 1448 paired observations to identify the degree to which climate types, soil properties and agricultural managements regulate the responses of microbial biomass to manure amendment relative to NPK. The results indicated that manure application increased SMBC, SMBN, SMBC/soil organic carbon (SOC) and SMBN/soil total nitrogen (TN) by 40%, 55%, 16% and 21%, respectively, across all the observations compared to NPK. SMBC/SMBN under manure amendment (6.58 in average) was lower than that in NPK (7.86 in average). Manure-related factors, e.g. manure types, duration of application, manure-C and N input rates, were the strongest regulators of the response of microbial biomass. Soil properties and climates also contributed to considerable degrees of variation in microbial biomass response based on variance partitioning analysis (VPA). Results of the random forest (RF) models showed that manure type, application rate (manure-C and N input) as well as soil initial properties (SOC, TN and clay contents) were likely the predominant factors controlling the response of microbial biomass to manure application. Our study indicates that manure application can be an effective way to restore the loss of microbial biomass due to intensive application of NPK, yet variations in response are determined by specific manure type, application rate, as well as local conditions of climate and inherent soil properties.",Microbial biomass; Manure; Mineral fertilizer; Chinese cropland; Meta-analysis
314,excluded,Soil carbon balance in a clonal eucalyptus plantation in congo: effects of logging on carbon inputs and soil co2 efflux,"Soil CO2 efflux was measured in clear-cut and intact plots in order to quantify the impact of harvest on soil respiration in an intensively managed Eucalyptus plantation, and to evaluate the increase in heterotrophic component of soil respiration because of the decomposition of harvest residues. Soil CO2 effluxes showed a pronounced seasonal trend, which was well related to the pattern of precipitation and soil water content and were always significantly lower in the clear-cut plots than in the intact plots. On an annual basis, soil respiration represented 1.57 and 0.91 kg(C) m(-2) yr(-1) in intact and clear-cut plots, respectively. During the first year following harvest, residues have lost 0.79 kg(C) m(-2) yr(-1). Our estimate of heterotrophic respiration was calculated assuming that it was similar to soil respiration in the clear-cut area except that the decomposition of residues did not occur, and it was further corrected for differences in soil water content between intact and clear-cut plots and for the cessation of leaf and fine root turnover in clear cut. Heterotrophic respiration in clear-cut plots was estimated at 1.18 kg(C) m(-2) yr(-1) whereas it was only 0.65 kg(C) m(-2) yr(-1) in intact plots (41% of soil respiration). Assumptions and uncertainties with these calculations are discussed.",
315,excluded,Efficacy and safety of paricalcitol therapy for chronic kidney disease: a meta-analysis,"Background and objectives Observational data indicate that newer vitamin D compounds such as paricalcitol can suppress serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and reduce proteinuria in patients with CKD. To systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of paricalcitol for CKD, we conducted a meta-analysis of the published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Design, setting, participants, & measurements MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and article reference lists were searched for RCTs that compared paricalcitol with placebo in the treatment of patients with stage 2-5 CKD. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Jadad method. The results are summarized as risk ratios(RRs) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences for continuous outcomes. Results Nine studies (832 patients) were included. Compared with placebo, paricalcitol suppressed serum iPTH (RR, 6.37; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.64-8.74; P<0.001) and reduced proteinuria (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.25-2.25; P<0.001). Compared with the control group, the RR for hypercalcemia associated with paricalcitol use was 2.25 (95% CI, 0.81-6.26; P=0.12). Patients receiving paricalcitol therapy did not have an increased risk of endocrine system and cardiovascular system adverse effects (RR, 1.07; 95% Cl, 0.84-1.36; P=0.58). Conclusions We confirm that paricalcitol suppresses iPTH and lowers proteinuria in patients with stage 2-5 CKD without an increased risk of adverse events. A trend toward increased hypercalcemia did not reach statistical significance, but may be clinically relevant. A randomized trial is needed to determine if paricalcitol affects the development of ESRD or mortality. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 7: 391-400, 2012. doi: 10.2215/CJN.03000311",
316,excluded,Soil carbon loss regulated by drought intensity and available substrate: A meta-analysis,"Drought is one of the most important climate change factors, but its effects on ecosystems are little understood. While known to influence soil carbon (C) cycling, it remains unresolved if altered rainfall patterns induced by climate change will stimulate positive feedbacks of CO2 into the atmosphere. Using a meta-analysis frame-work including 1495 observations from 60 studies encompassing a variety of ecosystems and soil types, we investigated drought effects on respiration rates, cumulative respiration during drying-rewetting cycles, metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), dissolved organic C (DOC), microbial biomass and fungi to bacteria (F:B) ratios from laboratory and field experiments. We show that C-rich soils (>2% organic carbon) increase CO2 release into the atmosphere after intense droughts, but that C-poor soils show a net decline in C losses. We explain this self-reinforcing mechanism of climate change in C-rich soils by: (i) high substrate availability that magnify bursts of CO2 release after drought events and (ii) a shift in microbial community with increased loss of C per unit of biomass. These findings shed light on important responses of soil CO2 emissions to drought, which could either offset or facilitate positive feedbacks to global warming. Our results should be considered in global climate models, as even small changes in soil CO2 emission have large repercussions for global warming. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

317,included,Harvest impacts on soil carbon storage in temperate forests,"Forest soil carbon (C) storage is a significant component of the global C cycle, and is important for sustaining forest productivity. Although forest management may have substantial impacts on soil C storage, experimental data from forest harvesting studies have not been synthesized recently. To quantify the effects of harvesting on soil C, and to identify sources of variation in soil C responses to harvest, we used meta-analysis to test a database of 432 soil C response ratios drawn from temperate forest harvest studies around the world. Harvesting reduced soil C by an average of 8 +/- 3% (95% CI), although numerous sources of variation mediated this significant, overall effect. In particular, we found that C concentrations and C pool sizes responded differently to harvesting, and forest floors were more likely to lose C than mineral soils. Harvesting caused forest floor C storage to decline by a remarkably consistent 30 +/- 6%, but losses were significantly smaller in coniferous/mixed stands (-20%) than hardwoods (-36%). Mineral soils showed no significant, overall change in C storage due to harvest, and variation among mineral soils was best explained by soil taxonomy. Alfisols and Spodosols exhibited no significant changes, and Inceptisols and Ultisols lost mineral soil C (-13% and -7%, respectively). However, these C losses were neither permanent nor unavoidable. Controls on variation within orders were not consistent, but included species composition, time, and sampling depth. Temporal patterns and soil C budgets suggest that forest floor C losses probably have a lesser impact on total soil C storage on Alfisols, Inceptisols, and Ultisols than on Spodosols, which store proportionately large amounts of C in forest floors with long C recovery times (50-70 years). Mineral soil C losses on Inceptisols and Ultisols indicate that these orders are vulnerable to significant harvest-induced changes in total soil C storage, but alternative residue management and site preparation techniques, and the passage of time, may mitigate or negate these losses. Key findings of this analysis, including the dependence of forest floor and mineral soil C storage changes on species composition and soil taxonomic order, suggest that further primary research may make it possible to create predictive maps of forest harvesting effects on soil C storage.

Methods In a retrospective multicenter study between November 2015 and January 2017, SpyGlassDS (TM) procedures were analyzed in participating centers. Indications, accuracy of SOC-guided biopsies, management of large bile duct stones, and complications were analyzed. Follow-up was 4 months. Results Two hundred and six patients out of 250 examinations were evaluated. Indications were biliary stones (n = 132), bile duct stenosis (n = 93), stones and stenosis combined (n = 24), and bile duct leakage (n = 1). Of the 117 cases which were suspicious of malignancy, in 99 cases the lesion could be stratified into benign (n = 55) or malignant (n = 44) indicating a sensitivity of 95.5% and a specificity of 94.5% for the indication tumor. SOC-guided biopsies revealed a sensitivity of 57.7% with a specificity of 100%. In 107 examinations, biliary stones were visualized and could be completely removed in 91.1% with a need of three procedures (range 1-6) to achieve final stone clearance. In 75 cases, lithotripsy was performed and was successful in 71 cases (95%). Four out of 45 patients (8.9%) underwent cholecystectomy with surgical bile duct revision as a final therapy. Adverse Event (AE) occurred in 33/250 patients (13.2%) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) occurred in 1/250 patients (0.4%). Cholangitis was 1% (n = 102) after peri-interventional administration of antibiotics and 12.8% (n = 148) without antibiotic prophylaxis (p < 0.001). Conclusions SOC with SpyGlassDS (TM) became a new standard for the diagnosis of indefinite biliary lesions and therapy of large bile duct stones. The diagnostic yield of SOC-guided biopsies facilitated a definite diagnosis in most cases and should be improved by standardized biopsy protocols. SOC-guided interventions allowed removal of large biliary stones by SOC-guided lithotripsy. The complication rate of 13.2% can be considerably reduced by use of a single-shot antibiotic treatment.",Single-operator cholangiopancreatoscopy; SpyGlassDS (TM); Cholangioscopy
319,included,Ecosystem service provision of grain legume and cereal intercropping in Africa,"Achieving food security is challenging in Africa, a continent beset by low crop yield and soil quality, climate adversities, pests, weed infestations, and crop disease outbreaks. In this context, it is important to re-visit the resource-use efficiency and ecosystem service values of intercropping of grain legumes and cereals, a practice that has long been used by small-scale producers to mitigate the risk of crop failure and to safeguard household food availability. Despite its historical use, there are significant knowledge gaps regarding multiple aspects of intercropping, including examination of the different crop combinations on ecosystem services from agriculture. Using meta-analysis approach of land equivalent ratio (LER), a widely-accepted index to assess the efficiency of intercropping production systems, we found that intercropping of cereals with legumes resulted in an elevated LER (i.e., 1.31), regardless of species combination. A significantly greater LER than the overall LER (P < .05) was observed with the combination of maize-pigeon pea (LER = 1.57) and maize-groundnut (LER = 1.52). Increasing LER with intercropping was constant across rainfall variability, as well as in the absence of nitrogen fertilizer, which are the hallmark properties of intercropping in resource-deprived Africa. Intercropping could also reduce soil erosion, pest/weed incidence, and increase carbon sequestration by about ~46%, ~20–30%, and ~15%, respectively, compared to its sole crop control. In this comprehensive quantitative assessment of intercropping benefits across the African continent, we highlighted the provision of different ecosystem services from agroecosystems, a crucial foundation to achieving sustainable agricultural production.",zea-mays l.; cropping systems; guinea savanna; use efficiency; pearl-millet; soil-erosion; yield gaps; pigeon pea; maize; productivity
320,excluded,Do antiepileptic drugs increase the risk of infectious diseases? A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies,"AIMS Experimental studies show that some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may modify natural immune defences, thus influencing the risk of developing infectious diseases. The aim of this meta-analysis was to explore whether AEDs as a class of drugs or singularly may increase risk of infectious diseases. METHODS A meta-analysis of all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) investigating any AED in any condition was performed. All terms that could be coded in the System Organ Classes (SOCs) of infections and infestations using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities were recorded. Additional subanalyses were performed also pooling together AEDs sharing similar mechanisms of action. RESULTS Two hundreds and sixty-nine double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were identified and, among them, 127 RCTs with 16 AEDs (brivaracetam, gabapentin, lacosamide, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, perampanel, pregabalin, phenytoin, remacemide, retigabine, rufinamide, tiagabine, topiramate, valproate, zonisamide) reported at least one of 19 symptoms or diseases that could be included in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities SOC term infections and infestations. These terms were singularly recorded and then pooled together in the SOC term infection and infestation. Topiramate was significantly associated with an increased risk of infection (risk difference = 0.04; 95% confidence interval = 0.01/0.06), while oxcarbazepine was significantly associated with a lower risk (-0.005; -0.09/-0.01). Risk difference of all studies with all AEDs showed a slight, but significantly increased risk of infection (0.01; 0.00/0.002). Levetiracetam and brivaracetam RCTs, when pooled together, were associated with a significantly increased risk of infection (0.03; 0.01/0.05).

321,included,Experimental and observational studies find contrasting responses of soil nutrients to climate change,"Manipulative experiments and observations along environmental gradients, the two most common approaches to evaluate the impacts of climate change on nutrient cycling, are generally assumed to produce similar results, but this assumption has rarely been tested. We did so by conducting a meta-analysis and found that soil nutrients responded differentially to drivers of climate change depending on the approach considered. Soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations generally decreased with water addition in manipulative experiments but increased with annual precipitation along environmental gradients. Different patterns were also observed between warming experiments and temperature gradients. Our findings provide evidence of inconsistent results and suggest that manipulative experiments may be better predictors of the causal impacts of short-term (months to years) climate change on soil nutrients but environmental gradients may provide better information for long-term correlations (centuries to millennia) between these nutrients and climatic features.

322,excluded,Lower residue decomposition in historically charcoal-enriched soils is related to increased adsorption of organic matter,"Previous field observations have shown increased soil carbon (C) sequestration in charcoal amended soils due to an accumulation of non-charcoal derived soil C. This study was set up to compare and analyse mineralization of non-charcoal derived C between soils that were either or not historically enriched in charcoal. Maize straw (C-13-enriched) was added to samples of arable soil collected under historical charcoal kilns and corresponding adjacent control soil. The respiration was monitored in laboratory conditions for 227 days. Charcoal in soil significantly lowered total soil respiration (1905 vs. 1984 mg C kg(-1)). Mineralization of C-13-enriched added maize C (AMC) was unaffected by charcoal in the initial weeks after maize straw addition, however differences became significant at longer incubations yielding a markedly lower mineralized fraction in the charcoal enriched samples after 227 days (70 versus 62%, P < 0.05). A two fraction mineralization model revealed no charcoal effect on the labile fraction and its degradation but that the stable fraction of AMC was larger and degraded slower in the presence of charcoal. A soil drying-rewetting event (35 days) increased respiration to the same extent in charcoal-enriched as in adjacent soils. In contrast, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore water was significantly lower in charcoal-enriched than in adjacent soils. Microbial biomass-C (MBC) determined by fumigation-centrifugation was not significantly different between charcoal-enriched and adjacent soil (309 mg vs. 266 mg MBC kg(-1)). A soil adsorption experiment with DOC, extracted from a grassland soil, revealed larger DOC sorption with increasing soil charcoal concentration. This study shows that reduced C mineralization of non-charcoal C in charcoal-enriched soil is most likely related to enhanced sorption of more recalcitrant organic matter, rather than to lower MBC.

323,included,A meta-analysis of pesticide loss in runoff under conventional tillage and no-till management,"Global agricultural intensification has led to increased pesticide use (37-fold from 1960 to 2005) and soil erosion (14% since 2000). Conservation tillage, including no-till (NT), has been proposed as an alternative to conventional plow till (PT) to mitigate soil erosion, but past studies have reported mixed results on the effect of conservation tillage on pesticide loss. To explore the underlying factors of these differences, a meta-analysis was conducted using published data on pesticide concentration and load in agricultural runoff from NT and PT fields. Peer-reviewed articles (1985-2016) were compiled to build a database for analysis. Contrary to expectations, results showed greater concentration of atrazine, cyanazine, dicamba, and simazine in runoff from NT than PT fields. Further, we observed greater load of dicamba and metribuzin, but reduced load of alachlor from NT fields. Overall, the concentration and the load of pesticides were greater in runoff from NT fields, especially pesticides with high solubility and low affinity for solids. Thus, NT farming affects soil properties that control pesticide retention and interactions with soils, and ultimately their mobility in the environment. Future research is needed for a more complete understanding of pesticide-soil interactions in NT systems. This research could inform the selection of pesticides by farmers and improve the predictive power of pesticide transport models.",Tillage; Octanol-water partition coefficient; Solubility; pH; Soil organic matter; Texture
324,excluded,Integrative genomic analysis for the functional roles of itpkc in bone mineral density,"Osteoporosis is defined by low bone mineral density (BMD), which is mainly due to the imbalances in osteoclast and osteoblast activity. Previous studies indicated that early activation of osteoclasts relies on calcium entry through store-operated calcium (SOC) entry, and several genes, including STIM1, ORAI1, and ITPKC, are known as key regulators of SOC entry. However, the relationships between STIM1, ORAI1, ITPKC, and human BMD are still unclear. In order to investigate the plausible associations between these genes and BMD, we conducted a meta-analysis of genes expression and BMD using the publicly available GEO database. We further recruited 1044 subjects and tested associations between polymorphisms in these genes and BMD. Clinical information (including age, sex, and BMI) was collected and used for the analysis. Our results indicated that ITPKC gene expression was significantly associated with BMD. Furthermore, we found that one ITPKC SNP (rs2607420) was significantly associated with lumbar spine BMD. Through bioinformatics analysis, rs2607420 was found to be very likely to participate in the regulation of ITPKC expression. Our findings suggest that ITPKC is a susceptibility gene for BMD, and rs2607420 may play an important role in the regulation of this gene.",
325,excluded,Low infection rates and prolonged survival times of hemodialysis catheters in infants and children,"Background and objectives Hemodialysis (HD) catheter-related complications are regarded as the main cause of HD failure in infants and children with ESRD. In this study, we determined HD catheter infection rates and survival times in children. Design, setting, participants, & measurements We analyzed demographic, clinical, laboratory, and microbiologic data on all infants and children with ESRD who received HD therapy through a tunneled central venous catheter (CVC) in our Pediatric Dialysis Unit between January 2001 and December 2009. Our strict care of HD-CVCs makes no use of any kind of prophylactic antibiotic therapy. Results Twenty-nine children with ESRD (median age, 10 years) received HD through a CVC, for a total of 22,892 days during the study period. Eleven (38%) children were infants (< 1 year of age) who received HD for a cumulative 3779 days (16% of total). Fifty-nine CVCs were inserted, of which 13 (22%) were in infants. There were 12 episodes of CVC infection a rate of 0.52/1000 CVC days. Four (33%) episodes occurred in infants a rate of 1.06/1000 CVC days. Only three (5%) of the CVCs were removed because of infection. Median catheter survival time for all children was 310 days and for infants was 211 days. Conclusions Very low CVC infection rates (one infection per 5 CVC years) and prolonged CVC survival times (around 1 year) are achievable in infants and children with ESRD receiving HD therapy by adhering to a strict catheter management protocol and without using prophylactic antibiotic therapy.

326,included,Crop yield and soil organic matter after long-term straw return to soil in China,"Straw has been commonly incorporated to maintain soil fertility and crop productivity in China, but effects of long-term straw incorporation on crop yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) have not been thoroughly evaluated. Thus, this study analyzed data collected in long-term (> 10-year) trials across the major agricultural zones of China. Across the trials, relative to straw removal, straw return significantly increased crop yield, SOC and TN (by 7.0, 10.1 and 11.0 %, respectively). In some trials with winter wheat in northern China, straw return reduced yield by 0.6-7.1 %. The effects of straw return on SOC and TN were not significantly affected by experimental duration, land use type and cropping system, but positively and linearly related to the inputs of straw-C and -N, respectively. Interestingly, SOC and TN responses to straw return were decoupled in upland and upland-paddy soils in China, but not in paddy soils. Mean values of straw-C sequestration efficiency (7.7, 10.3 and 9.4 %, under corn, wheat and rice, respectively) indicate that 100 % straw return could increase SOC by 281.7 Tg C in 18 years (the mean experimental period of the considered studies) in China. Our analyses demonstrate that straw return is an effective practice for sustaining crop productivity and soil fertility in large parts of China, but site-specific factors should be considered.",Straw return; Soil organic carbon; Total nitrogen; Crop yield; Carbon; sequestration; Long-term experiment

The aim of this article is to extend this new perspective again by developing a holistic framework model, the Systemic Salutogenic Interaction Model (SSIM): Firstly, within the SSIM health-promoting interactions are the primary unit of analysis whose dynamic is influenced both by leaders and employees. By focusing on health-promoting interaction dynamics the up to now neglected aspect that employees can also influence their leaders' health is taken into account. Secondly, for first time the SSIM explicitly focuses on sense of coherence in the workplace (Work-SoC) as part of a specific, scientifically based health mechanism of health-supportive leadership. Thirdly, the model postulates a significant impact of contextual factors on health-promoting interactions between leaders and employees. By this addition of neglected aspects the SSIM provides new impetus for health-supportive leadership research and the practice of occupational health management.",Leadership; Health; Sense of coherence; Interaction processes; Salutogenesis

This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the influence of long-term application of different fertilizers and straw retention on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, to compare the calculated response ratios with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-recommended default relative stock change factors, and to propose recommendations for enhancing SOC sequestration. The meta-analysis indicated that the long-term application of chemical fertilizers (CF), organic fertilizers (OF), combined chemical and organic fertilizers (CFOF), and straw return (SR) significantly enhanced the SOC storage. Response ratios varied significantly (pA"" ""<A"" ""0.05) across different fertilization measures and climatic zones, and was sensitive to the initial SOC content. The mean response ratio was 0.94 for no fertilizer (NF), 1.08 for CF, 1.48 for OF, 1.38 for CFOF, and 1.28 for SR. When IPCC default values for response ratios were applied, SOC storage with OF and CFOF treatments in warm temperate regions with a dry climate was underestimated by 26%, and in the cool temperate region with a moist climate was overestimated by 25% (pA"" ""<A"" ""0.05). Analysis showed that sustained application of organic fertilizers and straw return could be a beneficial measures to mitigate climate change and ensure food security in China.

329,included,Multiple trade-offs regulate the effects of woody plant removal on biodiversity and ecosystem functions in global rangelands,"Woody plant encroachment is a major land management issue. Woody removal often aims to restore the original grassy ecosystem, but few studies have assessed the role of woody removal on ecosystem functions and biodiversity at global scales. We collected data from 140 global studies and evaluated how different woody plant removal methods affected biodiversity (plant and animal diversity) and ecosystem functions (plant production, hydrological function, soil carbon) across global rangelands. Our results indicate that the impact of removal is strongly context dependent, varying with the specific response variable, removal method, and traits of the target species. Over all treatments, woody plant removal increased grass biomass and total groundstorey diversity. Physical and chemical removal methods increased grass biomass and total groundstorey biomass (i.e., non-woody plants, including grass biomass), but burning reduced animal diversity. The impact of different treatment methods declined with time since removal, particularly for total groundstorey biomass. Removing pyramid-shaped woody plants increased total groundstorey biomass and hydrological function but reduced total groundstorey diversity. Environmental context (e.g., aridity and soil texture) indirectly controlled the effect of removal on biomass and biodiversity by influencing plant traits such as plant shape, allelopathic, or roots types. Our study demonstrates that a one-size-fits-all approach to woody plant removal is not appropriate, and that consideration of woody plant identity, removal method, and environmental context is critical for optimizing removal outcomes. Applying this knowledge is fundamental for maintaining diverse and functional rangeland ecosystems as we move toward a drier and more variable climate.",encroachment; global synthesis; meta-analysis; rangeland management; removal method; shrub removal; thickening; woody plant traits
330,excluded,Effects of land-use change on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems,"Most changes in land use affect the amount of carbon held in vegetation and soil, thereby, either releasing carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) to, or removing it from, the atmosphere. The greatest fluxes of carbon result from conversion of forests to open lands (and vice versa). Model-based estimates of the flux of carbon attributable to land-use change are highly variable, however, largely as a result of uncertainties in the areas annually affected by different types of land-use change. Uncertain rates of tropical deforestation, for example, account for more than half of the range in estimates of the global carbon flux. Three other factors account for much of the rest of the uncertainty: (1) the initial stocks of carbon in ecosystems affected by land-use change (i.e., spatial heterogeneity), (2) per hectare changes in carbon stocks in response to different types of land-use change, and (3) legacy effects; that is, the time it takes for carbon stocks to equilibrate following a change in land use. For the tropics, recent satellite-based estimates of deforestation are lower than previous estimates and yield calculated carbon emissions from land-use change that are similar to independently-derived estimates of the total net flux for the region. The similarity suggests that changes in land use account for the net flux of carbon from the tropics. For the northern mid-latitudes, the carbon sink attributed to land-use change is less than the sink obtained by other methods, suggesting either an incomplete accounting of land-use change or the importance of other factors in explaining the current carbon sink in that region.",
331,included,Responses of soil carbon sequestration to climate-smart agriculture practices: A meta-analysis,"Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) management practices (e.g., conservation tillage, cover crops, and biochar applications) have been widely adopted to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring crop productivity. However, current measurements regarding the influences of CSA management practices on SOC sequestration diverge widely, making it difficult to derive conclusions about individual and combined CSA management effects and bringing large uncertainties in quantifying the potential of the agricultural sector to mitigate climate change. We conducted a meta-analysis of 3,049 paired measurements from 417 peer-reviewed articles to examine the effects of three common CSA management practices on SOC sequestration as well as the environmental controlling factors. We found that, on average, biochar applications represented the most effective approach for increasing SOC content (39%), followed by cover crops (6%) and conservation tillage (5%). Further analysis suggested that the effects of CSA management practices were more pronounced in areas with relatively warmer climates or lower nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that, through adopting CSA practices, cropland could be an improved carbon sink. We also highlight the importance of considering local environmental factors (e.g., climate and soil conditions and their combination with other management practices) in identifying appropriate CSA practices for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring crop productivity.",biochar; climate; conservation tillage; cover crop; meta-analysis; soil organic carbon
332,included,Management-Induced Changes to Soil Organic Carbon in China: A Meta-analysis,"Soil carbon (C) sequestration is an environmentally friendly and efficient strategy to offset emissions of greenhouse gases and mitigate climate change. However, inappropriate farming practices can deplete soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and degrade soil quality. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess and identify the effects of improved farming practices on SOC sequestration in China by compiling a data set of 83 studies. The results indicated that SOC concentration and stocks at 0–30cm depth significantly increased by 1.00±0.26gkg−1 and 0.97±0.24Mgha−1 when plow tillage with residue removal was converted to no-till with residue retention (NT); 1.11±0.21gkg−1 and 2.09±0.46Mgha−1 when no fertilization was changed to chemical fertilization (CF); and 1.99±0.62gkg−1 and 3.09±0.99Mgha−1 when CF was changed to manure application (MF) (P<0.05), respectively. However, increases in SOC were primarily observed in the surface layer and decreased with soil depth. Therefore, the adoption of NT and MF in conjunction with CF is an effective strategy to enhance SOC stock in the surface layer. Further, in single-crop farming regions, the effects are more significant at 0–10cm depth; and the new equilibrium can occur within 11–20years after the adoption of NT. In double-crop farming regions, conversion to MF enhanced the SOC at 0–20cm depth over 16years. Additional research is warranted to credibly assess the rates of residue and manure input, soil “C saturation,” and soil type on the potential SOC sink capacity in China's croplands.",croplands

This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus SoC platinum-based chemotherapy from the French healthcare system perspective. Methods: A three-state partitioned-survival model was adapted to project outcomes and costs of squamous and non-squamous NSCLC patients respectively, over a 10-year time horizon. Clinical and utility data were collected from the trial. A network meta-analysis was performed to consider platinum-based triplets also used for non-squamous NSCLC. Direct medical costs were considered based on ressources identified from the trial and literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 4% per year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as cost per Life Year (LY) and cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to assess the robustness of results. Results: For squamous NSCLC, pembrolizumab was projected to increase life expectancy of patients by 0.93 LY (11 months), and 0.74 QALY (9 months) for an incremental cost of (sic)62,032 compared with platinum-based doublets. The ICER of pembrolizumab versus platinum-based doublets was (sic)66,825/LY and (sic)84,097/QALY. For non-squamous NSCLC, pembrolizumab was projected to increase life expectancy of patients by 0.85-1.32 LYs (10.2-15.8 months) and 0.64-1.02 QALYs (7.7-12.2 months) for an incremental cost varying from (sic)-14,947-+47,064 depending on the specific comparator. The ICER of pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab was (sic)62,846/LY and (sic)78,729/QALY; regimens including pemetrexed were dominated. Results were most sensitive to extrapolations of survival outcomes and assumptions for continued effectiveness and treatment duration of pembrolizumab. Conclusions: Pembrolizumab appears cost-effective versus SoC chemotherapy for first-line treatment of PD-L1 positive (50%) metastatic NSCLC patients in France, assuming willingness-to-pay under 100,000 /QALY (OECD threshold in the discussion section).",Advanced NSCLC; PD-L1 positive; Cost effectiveness; Pembrolizumab; Economics

A cross-sectional study was conducted on older adults (>= 60 years old) residing in Soc Son district, northern Vietnam. Non-frailty, pre-frailty, and frailty conditions were evaluated using Fried's frailty criteria. The EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels(EQ-5D-5L) instrument was employed to measure HRQOL. Socioeconomic, behavioral, health status, and healthcare utilization characteristics were collected as covariates. Among 523 older adults, 65.6% were pre-frail, and 21.7% were frail. The mean EQ-5D-5L indexes of the non-frailty, pre-frailty, and frailty groups were 0.70 (SD = 0.18), 0.70 (SD = 0.19), and 0.58 (SD = 0.20), respectively. The differences were found between non-frailty and frailty groups (p < 0.01), as well as the pre-frailty and frailty groups (p<0.01). After adjusting for covariates, the estimated mean difference in the HRQOL between the non-frailty and frailty groups was -0.10 (95%CI= -0.17; -0.02) (R-2 = 45.2%), showing a 10% reduction of the maximum EQ-5D-5L index.This study emphasized the high prevalence of frailty among older adults in the rural communities of Vietnam.

335,included,Effects of elevated CO2 and N fertilization on plant and soil carbon pools of managed grasslands: a meta-analysis,"Elevated atmospheric CO2 levels and increasing nitrogen deposition both stimulate plant production in terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, nitrogen deposition could alleviate an increasing nitrogen limitation experienced by plants exposed to elevated CO2 concentrations. However, an increased rate of C flux through the soil compartment as a consequence of elevated CO2 concentrations has been suggested to limit C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems, questioning the potential for terrestrial C uptake to mitigate increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Our study used data from 77 published studies applying elevated CO2 and/or N fertilization treatment to monitor carbon storage potential in grasslands, and considered the influence of management practices involving biomass removal or irrigation on the elevated CO2 effects. Our results confirmed a positive effect of elevated CO2 levels and nitrogen fertilization on plant growth, but revealed that N availability is essential for the increased C influx under elevated CO2 to propagate into below-ground C pools. However, moderate nutrient additions also promoted decomposition processes in elevated CO2, reducing the potential for increased soil C storage. An important role was attributed to the CO2 response of root biomass in soil carbon responses to elevated CO2, since there was a lower potential for increases in soil C content when root biomass increased. Future elevated CO2 concentrations and increasing N deposition might thus increase C storage in plant biomass, but the potential for increased soil C storage is limited.",carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; grassland; growth rate; management practice; nutrient uptake; phytomass; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; terrestrial ecosystem
336,excluded,Long-term effects of three multicomponent exercise interventions on physical performance and fall-related psychological outcomes in community-dwelling older adults: a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term effects of three strength and balance exercise interventions on physical performance, fall-related psychological outcomes, and falls in older people. DESIGN: A single-blinded, four-group, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Community, Germany. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults aged 70 to 90 who had fallen in the past 6 months or reported fear of falling. INTERVENTION: After baseline assessment, 280 participants were randomly assigned to the control group (CG; no intervention; n = 80) or one of three strength and balance exercise interventions (the strength and balance group (SBG; strength and balance only; n = 63), the fitness group (FG; strength and balance plus endurance training; n = 64), or the multifaceted group (MG; strength and balance plus fall risk education; n = 73). The interventions consisted of 32 one-hour group sessions in 16 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Data on physical performance, fallrelated psychological outcomes, and falls were collected for 24 months. RESULTS: Mixed-effects regression analyses showed improved short- and long-term (12 and 24 months, respectively) physical performance for the SBG and FG, particularly regarding mobility, balance, and walking speed (P < .05). The improvements in physical performance outcomes were most prominent in the FG. Fallrelated psychological outcomes, number of falls, and injurious falls were not significantly different from in the control group. CONCLUSION: Training focusing on strength, balance, and endurance can enhance physical performance for up to 24 months in community-dwelling older adults. These findings did not translate to improved fall-related psychological outcomes or reduced incidence of falls. This demonstrates the need for a different approach (e.g., regarding intervention dose and components) to gain intervention benefits in the multiple domains that contribute to independence and well-being in older adults.

337,excluded,Sorption to biochar impacts -glucosidase and phosphatase enzyme activities,"Extracellular enzymes catalyze biogeochemical reactions in soil, cycling carbon and nutrients in agricultural systems. Enzymes respond quickly to soil management, including organic amendment inputs, such as biochar, a charcoal-like solid byproduct of bioenergy production. In a previous agricultural field trial, a pine biochar amendment caused an approximately 40% decrease in the enzyme activities of -glucosidase (BG) and phosphatase (PHOS). The large surface area of the pine biochar has the potential to sorb nutrients and other organic molecules. To test if sorption caused decreased enzyme activity, we used a laboratory assay to quantify the activity of two sorbed enzymes: BG and acid PHOS, involved in the cycling of carbon and phosphorous. The enzymes were incubated with three solid phases: (1) the high surface area pine biochar, (2) the agricultural soil, and (3) a low surface area grass biochar, for an additional comparison. We quantified the sorbed enzymes at pH 6, 7, and 8, using a Bradford protein assay, and measured the immobilized enzyme activities via high-throughput fluorometric analysis. After sorption onto pine biochar, detectable BG and PHOS activity levels dropped by over 95% relative to the soil, supporting direct sorption as one mechanism that reduces enzyme activity in biochar amended soil. This laboratory assay demonstrated that sorption could account for the lack of priming of native soil organic matter and changes in soil phosphorous cycling after pine biochar addition.",biochar; surface area; enzyme activity; immobilization; protein assay

From an organization development (OD) perspective, this article presents a conceptual model to explain reactions to MSF in feedback recipients. In the ideal mode, MSF recipients react to MSF data with open-mindedness, a strong willingness to evaluate self-perceptions by learning from others' perspectives. In the converse mode of defensiveness, MSF recipients are likely to be closed to and dismissive of others' perspectives. The usefulness of the model for testing alternative MSF approaches is illustrated through a discussion of two MSF techniques: the Self-Other Comparison (SOC) approach and the Predicted-Other Comparison (POC) approach. Approaches that foster a mode of open-mindedness over defensiveness are more likely to produce the intended learning benefits.",
339,excluded,Nitrogen addition alters mineralization dynamics of 13c-depleted leaf and twig litter and reduces leaching of older doc from mineral soil,"Recent reviews indicate that N deposition increases soil organic matter (SOM) storage in forests but the undelying processes are poorly understood. Our aim was to quantify the impacts of increased N inputs on soil C fluxes such as C mineralization and leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from different litter materials and native SOM. We added 5.5 similar to g similar to N similar to m-2 similar to yr-1 as NH4NO3 over 1 similar to year to two beech forest stands on calcareous soils in the Swiss Jura. We replaced the native litter layer with 13C-depleted twigs and leaves (d13C: -38.4 and -40.8 parts per thousand) in late fall and measured N effects on litter- and SOM-derived C fluxes. Nitrogen addition did not significantly affect annual C losses through mineralization, but altered the temporal dynamics in litter mineralization: increased N inputs stimulated initial mineralization during winter (leaves: +25%; twigs: +22%), but suppressed rates in the subsequent summer. The switch from a positive to a negative response occurred earlier and more strongly for leaves than for twigs (-21% vs. 0%). Nitrogen addition did not influence microbial respiration from the nonlabeled calcareous mineral soil below the litter which contrasts with recent meta-analysis primarily based on acidic soils. Leaching of DOC from the litter layer was not affected by NH4NO3 additions, but DOC fluxes from the mineral soils at 5 and 10 similar to cm depth were significantly reduced by 17%. The 13C tracking indicated that litter-derived C contributed less than 15% of the DOC flux from the mineral soil, with N additions not affecting this fraction. Hence, the suppressed DOC fluxes from the mineral soil at higher N inputs can be attributed to reduced mobilization of nonlitter derived older DOC. We relate this decline to an altered solute chemistry by NH4NO3 additions, an increased ionic strength and acidification resulting from nitrification, rather than to a change in microbial decomposition.",
340,included,"Biochar effects on crop yields with and without fertilizer: A meta‐analysis of field studies using separate controls. Soil Use and Management, 36(1), pp.2-18.","The added value of biochar when applied along with fertilizers, beyond that of the fertilizers themselves, has not been summarized. Focusing on direct comparisons between biochar additions (≤20 t ha−1) – separately considering the addition or not of inorganic fertilizers (IF) and/or organic amendments (OA) along with biochar – and two different controls (with and without the addition of IF and/or OA), we carried out a meta‐analysis to explain short‐term (1‐year) field responses in crop yield across different climates, soils, biochars and management practices worldwide. Compared with the non‐fertilized control, a 26% (CI: 15%–40%) increase in yield was observed with the use of IF only, whereas that of biochar along with IF caused a 48% (CI: 30%–70%) increase. Compared with the use of IF only, the addition of biochar along with IF caused a 15% (CI: 11%–19%) increase in yield, indicating that biochar was as effective as fertilizers in increasing crop yields when added in combination. The use of biochar alone did not increase crop yield regardless of the control considered. Whereas in the short term, liming may have partly contributed to the beneficial effect of biochar (>90% was plant‐derived) when added along with IF, a separate meta‐analysis – using those studies that reported crop yields for different years after a single biochar application – showed a 31% (CI: 17%–49%) increase in crop yield over time (≥ 3 years), which denotes the influence of biochar properties other than liming (i.e. an increase in CEC). Our results also suggest that biochar application rates > 10 t ha−1 do not contribute to greater crop yield (at least in the short term). Data limitations precluded identification of the influence of feedstock, production conditions or climatic conditions without bias. As the response of crop yield to biochar addition was less a result of climatic zones or soil type than fertilizer use (chiefly N additions), the choice of nutrient addition along with biochar should be priorities for future research and development regardless of the region.",
341,excluded,Mulch amendment facilitates early revegetation development on an abandoned field in northern mixed grass prairies of north america,"Extensive areas of the northern mixed grass prairies of North America require restoration and reclamation as they have been extensively disturbed by agricultural, mining and oil and gas related activities. Amending seedbeds with mulch may avoid soil erosion and help both plant recruitment and early vegetation development in these water limited landscapes. A field experiment was established to determine if straw and hay mulch facilitate early revegetation. The site is an abandoned irrigation area in southern Alberta, Canada. Soil was tilled and the seedbed prepared through manual harrowing, then plots were broadcast seeded with Elymus trachycaulus, Bouteloua gracilis, Astragalus canadensis and Linum lewisii. Hay and straw mulch were applied at two rates (300 and 600 g m(-2)). Plant recruitment and cover were assessed through the first four years. Mulch had a positive impact on recruitment of all species planted except Bouteloua gracilis. While a thinner material like hay proved to be most effective at high rates (600 g m(-2)), a thicker material like straw encouraged quick recruitment for these species only at low application rates (300 g m(-2)). However, these early differences among mulch treatments did not show an impact in either recruitment or cover during subsequent years. Bouteloua gracilis, whose recruitment and growth were broadly impaired by mulch, showed an abundant and constantly increasing cover in the bare ground control and in plots with low application rates of hay.

Soc. Psychol. 45, 137-141. (doi:10.1027/1864-9335/a000192)). First, individual-experiment Bayesian parameter estimation revealed that for directed effect size measures, only three out of 44 central 95% credible intervals did not overlap with zero and fell in the expected direction. For undirected effect size measures, only four out of 59 credible intervals contained values greater than 0.10 (10% of variance explained) and only 19 intervals contained values larger than 0.05. Second, a Bayesian randomeffects meta-analysis for all 38 t-tests showed that only one out of the 38 hierarchically estimated credible intervals did not overlap with zero and fell in the expected direction. Third, a Bayes factor hypothesis test was used to quantify the evidence for the null hypothesis against a default one-sided alternative. Only seven out of 60 Bayes factors indicated non-anecdotal support in favour of the alternative hypothesis (BF10 > 3), whereas 51 Bayes factors indicated at least some support for the null hypothesis. We hope that future analyses of replication success will embrace a more inclusive statistical approach by adopting a wider range of complementary techniques.",preregistration; evidence; reproducibility; credible interval; Bayes factor
343,excluded,Effect of dialysis modality on survival of hepatitis c-infected esrf patients,"Background and objectives Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in end-stage renal failure (ESRF) patients. Despite a lower incidence and risk of transmission of HCV infection with peritoneal dialysis (PD), the optimal dialysis modality for HCV-infected ESRF patients is not known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of dialysis modality on the survival of HCV-infected ESRF patients. Design, setting, participants, & measurements The study included all adult incident ESRF patients in Australia and New Zealand who commenced dialysis between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 2008, and were HCV antibody-positive at the time of dialysis commencement. Time to all-cause mortality was compared between hemodialysis (HD) and PD according to modality assignment at day 90, using Cox proportional hazards model analysis. Results A total of 424 HCV-infected ESRF patients commenced dialysis during the study period and survived for at least 90 days (PD n = 134; HD n = 290). Mortality rates were comparable between PD and HD in the first year (10.7 versus 13.8 deaths per 100 patient-years, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.26) and thereafter (20 versus 15.9 deaths per 100 patient-years, respectively; HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.88). Conclusions The survival of HCV-infected ESRF patients is comparable between PD and HD. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 6: 2657-2661, 2011. doi: 10.2215/CJN.02200311",
344,excluded,Feedbacks between nitrogen fixation and soil organic matter increase ecosystem functions in diversified agroecosystems,"Nitrogen (N) losses from intensified agriculture are a major cause of global change, due to nitrate (NO3-) export and the eutrophication of aquatic systems as well as emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere. Diversified agroecosystems with legume cover crops couple N and carbon (C) inputs to soil and reduce N pollution, but there is a need to identify controls on legume N-2 fixation across ecosystems with variable soil conditions. Here, I tested the hypothesis that N mineralization from turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) regulates legume N-2 fixation across 10 farms that spanned a gradient of SOM levels. I separated soil samples into two SOM fractions, based on size and density, which are indicators of soil nutrient cycling and N availability (free particulate organic matter and intra-aggregate particulate organic matter [POM]). This study indicates downregulation of legume N-2 fixation in diversified agroecosystems with increasing N availability in intra-aggregate POM and increasing N mineralization. Intercropping the legume with a grass weakened the relationship between N in POM and N-2 fixation due to N assimilation by the grass. Further, mean rates of N and C mineralization across sites increased with two seasons of a legume-grass cover crop mixture, which could enhance this stabilizing feedback between soil N availability and N-2 fixation over time. These results suggest a potential mechanism for the diversity-ecosystem-function relationships measured in long-term studies of agroecosystems, in which regular use of legume cover crops increases total soil organic C and N and reduces negative environmental impacts of crop production.",agroecosystem; biological nitrogen fixation; cover crop; legume; mineralization; particulate organic matter; soil carbon; soil organic matter
345,excluded,Nitrogen addition aggravates microbial carbon limitation: Evidence from ecoenzymatic stoichiometry,"Nitrogen (N) deposition may change carbon (C) or nutrient limitation of soil microbes, but whether such change can be reflected by ecoenzymatic stoichiometry has not been well studied. Here, we synthesized data from 36 published studies to evaluate the responses of ecoenzymatic stoichiometry to N addition. Results showed that N addition did not change the enzyme ratio (1:1:1) of C, N, and phosphorus (P) acquisition, and also did not change vector angle of ecoenzymatic stoichiometry which is an indicator of microbial P limitation. However, N addition increased two indicators of C-limitation significantly (i.e., activity of (beta-(D) -glucosidase and vector length), both of which indicated that N addition aggravated microbial C-limitation. The aggravated C-limitation may be partly due to the reduced decomposition of recalcitrant organic C. Our study extends our understanding of the effects of N deposition on C cycling from a new perspective.",N deposition; Ecoenzymatic stoichiometry; C limitation; Nutrient limitation
346,excluded,Measurements and models to identify agroecosystem practices that enhance soil organic carbon under changing climate,"Adapting to the anticipated impacts of climate change is a pressing issue facing agriculture, as precipitation and temperature changes are expected to have major effects on agricultural production in many regions of the world. These changes will also affect soil organic matter decomposition and associated stocks of soil organic C (SOC), which have the potential to feed back to climate change and affect agroecosystem resiliency. This special section brings together multiple efforts to assess effects of climate change on SOC stocks around the globe in grassland, pasture, and crop agroecosystems under varying management practices. The overall goal of these efforts is to identify optimum practices to enhance SOC accumulation. In this article, we summarize the highlights of these papers and assess their broader implications for future research to enhance agroecosystem SOC accumulation and resiliency to climate change. Fourteen of the twenty contributions apply dynamic process-based models to assess climate and/or long-term management impacts on SOC stocks, and four papers use statistical SOC models across landscapes or regions. Also included are one meta-analysis and one long-term study. The models applied in this collection performed well when reliable input data were available, underlining the usefulness of modeling efforts to inform management decisions that enhance SOC stocks. Overall, the findings confirm that most agroecosystems have the potential to store SOC through improved management. However, this will be challenging, particularly for dryland agriculture, unless crop yield and crop biomass increase under projected climate change.",
347,included,Management opportunities to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from Chinese agriculture,"Agriculture accounts for approximately 11% of China's national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Through adoption of region-specific best management practices, Chinese farmers can contribute to emission reduction while maintaining food security for its large population (>1300 Million). This paper presents the outcome of a bottom-up assessment to quantify technical potential of mitigation measures for Chinese agriculture using meta-analysis of data from 240 publications for cropland, 67 publications for grassland and 139 publications for livestock, and provides the reference scenario for the cost analysis of identified mitigation measures. Management options with greatest mitigation potential for rice, or rice-based cropping systems are conservation tillage, controlled irrigation; replacement of urea with ammonium sulphate, nitrogen (N) inhibitor application, reduced N fertilizer application, integrated rice-fish-duck farming and biochar application. A 15% reduction in current average synthetic N fertilizer application for rice in China i.e., 231 kg N ha(-1), would result in 12% decrease in direct soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Combined application of chemical and organic fertilizer, conservation tillage, biochar application and reduced N application are possible measures that can reduce overall GHG emissions from upland cropping systems. Conventional fertilizer inputs for greenhouse vegetables are more than 2-8 times the optimal crop nutrient demand. A 20-40% reduction in N fertilizer application to vegetable crops can reduce N2O emissions by 32-121%, while not negatively impacting the yield. One of the most important mitigation measures for agricultural grasslands could be conversion of low yielding cropland, particularly on slopes, to shrub land or grassland, which is also a promising option to decrease soil erosion. In addition, grazing exclusion and reduced grazing intensity can increase SOC sequestration and decrease overall emissions while improving the largely degraded grasslands. For livestock production, where poor quality forage is commonly fed, improving grazing management and diet quality can reduce methane (CH4) emissions by 11% and 5%, on average. Dietary supplements can reduce CH4 emissions further, with lipids (15% reduction) and tannins or saponins (11% reduction) showing the greatest potential. We also suggest the most economically cost-effective mitigation measures, drawing on related work on the construction of marginal abatement cost curves for the sector. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study also examined concomitant medicines use which may have potentiated the risk of the reported adverse events. Research, design and methods: Three databases were searched for spontaneous AERs associated with celecoxib, submitted within the past 10 years: Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration Database of Adverse Event Notifications; Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online Database; and the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System Database. Analysis of the AERs focussed on the identification of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and renal adverse events and concomitant medications suspected of potentiating adverse event risks. Results: A total of 24,232 celecoxib AERs were identified. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported adverse events at the system organ class (SOC) level in the AERs. A large number of AERs documented the use of potentially inappropriate concomitant medicines which may have increased the risk of the reported adverse events. Conclusions: The large number of reports that involved a concomitant medicine that was in contravention with prescribing guidelines indicates an increased need for efforts to support the safe prescribing of celecoxib.",Celecoxib; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; adverse event; inappropriate prescribing; pharmacoepidemiology
349,included,How does tillage intensity affect soil organic carbon? A systematic review,"Background: The loss of carbon (C) from agricultural soils has been, in part, attributed to tillage, a common practice providing a number of benefits to farmers. The promotion of less intensive tillage practices and no tillage (NT) (the absence of mechanical soil disturbance) aims to mitigate negative impacts on soil quality and to preserve soil organic carbon (SOC). Several reviews and meta-analyses have shown both beneficial and null effects on SOC due to no tillage relative to conventional tillage, hence there is a need for a comprehensive systematic review to answer the question: what is the impact of reduced tillage intensity on SOC? Methods: We systematically reviewed relevant research in boreo-temperate regions using, as a basis, evidence identified within a recently completed systematic map on the impacts of farming on SOC. We performed an update of the original searches to include studies published since the map search. We screened all evidence for relevance according to predetermined inclusion criteria. Studies were appraised and subject to data extraction. Meta-analyses were performed to investigate the impact of reducing tillage [from high (HT) to intermediate intensity (IT), HT to NT, and from IT to NT] for SOC concentration and SOC stock in the upper soil and at lower depths. Results: A total of 351 studies were included in the systematic review: 18% from an update of research published in the 2 years since the systematic map. SOC concentration was significantly higher in NT relative to both IT [1.18 g/kg +/- 0.34 (SE)] and HT [2.09 g/kg +/- 0.34 (SE)] in the upper soil layer (0-15 cm). IT was also found to be significant higher [1.30 g/kg +/- 0.22 (SE)] in SOC concentration than HT for the upper soil layer (0-15 cm). At lower depths, only IT SOC compared with HT at 15-30 cm showed a significant difference; being 0.89 g/kg [+/- 0.20 (SE)] lower in intermediate intensity tillage. For stock data NT had significantly higher SOC stocks down to 30 cm than either HT [4.61 Mg/ha +/- 1.95 (SE)] or IT [3.85 Mg/ha +/- 1.64 (SE)]. No other comparisons were significant. Conclusions: The transition of tilled croplands to NT and conservation tillage has been credited with substantial potential to mitigate climate change via C storage. Based on our results, C stock increase under NT compared to HT was in the upper soil (0-30 cm) around 4.6 Mg/ha (0.78-8.43 Mg/ha, 95% CI) over >= 10 years, while no effect was detected in the full soil profile. The results support those from several previous studies and reviews that NT and IT increase SOC in the topsoil. Higher SOC stocks or concentrations in the upper soil not only promote a more productive soil with higher biological activity but also provide resilience to extreme weather conditions. The effect of tillage practices on total SOC stocks will be further evaluated in a forthcoming project accounting for soil bulk densities and crop yields. Our findings can hopefully be used to guide policies for sustainable management of agricultural soils.",Agriculture; Conservation; Till; Plough; Farming; Land management; Climate change; Land use change; Carbon sequestration
350,included,Grazing intensity significantly changes the C : N : P stoichiometry in grassland ecosystems,"Aim Livestock grazing can alter carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles, thereby affecting the C : N : P stoichiometry in grasslands. In this study, we aimed to examine mechanisms underlying the impacts of grazing on grassland C : N : P stoichiometry, focusing on belowground processes and their linkages with aboveground vegetation properties. Location Global. Time period 1900-2018. Major taxa studied Grassland ecosystems. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis based on 129 published studies to synthesize the effects of grazing on the C : N : P stoichiometry of leaves, stems, litter, roots, microbial biomass, and soil in grassland ecosystems. Results Grazing significantly affected the C, N and P pools, and then the C : N : P stoichiometry in grassland ecosystems. Grazing effects on C : N : P stoichiometry varied strongly with grazing intensity. Specifically, heavy grazing decreased all C : N : P stoichiometry except litter N : P and root C : N ratios, while light and moderate grazing caused less negative or positive effects. Grazing effects on litter C : N ratio were negatively correlated with grazing effects on soil C : N ratios under light and moderate grazing, but this relationship was positive under heavy grazing. In contrast, grazing effects on root C : P and soil C : P were positively correlated under light and moderate grazing but negatively correlated under heavy grazing. Importantly, grazing significantly decreased the soil N pool by 10.0% but increased the soil P pool by 3.6%, indicating differential mechanisms for grazing impact on N and P cycles in grasslands. Main conclusions Our results strongly suggest that grazing intensity regulates the biogeochemical cycles of C, N and P in grassland ecosystems by affecting plant nutrient use efficiency and soil physicochemical processes. Therefore, incorporating grazing intensity into Earth system models may improve predictions of climate-grassland feedbacks in the Anthropocene.",carbon sequestration; ecosystem functioning; grasslands; grazing intensity; meta-analysis; stoichiometry
351,excluded,Adverse effects of pharmacologic treatments of major depression in older adults,"OBJECTIVES To assess adverse effects of pharmacologic antidepressants for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults 65 years of age or older. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING Specialist or generalist outpatient setting, rehabilitation facility, and nursing facilities. PARTICIPANTS Persons 65 years and older with MDD. INTERVENTION Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), bupropion, mirtazapine, trazodone, vilazodone, or vortioxetine compared with another antidepressant, placebo, or nonpharmacologic therapy. MEASUREMENTS Adverse events, arrhythmias, cognitive impairment, falls, fractures, hospitalization, mortality, QTc prolongation, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events. RESULTS Nineteen randomized controlled trials and two observational studies were included. Most studies evaluated treatment of the acute phase (<12 wk) of MDD of moderate severity. SSRIs led to a statistically similar frequency of overall adverse events vs placebo (moderate strength of evidence [SOE]), but SNRIs caused more overall adverse events vs placebo (high SOE) during the acute treatment phase. Both SSRIs and SNRIs led to more study withdrawals due to adverse events vs placebo (SSRIs low SOE; SNRIs moderate SOE). Duloxetine led to a more falls vs placebo (moderate SOE) during 24 weeks of acute and continuation treatment of MDD. CONCLUSION In patients 65 years of age or older with MDD, treatment of the acute phase of MDD with SNRIs, but not SSRIs, was associated with a statistically greater number of overall adverse events vs placebo. SSRIs and SNRIs led to a greater number of study withdrawals due to adverse events vs placebo. Duloxetine increased the risk of falls that as an outcome was underreported in the literature. Few studies examined head-to-head comparisons, most trials were not powered to evaluate adverse events, and results of observational studies may be confounded. Comparative long-term studies reporting specific adverse events are needed to inform clinical decision making regarding choice of antidepressants in this population.

352,excluded,A systematic review and meta-analysis of pregnancy outcomes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis,"Background and objectives: Studies of the impact of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its pregnancy complications have yielded conflicting results. Major limitations of these studies relate to their small numbers of patients and retrospective designs. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic literature review of pregnancy outcomes in women with SLE and a meta-analysis of the association of lupus nephritis with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: We searched electronic databases from 1980 to 2009 and reviewed papers with validity criteria. Random-effects analytical methods were used to evaluate pregnancy complications rates. Results: Thirty-seven studies with 1842 patients and 2751 pregnancies were included. Maternal complications included lupus flare (25.6%), hypertension (16.3%), nephritis (16.1%), pre-eclampsia (7.6%), and eclampsia (0.8%). The induced abortion rate was 5.9%, and when excluded, fetal complications included spontaneous abortion (16.0%), stillbirth (3.6%), neonatal deaths (2.5%), and intrauterine growth retardation (12.7%). The unsuccessful pregnancy rate was 23.4%, and the premature birth rate was 39.4%. Meta-regression analysis showed statistically significant positive associations between premature birth rate and active nephritis and increased hypertension rates in subjects with active nephritis or a history of nephritis. History of nephritis was also associated with pre-eclampsia. Anti-phospholipid antibodies were associated with hypertension, premature birth, and an increased rate of induced abortion. Conclusions: In patients with SLE, both lupus nephritis and anti-phospholipid antibodies increase the risks for maternal hypertension and premature births. The presented evidence further supports timing of pregnancy relative to SLE activity and multispecialty care of these patients. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 5: 2060-2068, 2010. doi: 10.2215/CJN.00240110",
353,included,A meta-analysis of fertilizer-induced soil NO and combined NO+N2O emissions,"Abstract Soils are among the important sources of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O), acting as a critical role in atmospheric chemistry. Updated data derived from 114 peer-reviewed publications with 520 field measurements were synthesized using meta-analysis procedure to examine the N fertilizer-induced soil NO and the combined NO+N2O emissions across global soils. Besides factors identified in earlier reviews, additional factors responsible for NO fluxes were fertilizer type, soil C/N ratio, crop residue incorporation, tillage, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, drought and biomass burning. When averaged across all measurements, soil NO-N fluxes were estimated to be 4.06 kg ha−1 yr−1, with the greatest (9.75 kg ha−1 yr−1) in vegetable croplands and the lowest (0.11 kg ha−1 yr−1) in rice paddies. Soil NO emissions were more enhanced by synthetic N fertilizer (+38%), relative to organic (+20%) or mixed N (+18%) sources. Compared with synthetic N fertilizer alone, synthetic N fertilizer combined with nitrification inhibitors substantially reduced soil NO emissions by 81%. The global mean direct emission factors of N fertilizer for NO (EFNO) and combined NO+N2O (EFc) were estimated to be 1.16% and 2.58%, with 95% confidence intervals of 0.71–1.61% and 1.81–3.35%, respectively. Forests had the greatest EFNO (2.39%). Within the croplands, the EFNO (1.71%) and EFc (4.13%) were the greatest in vegetable cropping fields. Among different chemical N fertilizer varieties, ammonium nitrate had the greatest EFNO (2.93%) and EFc (5.97%). Some options such as organic instead of synthetic N fertilizer, decreasing N fertilizer input rate, nitrification inhibitor and low irrigation frequency could be adopted to mitigate soil NO emissions. More field measurements over multiyears are highly needed to minimize the estimate uncertainties and mitigate soil NO emissions, particularly in forests and vegetable croplands.",emission factor; fertilizer; meta-analysis; nitric oxide; nitrous oxide; trace gas
354,included,Land use change to bioenergy: A meta-analysis of soil carbon and GHG emissions,"A systematic review and meta-analysis were used to assess the current state of knowledge and quantify the effects of land use change (LUC) to second generation (2G), non-food bioenergy crops on soil organic carbon (SOC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of relevance to temperate zone agriculture. Following analysis from 138 original studies, transitions from arable to short rotation coppice (SRC, poplar or willow) or perennial grasses (mostly Miscanthus or switchgrass) resulted in increased SOC (+5.0 +/- 7.8% and +25.7 +/- 6.7% respectively). Transitions from grassland to SRC were broadly neutral (+3.7 +/- 14.6%), whilst grassland to perennial grass transitions and forest to SRC both showed a decrease in SOC (-10.9 +/- 4.3% and -11.4 +/- 23.4% respectively). There were insufficient paired data to conduct a strict meta-analysis for GHG emissions but summary figures of general trends in GHGs from 188 original studies revealed increased and decreased soil CO2 emissions following transition from forests and arable to perennial grasses. We demonstrate that significant knowledge gaps exist surrounding the effects of land use change to bioenergy on greenhouse gas balance, particularly for CH4. There is also large uncertainty in quantifying transitions from grasslands and transitions to short rotation forestry. A striking finding of this review is the lack of empirical studies that are available to validate modelled data. Given that models are extensively use in the development of bioenergy LCA and sustainability criteria, this is an area where further longterm data sets are required. (C) 2015 The Authors.

355,excluded,Will heterotrophic soil respiration be more sensitive to warming than autotrophic respiration in subtropical forests?,"Understanding the responses of heterotrophic (R-h) and autotrophic (R-a) components of soil respiration (R-s) to warming is important in evaluating and modelling the effects of changes in climate on soil carbon (C) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. We used a mesocosm system with buried heating cables (5 degrees C warming) to investigate the responses of R-s, R-h and R-a to warming in a subtropical forest in southern China. Soil CO2 effluxes were measured with a portable automatic soil CO2 flux system from March 2014 to July 2015. We found that warming increased mean R-s and R-h from 788 to 1036 g C m(-2) year(-1) (+31%) and from 512 to 707 g C m(-2) year(-1) (+38%), respectively. There was no difference in R-a between the warming treatment and the control. The lack of response of R-a to warming was probably because the fine root biomass did not change with warming treatment. Soil warming also increased available dissolved organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, actinomycetal biomass and arbuscular mycorrhizal biomass. Our results suggest that R-h might be more sensitive to climate warming than R-a, and future climate warming could increase soil C loss from increased R-h in subtropical forest ecosystems. Highlights A field warming experiment with partitioning of soil respiration in a humid subtropical forest. Warming increased R-s and R-h without significantly altering soil microbial substrate availability. Heterotrophic respiration appeared more sensitive to warming than autotrophic respiration.

Pollution of soil with heavy metals has occurred in many parts of the world, but their effects on soil OC and N have not been well addressed. Relevant data were extracted from peer-reviewed journal papers and analysed by a meta-analysis to determine how long-term heavy metal pollution affected soil OC and N status. Plant biomass decreased significantly because heavy metals in soil decreased soil OC and N concentrations by 5.0 and 17.9%, respectively, but increased the C/N ratio by 5.1%. The largest reductions in soil OC and N concentrations were in soil more strongly polluted by metals. The changes in soil OC and N with metal pollution varied with climatic conditions. More substantial decreases in OC and N concentrations were likely to occur in polluted soil with large background contents of OC and low pH. Overall, heavy metals were linked to greater reductions in soil OC and N concentrations in natural ecosystems than in agro-ecosystems. These results provided a quantitative evaluation of the effects of heavy metal pollution on the decrease in soil C and N concentrations and, therefore, on global climate change. Further consideration should be given to changes in the cycling of C and N in soil polluted with metals in natural and agro-ecosystems.",agricultural ecosystem; climate change; climate conditions; concentration (composition); food security; global climate; heavy metal; meta-analysis; nutrient cycling; organic carbon; phytomass; pollution control; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil pollution

The association between HCV and GN has been supported by previous research but little is known about the relationship between HCV and kidney disease. Design, setting, participants, & measurements A systematic review of the published medical literature was conducted to determine if HCV is associated with increased likelihood of kidney disease in the general population. A random-effects model was used to generate a summary estimate of the relative risk for kidney disease, defined as an estimated GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) or proteinuria, with HCV across the published studies. Results Nine clinical studies (817,917 unique individuals) were identified. Pooling of study results demonstrated the absence of a relationship between HCV seropositive status and reduced estimated GFR (adjusted relative risk, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.91, 1.38; P=0.28) according to the random-effects model. HCV seropositive serology was an independent and significant risk factor for proteinuria (defined by urine dipstick test or spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio) in the general population, with a summary estimate for adjusted relative risk of 1.47 (95% confidence interval, 1.12, 1.94; P=0.006). Significant heterogeneity was observed between studies (Ri=0.82; P value by Q test, <0.001). Conclusions This meta-analysis shows that HCV is independently associated with proteinuria but not with reduced GFR in the general population. Substantial heterogeneity occurred.

358,excluded,Cereal yield response to conservation agriculture practices in drylands of West Africa: A quantitative synthesis,"To address the decline in crop productivity in the drylands of West Africa, many initiatives have focused on combating soil degradation. Various practices including (1) parkland trees associated with crops, (2) coppicing trees, (3) green manure, (4) mulching. (5) crop rotation and intercropping, and (6) traditional soil/water conservation have been tested. The present study attempts to provide a comprehensive, quantitative synthesis of existing reports on the effect of conservation agriculture (CA) practices on crop yield response in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Senegal. Out of a total of 155 reports found, 63 fulfilled all the appropriate criteria to be included in the meta-analysis of the effect of various conservation agriculture practices on the yield response of maize, millet and sorghum. The study revealed significant variability in cereal yield response (and hence risk) with all the practices examined. Despite the variability, the mean effects of the six CA practices on crop yield were more positive than negative except with parkland trees. However, for this last practice, species like Faidherbia albida exerts more positive impact on crop yield. Yield increases relative to the control were higher with green manure and mulching than with coppicing trees and parklands. Increases in yield in the six CA practices were higher on low to medium productivity sites for maize, millet and sorghum. Coppicing trees and rotations improved yields when the rainfall is >800 mm whereas the opposite happens with parkland and soil-water conservation measures. Mulching performed better when the rainfall is <600 mm. The variability (and hence yield risks) calls for more understanding of the processes and application of appropriate tree management to reduce crop yield losses while still providing products (fruits, leaves, wood, etc.) and services (soil carbon building up) for long-term sustainability of the production systems in drylands of West Africa.

359,included,Synthesis of soil carbon losses in response to conversion of grassland to agriculture land,"The conversion of grassland to cropland is one of the major changes in land use, and it accelerates both soil erosion and the loss of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the general patterns of SOC loss after grassland cultivation are rarely assessed, and the potential mechanisms remain unclear. Here, a meta-analysis of 81 case studies was performed to show that SOC decreased with soil depths of 0-60 cm after grassland conversion, but no significant differences were found at depths > 60 cm. SOC also declined significantly with the duration of grassland conversion. The response ratio of SOC changes tended to reach equilibrium after 20 years of grassland cropping. Our results indicate that reduction in SOC mainly depended on changes in precipitation, soil physical-chemical properties and soil microbes. These conclusions highlight the importance of improving the accuracy of predictions on SOC losses and on the global carbon cycle in the face of land-use changes worldwide.",SOC loss; Meta-analysis; Grassland cultivation; Soil properties; Land-use change
360,excluded,Nitrous oxide emissions in chinese vegetable systems: a meta-analysis,"China accounts for more than half of the world's vegetable production, and identifying the contribution of vegetable production to nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in China is therefore important. We performed a meta-analysis that included 153 field measurements of N2O emissions from 21 field studies in China. Our goal was to quantify N2O emissions and fertilizer nitrogen (N) based-emission factors (EFs) in Chinese vegetable systems and to clarify the effects of rates and types of N fertilizer in both open-field and greenhouse systems. The results indicated that the intensive vegetable systems in China had an average N2O emission of 3.91 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and an EF of 0.69%. Although the EF was lower than the IPCC default value of 1.0%, the average N2O emission was generally greater than in other cropping systems due to greater input of N fertilizers. The EFs were similar in greenhouse vs. open-field systems but N2O emissions were about 1.4 times greater in greenhouses. The EFs were not affected by N rate, but N2O emissions for both open-field and greenhouse systems increased with N rate. The total and fertilizer-induced N2O emissions, as well as EFs, were unaffected by the type of fertilizers in greenhouse system under same N rates. In addition to providing basic information about N2O emissions from Chinese vegetable systems, the results suggest that N2O emissions could be reduced without reducing yields by treating vegetable systems in China with a combination of synthetic N fertilizer and manure at optimized economic rates.

361,excluded,Challenges in synthesizing and interpreting the evidence from a systematic review of multifactorial interventions to prevent functional decline in older adults,"A systematic review of multifactorial assessment and management interventions to prevent functional decline in older adults was undertaken for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. It was not possible to determine net benefit because of heterogeneity of studies, including how older adults were selected and their risk of functional decline; the broad spectrum and multifactorial nature of interventions evaluated; the suboptimal and inconsistent use of outcomes measured; and the inconsistent and inadequate reporting of data that might allow comparison of populations, interventions, and outcomes between studies. This review process illustrated the complexities encountered when synthesizing and interpreting the evidence in geriatric research and methods of reviewing complex interventions and multiple interrelated health outcomes. This article summarizes the review findings, focusing on methodological challenges, and offers suggestions to researchers on the design, reporting, and analysis of trials that would help address these challenges and allow for better interpretation of evidence in the future.

362,excluded,A network meta-analysis in comparing prophylactic treatments of radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis for patients with head and neck cancers receiving radiotherapy,"Objectives: The objective of this network meta-analysis is to optimize the prophylactic treatment for radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer (HNSCC) receiving postoperative or definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Materials and methods: We searched electronic databases to identify all eligible randomized clinical trials on oral mucositis. The endpoint was grade 0-2 oral mucositis. Odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted. Network meta-analysis was performed using the frequentist approach to conduct multiple treatment comparisons. Results: In total, 57 trials with 5261 patients were eligible for this study. Both direct and network meta-analysis revealed that low-level laser additional to standard oral care (SOC) was better than most of the other treatments and achieved the highest effect on grade 0-2 oral mucositis, with a surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) of 95.8%; however, SOC with or without placebo had worse effect than most of the other treatments and was ranked worst (SUCRA = 0.4%). Moreover, sensitivity analysis performed after we had combined the SOC and placebo groups (non-medication treatment, NMT) yielded similar results, with SUCRA of 91.3% and 3.5% for low-level laser and NMT, respectively. Conclusions: Low-level laser additional to SOC may be a more effective prophylactic treatment for reducing severe radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis; SOC alone is insufficient for patients with HNSCC receiving postoperative or definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.",Head and neck cancers; Radiotherapy; Supportive care; Oral mucositis; Network meta-analysis

A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors against PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA4 have emerged as new treatments for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), despite discrepancy between their effects on OS and PFS. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing immunotherapy to standard of care (SOC) in mRCC. Methods: Searching the MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library and ASCO Meeting abstracts prospective studies were identified. Data extraction was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. The measured outcomes were OS, PFS, and ORB. Results: A total of 2832 patients were available for evaluation of OS, and 3033 for PFS and ORR. Compared to SOC, immunotherapy improved OS (HR = 0.75; 95%CI 0.66-0.85; p < 0.001), and PFS (HR = 0.88; 95%CI 0.80-0.97; p = 0.009). The PFS benefit was not confirmed when considering patients treated in first-line only (p = 0.10). Conversely, significant ORR improvement was found in patients treated in first-line only (HR = 1.14; 95%CI 1.02-1.28; p = 0.03) but not in the overall population. Conclusions: Immunotherapy improved OS compared to SOC in mRCC, irrespective of treatment line. In first line, immunotherapy also increased the ORR compared to sunitinib. A lack of correlation between OS and PFS was confirmed, the latter to be used cautiously for the design and interpretation of trials involving immunotherapy in mRCC.",Anti-PD-1/PD-L1; Immunotherapy; Immune checkpoint inhibitors; mRCC; Targeted therapies
364,excluded,"Land-use history, forest conversion, and soil organic carbon in pine plantations and native forests of south eastern australia","Land-use history - the number, type, and duration of previous land uses - is relevant to many questions regarding land-use effects on soil carbon, but is infrequently reported. We examine the importance of land-use history variables, as well as topographic and edaphic variables, on soil C in a range of forest types - native forest, pine plantations, secondary forest and rehabilitated forest - at three contrasting locations in south eastern Australia. Our comparisons include a novel forest conversion of exotic pine plantations to native, broadleaf forest. Using nested ANOVAs, we detected few differences in soil C concentration indices (total C, microbial biomass C, K2SO4-C) and C content among eucalypt-dominated vegetation and pine plantations within each location (0-10 cm depth). However, planned contrasts indicated a 30% decrease in soil C content with conversion of native forest to pine plantation of age 37 years. The reverse land-use change - pine plantation to native, broadleaf forest - was associated with a decrease in soil C concentration and content at one location (40%; age 12-13 years) and no detectable changes at another (to age 7 years). Variable effect between locations of this novel land-use change on soil C could be due to differences in potential productivity, conifer species, and plantation age. We used correlation coefficients and general linear models to identify widely applicable variables for predicting soil C concentration and content at local scales (<= 20 km(2)). Within-location relationships with topographic variables were weak and infrequent relative to those with edaphic and land-use history variables. Soil texture was strongly correlated with soil C at each location, although the relative significance of different particle size fractions differed among locations. Electrical conductivity appeared more widely applicable since it was included in C models at two locations. Combining land-use history and edaphic variables produced strong predictive models for soil C concentrations and content at two locations (total r(2) 0.83 to 0.95). Positive relationships were indicated between soil C and 'age of current vegetation' at one location, and negative relationships were indicated with 'number of land uses' at another. These data highlight a potential predictive role for land-use history variables in local-scale assessments of soil C in forested landscapes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
365,excluded,Soil mulching significantly enhances yields and water and nitrogen use efficiencies of maize and wheat: a meta-analysis,"Global crop yields are limited by water and nutrient availability. Soil mulching (with plastic or straw) reduces evaporation, modifies soil temperature and thereby affects crop yields. Reported effects of mulching are sometimes contradictory, likely due to differences in climatic conditions, soil characteristics, crop species, and also water and nitrogen (N) input levels. Here we report on a meta-analysis of the effects of mulching on wheat and maize, using 1310 yield observations from 74 studies conducted in 19 countries. Our results indicate that mulching significantly increased yields, WUE (yield per unit water) and NUE (yield per unit N) by up to 60%, compared with no-mulching. Effects were larger for maize than wheat, and larger for plastic mulching than straw mulching. Interestingly, plastic mulching performed better at relatively low temperature while straw mulching showed the opposite trend. Effects of mulching also tended to decrease with increasing water input. Mulching effects were not related to soil organic matter content. In conclusion, soil mulching can significantly increase maize and wheat yields, WUE and NUE, and thereby may contribute to closing the yield gap between attainable and actual yields, especially in dryland and low nutrient input agriculture. The management of soil mulching requires site-specific knowledge.",
366,included,Overgrazing decreases soil organic carbon stocks the most under dry climates and low soil pH: A meta-analysis shows,"Grasslands occupy about 40% of the world's land surface and store approximately 10% of the global soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. This SOC pool, in which a larger proportion is held in the topsoil (0-0.3 in), is strongly influenced by grassland management. Despite this, it is not yet fully understood how grassland SOC stocks respond to degradation, particularly for the different environmental conditions found globally. The objective of this review was to elucidate the impact of grassland degradation on changes in SOC stocks and the main environmental controls, worldwide, as a prerequisite for rehabilitation. A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted using 55 studies with 628 soil profiles under temperate, humid, sub-humid, tropical and semi-arid conditions, to compare SOC stocks in the topsoil of non degraded and degraded grassland soils. Grassland degradation significantly reduced SOC stocks by 16% in dry climates (<600 mm) compared to 8% in wet climates (>1000 mm) and Asia was the most affected continent (-23.7%). Moreover, the depletion of SOC stock induced by degradation was more pronounced in sandy (<20% clay) soils with a high SOC depletion of 10% compared to 1% in clayey (>= 32% clay) soils. Furthermore, grassland degradation significantly reduced SOC by 14% in acidic soils (pH <= 5), while SOC changes were negligible for higher pH. Assuming that 30% of grasslands worldwide are degraded, the amount of SOC likely to be lost would be 4.05 Gt C, with a 95% confidence between 1.8 and 6.3 Gt C (i.e. from 1.2 to 4.2% of the whole grassland soil stock). These results by pointing to greater SOC losses from grasslands under dry climates and sandy acidic soils allow identification of grassland soils for which SOC stocks are the most vulnerable, while also informing on rehabilitation measures.

368,included,The effects of plantation practice on soil properties based on the comparison between natural and planted forests: a meta-analysis,"Aim The effects of planted forests on soils are of great concern in the context of the increasing demands for timber production and atmospheric CO2 sequestration. However, the effects of plantations on soil properties have not well been quantified. We determined the effects of plantation practice on soil properties based on a comparison between natural forests and plantations. Locations All the continents except for Antarctica. Methods The meta-analysis approach was used to examine the differences in 14 soil variables in the mineral layer, including pH, bulk density, C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na and Al concentrations, C/N ratio, cation exchangeable capacity, base saturation, and moisture between plantations and their adjacent natural forests from 73 published studies. Results Plantations did not differ from natural forests in soil pH or soil Na and Al concentrations. Soil bulk density below plantations increased by 12.5%, and soil C and N concentrations decreased by 36.0% and 26.5%, respectively, relative to natural forests. The other eight variables were 8.4-30.6% lower in plantations than in natural forests. The general patterns also held true for planted trees from the genus Pinus and for study regions in China. The patterns for soil bulk density and C and N concentrations were not different between the two groups in relation to various factors: stand age (< 25 years versus >= 25 years), leaf form (broadleaved versus coniferous) and leaf seasonality (deciduous versus evergreen), tree species origin (native versus exotic), land-use history (afforestation versus reforestation) and site preparation for plantations (burnt versus un-burnt treatment), and biogeographic zone (tropical versus temperate). Main conclusions Our results suggest that the level of soil fertility in plantations is unlikely to restore to the level in natural forests, implying that the replacement of natural forests by plantations may be a practice best avoided to maintain the ecosystem sustainability.",Biogeographic factor; carbon sequestration; natural forests; plantation; forests; soil fertility; soil properties; stand types
369,excluded,Potential carbon sequestration of european arable soils estimated by modelling a comprehensive set of management practices,"Bottom-up estimates from long-term field experiments and modelling are the most commonly used approaches to estimate the carbon (C) sequestration potential of the agricultural sector. However, when data are required at European level, important margins of uncertainty still exist due to the representativeness of local data at large scale or different assumptions and information utilized for running models. In this context, a pan-European (EU + Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Norway) simulation platform with high spatial resolution and harmonized data sets was developed to provide consistent scenarios in support of possible carbon sequestration policies. Using the CENTURY agroecosystem model, six alternative management practices (AMP) scenarios were assessed as alternatives to the business as usual situation (BAU). These consisted of the conversion of arable land to grassland (and vice versa), straw incorporation, reduced tillage, straw incorporation combined with reduced tillage, ley cropping system and cover crops. The conversion into grassland showed the highest soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates, ranging between 0.4 and 0.8 t Cha(-1)yr(-1), while the opposite extreme scenario (100% of grassland conversion into arable) gave cumulated losses of up to 2 Gt of C by 2100. Among the other practices, ley cropping systems and cover crops gave better performances than straw incorporation and reduced tillage. The allocation of 12 to 28% of the European arable land to different AMP combinations resulted in a potential SOC sequestration of 101-336 Mt CO2 eq. by 2020 and 549-2141 Mt CO2 eq. by 2100. Modelled carbon sequestration rates compared with values from an ad hoc meta-analysis confirmed the robustness of these estimates.",

Methods: An individual patient state transition microsimulation model was developed to project health outcomes and costs over 10 years, using a payer perspective. The incremental benefit estimates for golimumab were driven by induction response and risk of a flare. Flare risks post-induction were derived for golimumab from the PURSUIT maintenance trial and extension study, while those for SoC were derived from the placebo arms of the Active Ulcerative Colitis Trials (ACT) 1 and 2. Other inputs were derived from multiple sources, including retrospective claims analyses and literature. Costs are reported in 2014 Canadian dollars. A 5% annual discount rate was applied to costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: Compared with SoC, golimumab was projected to increase the time spent in mild disease or remission states, decrease flare rates, and increase QALYs. These gains were achieved with higher direct medical costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for golimumab vs SoC was $63,487 per QALY. Limitations: The long-term flare projections for SoC were based on the data available from the ACT 1 and 2 placebo arms, as data were not available from the PURSUIT maintenance or extension trial. Additionally, the study was limited to only SoC and golimumab, due to the availability of individual patient data to analyze. Conclusion: This economic analysis concluded that treatment with golimumab is likely more cost-effective vs SoC when considering cost-effectiveness acceptability thresholds from $50,000-$ 100,000 per QALY.",Health economics; ulcerative colitis; golimumab; cost-effectiveness; state transition model

372,excluded,Transient elastography to assess hepatic fibrosis in hemodialysis chronic hepatitis c patients,"Background and objectives Although percutaneous liver biopsy (PLB) is the gold standard for staging hepatic fibrosis in hemodialysis patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) before renal transplantation or antiviral therapy, concerns exist about serious postbiopsy complications. Using transient elastography (TE, Fibroscan (R)) to predict the severity of hepatic fibrosis has not been prospectively evaluated in these patients. Design, setting, participants, & measurements A total of 284 hemodialysis patients with CHC were enrolled. TE and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) were performed before PLB. The severity of hepatic fibrosis was staged by METAVIR scores ranging from F0 to F4. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of TE and APRI, taking PLB as the reference standard. Results The areas under curves of TE were higher than those of APRI in predicting patients with significant hepatic fibrosis (>= F2) (0.96 versus 0.84, P < 0.001), those with advanced hepatic fibrosis (>= F3) (0.98 versus 0.93, P = 0.04), and those with cirrhosis (F4) (0.99 versus 0.92, P = 0.13). Choosing optimized liver stiffness measurements of 5.3, 8.3, and 9.2 kPa had high sensitivity (93-100%) and specificity (88-99%), and 87, 97, and 93% of the patients with a fibrosis stage of >= F2, >= F3 and F4 were correctly diagnosed without PLB, respectively. Conclusions TE is superior to APRI in assessing the severity of hepatic fibrosis and can substantially decrease the need of staging PLB in hemodialysis patients with CHC.

373,excluded,A literature review to evaluate the economic value of ranolazine for the symptomatic treatment of chronic angina pectoris,"To conduct a systematic review of the evidence regarding the economic value of ranolazine relative to standard-of-care (SOC) for the treatment of symptomatic chronic stable angina (CSA). Electronic databases were searched using relevant keywords. The identified studies were independently reviewed by two investigators against pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Their data were extracted using a relevant form and consequently were synthesized. Studies were also evaluated using the Quality of Health Economic Studies scale. The main outcomes considered were the cost and effectiveness for each comparator and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted-life year (QALY) gained. Six studies were included in the review. Five of these assessed the cost-utility of ranolazine added to SOC, compared to SOC alone, using decision trees or Markov models whereas one was a retrospective cost evaluation study. The analysis was conducted from a payer perspective in five studies and from a societal perspective in one study with the time horizon varying between six months and a year. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), ranged from (sic)4000 to (sic)15,000 per QALY gained. Ranolazine appears to be dominant or cost-effective, mainly due to its ability to decrease angina-related hospitalizations and also due to a marginal improvement in quality of life. The acquisition cost of ranolazine was the variable with the greatest impact upon the ICER. The existing evidence, although limited, indicates that ranolazine may be a dominant or cost-effective therapy option, for the treatment of patients with symptomatic CSA. Further research is required to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ranolazine. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

374,included,Cropland abandonment enhances soil inorganic nitrogen retention and carbon stock in China: A meta-analysis,"Transforming cropland into a semi-natural ecosystem is an effective approach to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen sequestration. However, we know little about large-scale response patterns of SOC, soil inorganic nitrogen (SIN), and their interactions over long time of ecosystem restoration. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine changes in SOC, SIN, and their relationship along 50 year's ecosystem development from cropland transformation in China's 'Grain for Green' Programme. Our results showed that SOC and SIN were consistently enhanced by 57% and 35% with transformation, respectively. Similar with SOC, SIN had higher response magnitudes when cropland was restored to forests (47%) than to shrublands (36%) and grasslands (24%). Both SOC and SIN response ratios showed a quadratic relationship with precipitation. Moreover, we found a strong linear relationship (R-2 = 0.36) between SOC and SIN response ratio, with the slope indicating a 0.43% increase in SIN per 1% of increasing SOC. This SIN retention capacity (the slope) significantly increased with restoration time but reduced with precipitation, temperature, and initial SOC. Restored forest had a lower SIN retention capacity than had shrubland and grassland. Overall, this study represents the first to regionally uncover SIN retention mechanism with increasing SOC during ecosystem development. It suggests that ecosystem restoration will contribute more to relieving serious environmental problems (i.e., N leaching and N2O emission) by enhancing SIN retention in China's Grain for Green Programme.","cropland, grassland, forest, shrubland"
375,included,Effects of fertilizer management practices on yield-scaled ammonia emissions from croplands in China: A meta-analysis,"China is the world's largest emitter of gaseous ammonia (NH3), a compound carrying severe human health and ecosystem risks. Fertilizer N application is a major source of this atmospheric NH3. Although many studies have measured NH3 emissions from croplands in China, the effect of fertilizer management on yield-scaled NH3 emissions (i.e., NH3 intensity defined as NH3 emissions per unit crop yield) is not so clear. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to quantify the effect of fertilizer management on NH3 emissions and NH3 intensity in China's croplands. Results showed that the increases in NH3 emissions and NH3 intensity over a control were greater at high N rates (averaging 305 kg N ha(-1)) than at low and moderate N rates (average of 130 and 206 kg N ha(-1), respectively), while crop yields stayed flat over this range. Rice had greater increases in NH3 emissions and NH3 intensity in response to inorganic N addition than other crops. The emission factor for NH3 was also higher for rice than other crops, and increased with increasing proportions of basal N and soil organic carbon and total N content. Relative to surface application, deep placement of fertilizer N significantly decreased NH3 emissions and NH3 intensity. Increasing the number of split applications of fertilizer N significantly reduced NH3 emissions and NH3 intensity. Organic manure amendments substituting for all or part of inorganic fertilizer N significantly mitigated NH3 emissions and led to a reduction in NH3 intensity but without statistical significance. The use of slow release fertilizers (SR) and urease inhibitors (UI) significantly reduced NH3 emissions and NH3 intensity, whereas application of nitrification inhibitors actually increased both. Overall, this meta analysis demonstrates that appropriate fertilizer management practices such as reducing inorganic N rates, deep placement and split applications of fertilizer N, and using SR and UI can all reduce NH3 emissions and NH3 intensity in China's croplands.

376,excluded,Sustainable intensification through rotations with grain legumes in sub-saharan africa: a review,"We conducted a systematic review of literature on the residual effects of grain legumes in cereal -based systems of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to quantify the magnitude and variability of rotational effects, to explore the importance of environmental and management factors in determining variability and to evaluate the evidence of the different mechanisms that explain rotational effects. We retrieved 44 unique publications providing 199 observations comparing continuous cereal performance with that of a grain legume-cereal rotation. The overall mean yield increase of 0.49 t grain ha(-1), equal to an increase of 41% of the continuous cereal yield, is highly significant, but the variability in residual effects is large. Effects were more pronounced in southern Africa, the highlands of East Africa and the Guinea savannah, and less in the humid forest/derived savannah of West Africa and the Sudano-Sahelian zone. Maize showed stronger yield responses after a legume than millet and sorghum. Agro-ecological zone and cereal type were however confounded. All grain legume types significantly improved cereal yields, with stronger residual effects observed after soybean and groundnut than after cowpea. Fertiliser N application to cereals reduces the residual effects of legumes, but the response at 60-120 kg N ha(-1) still equalled 0.32 t ha(-1) or 59% of the response when no N is applied. The sustained benefits with large N applications indicate the importance of non-N effects. While mechanisms for improved soil P availability after grain legumes have been studied in some detail, it remains uncertain how important these are in farmers' fields. Grain legumes are unlikely to have a major influence on the availability of nutrients other than N and P, or on soil pH. Beneficial impacts of grain legumes on soil organic matter content can occur if legumes contribute to a greater overall cropping productivity, but studies generally report no such impacts. Evidence of impacts of grain legumes on weeds is limited to striga. Studies on the impacts on nematode pressure in cereals are inconclusive, probably because legumes act as a host for some of the key nematode genera that harm maize. The impact on the pressure of other pests and diseases in cereals is probably important, but evidence on this from SSA is lacking. Future research on N-2-fixation by grain legumes and residual N benefits should focus on explaining the wide variability observed among sites. There is a clear need for more detailed mechanistic studies to assess the occurrence and relevance of non-N effects of grain legumes, particularly in relation to common pests and diseases in cereals.",Cereals; Nitrogen fixation; Phosphorus; Biotic factors; Residual benefits; Smallholder farmers

Advantages and processes for global C sequestration in AF are unknown. We used a meta-analysis of 427 soil C stock data pairs grouped into four main AF systems-alley cropping, windbreaks, silvopastures, and homegardens-and evaluated changes in AF and adjacent control cropland or pasture. Mean soil C stocks in AF (1-m depth) were 126 Mg C center dot ha(-1), which is 19% more than that in cropland or pasture. The highest C stocks in soil were in subtropical homegardens, AF with younger trees, and topsoil (0-20 cm). Increased soil C stocks in AF were lower than aboveground C stocks in most AF systems, except alley cropping. Homegardens stored the highest C in both aboveground and belowground, especially in the subsoil (20-100 cm). Advantages of AF ecosystem services focusing on mechanisms of belowground C sequestration were analyzed. AF could store 5.3 x 10(9) Mg additional C in soil on 944 Mha globally, with most in the tropics and subtropics. AF systems could greatly contribute to global soil C sequestration if used in larger areas.

378,included,Impacts of the Three-North shelter forest program on the main soil nutrients in Northern Shaanxi China: A meta-analysis,"Vegetation restoration in arid and semi-arid areas plays an extremely important role in improving the ecological environment and preventing soil erosion. The construction of the Three-North Shelter Forest (SF) in Northwestern China commenced several decades ago to increase forest productivity, improve soil fertility, and achieve better ecological benefits in arid and semi-arid zone. To date, many studies have researched the effect of SF on the soil nutrients in Northern Shaanxi, China, but their results have often been contradictory. Therefore, we could comprehensively review these studies to evaluate the impacts of SF on soil nutrients from the following three aspects: soil layer, planting year and tree species. This study compiles the results of 2308 observations from studies ranging from 1978 to 2018 to assess the effects of SF on the distribution of the soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium contents in Northern Shaanxi, China. Compared with farmland or abandoned land, the results showed that the greatest increases in the soil organic carbon (118.57%) and total nitrogen (86.19%) contents were observed in the 0–20 and 20–40 cm soil layers, respectively. However, compared with farmland or abandoned land, the greatest increases in both the soil available phosphorus (14.17%) and available potassium (71.13%) contents were observed in the 0–20 cm soil layer. Planting Pinus Sylvestris var. mongolica (PS) is more conducive for increasing the soil organic carbon (120.86%) and available phosphorus (74.33%) contents. Additionally, Pinus tabuliformis (PT) is more beneficial for increasing the soil total nitrogen content (73.82%). Meanwhile, Robinia pseudoacacia (RP) and Caragana korshinskii (CK) are more effective for increasing the available potassium (72.93%) content. This study demonstrated that soil organic carbon (104.07%), total nitrogen (130.28%), and available potassium (125.60%) contents were most affected in planting years >30 years, and the available phosphorus content was most affected in planting years 0–10 years (27.33%). In conclusion, SF can significantly increase soil nutrient contents in areas of Northern Shaanxi, China.

379,excluded,Trends and methodological impacts in soil CO2 efflux partitioning: A metaanalytical review,"Partitioning soil carbon dioxide (CO) efflux (RS) into autotrophic (RA; including plant roots and closely associated organisms) and heterotrophic (RH) components has received considerable attention, as differential responses of these components to environmental change have profound implications for the soil and ecosystem C balance. The increasing number of partitioning studies allows a more detailed analysis of experimental constraints than was previously possible. We present results of an exhaustive literature search of partitioning studies and analyse global trends in flux partitioning between biomes and ecosystem types by means of a metaanalysis. Across all data, an overall decline in the RH/RS ratio for increasing annual RS fluxes emerged. For forest ecosystems, boreal coniferous sites showed significantly higher (P<0.05) RH/RS ratios than temperate sites, while both temperate or tropical deciduous forests did not differ in ratios from any of the other forest types. While chronosequence studies report consistent declines in the RH/RS ratio with age, no difference could be detected for different age groups in the global data set. Different methodologies showed generally good agreement if the range of RS under which they had been measured was considered, with the exception of studies estimating RH by means of root mass regressions against RS, which resulted in consistently lower RH/RS estimates out of all methods included. Additionally, the time step over which fluxes were partitioned did not affect RH/RS ratios consistently. To put results into context, we review the most common techniques and point out the likely sources of errors associated with them. In order to improve soil CO efflux partitioning in future experiments, we include methodological recommendations, and also highlight the potential interactions between soil components that may be overlooked as a consequence of the partitioning process itself.",

Our meta-analysis results indicated that increasing snowpack depth significantly increased litter biomass (+18.4%), MBC (+18.2%) and CO2 emission (+15.5%), and significantly decreased litter C: N ratio (-5.8%) and total soil carbon (-28.5%) under snow addition manipulation, but did not significantly affect fine root biomass, MBC: MBN ratio and soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC). However, increasing snowpack depth only significantly altered litter C: N ratio (+11.2%) under snow removal manipulation. The different responses between snow addition and removal were possibly related to the higher soil temperature and moisture under snow addition than under snow removal manipulation experiments. In addition, the effect of increasing snowpack depth on CH4 flux was not significant, presumably because all these studies were compiled from snow-removal experiments. These results are useful for a better understanding of the effects of altered snowpack on terrestrial carbon cycling under climate change scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

381,excluded,Interactions between biochar stability and soil organisms: review and research needs,"The stability of biochar in soils is the cornerstone of the burgeoning worldwide interest in the potential of the pyrolysis/biochar platform for carbon (C) sequestration. While biochar is more recalcitrant in soil than the original organic feedstock, an increasing number of studies report greater C-mineralization in soils amended with biochar than in unamended soils. Soil organisms are believed to play a central role in this process. In this review, the variety of interactions that occur between soil micro-, meso- and macroorganisms and biochar stability are assessed. In addition, different factors reported to influence biochar stability, such as biochar physico-chemical characteristics, soil type, soil organic carbon (SOC) content and agricultural management practices are evaluated. A meta-analysis of data in the literature revealed that biochar-C mineralization rates decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature, biochar-C content and time. Enhanced release of CO2 after biochar addition to soil may result from (i) priming of native SOC pools, (ii) biodegradation of biochar components from direct or indirect stimulation of soil organisms by biochar or (iii) abiotic release of biochar-C (from carbonates or chemi-sorbed CO2). Observed biphasic mineralization rates suggest rapid mineralization of labile biochar compounds by microorganisms, with stable aromatic components decomposed at a slower rate. Comparatively little information is available on the impact of soil fauna on biochar stability in soil, although they may decrease biochar particle size and enhance its dispersion in the soil. Elucidating the impacts of soil fauna directly and indirectly on biochar stability is a top research priority.",
382,excluded,A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of diverse rhizobia inoculants on soybean traits under field conditions,"Soybean is the most widely grown legume in the world. A beneficial feature of soybean is its ability to associate with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic nitrogen (N) fixation. Here, we provide a meta-analysis of 28 peer-reviewed studies examining the effectiveness of diverse rhizobia inoculants under field conditions, with the goal of understanding the underlying factors that affect inoculant success or failure. The data demonstrate that a diversity of Bradyrhizobium and Sinorhizobium species/isolates can be effective inoculants, including some indigenous strains. These inoculants varied in their efficacy for nodule number (-28 to +178 nodules), grain yield (-34% to +109%), and grain-N yield (-6% to +176%) compared to uninoculated controls. The greatest increase in nodule numbers occurred when background nodulation by indigenous soil rhizobia was absent or extremely low. Some studies demonstrated that indigenous rhizobia strains may be better adapted to local environmental stress conditions compared to introduced rhizobia, suggesting native rhizobia may have potential for local commercialization. There was a positive but moderate correlation between inoculant-mediated increases in nodulation and grain yield/grain-N. Moderate pH conditions were critical for inoculants to improve nodulation. Inoculant success was affected by the soybean genotype and soybean x rhizobia strain interactions, inoculant titre, formulation, and application method. Potential additional explanations from the literature for the failure/success of inoculants pertain to the persistence of rhizobia (inoculants) in soil, since seed-coated rhizobia colonize roots through the rhizosphere, and furthermore stress may favor indigenous, locally-adapted competitors. Rhizobia survival in soil is strain dependent and affected by soil organic matter, nutrients, pH, salinity, agricultural practices (e.g. organic, no till, rotations, application of pesticides) as well as temperature and drought. We conclude by proposing new studies to fill current research gaps. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Soybean; Rhizobia; Inoculant; Symbiotic nitrogen fixation; Nitrogen
383,excluded,The Dynamics of Living and Dead Fine Roots of Forest Biomes across the Northern Hemisphere,"Research Highlights: A detailed picture of the seasonality in fine root biomass (FRB), necromass (FRN), and the biomass/necromass ratio (FRBN) throughout the whole year is crucial to uncover profound effects of long-term environmental changes on fine root dynamics. Materials and Methods: We used meta-analysis to characterize the variability of FRB, FRN and FRBN, and determined their relations with climatic (monthly versus annual), edaphic and geomorphic factors for tropical, temperate and boreal forest biomes across the Northern Hemisphere. Results: Boreal forests exhibited the highest FRB and FRN, while tropical forests yielded the lowest FRN, and thus the greatest FRBN. FRB and FRN significantly decreased with sampling depth, but increased with soil organic carbon content and elevation, while an opposite pattern was found for FRBN. Temperature and precipitation at different time scales (monthly versus annual) and latitude had varying influences on fine roots. High FRB and FRN were observed during dry season for tropical forests, but in the late growing season for temperate forests. The three forest biomes exhibited the high root activity (measured as FRBN) in June or July. Conclusions: It is crucial to realize the universal and specific responses of fine roots to multiple environmental factors when attempting to incorporate these parameters into fine root monthly dynamic models in forest ecosystems. The biome-specific fluctuation of fine roots contributes to identify the influence factors on fine root seasonal patterns throughout the whole year. Our analysis is expected to improve the understanding of the key role of fine roots at monthly level in modeling and predicting carbon budget of various forest biomes under future climate change.",fine root biomass; fine root necromass; forest biome; monthly; precipitation; seasonal dynamics; temperature
384,excluded,Examining the potential for climate change mitigation from zero tillage,"The benefits of reduced and zero-tillage systems have been presented as reducing runoff, enhancing water retention and preventing soil erosion. There is also general agreement that the practice can conserve and enhance soil organic carbon (C) levels to some extent. However, their applicability in mitigating climate change has been debated extensively, especially when the whole profile of C in the soil is considered, along with a reported risk of enhanced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The current paper presents a meta-analysis of existing literature to ascertain the climate change mitigation opportunities offered by minimizing tillage operations. Research suggests zero tillage is effective in sequestering C in both soil surface and sub-soil layers in tropical and temperate conditions. The C sequestration rate in tropical soils can be about five times higher than in temperate soils. In tropical soils, C accumulation is generally correlated with the duration of tillage. Reduced N2O emissions under long-term zero tillage have been reported in the literature but significant variability exists in the N2O flux information. Long-term, location-specific studies are needed urgently to determine the precise role of zero tillage in driving N2O fluxes. Considering the wide variety of crops utilized in zero-tillage studies, for example maize, barley, soybean and winter wheat, only soybean has been reported to show an increase in yield with zero tillage (77% over 10 years). In several cases yield reductions have been recorded e.g. c. 1-8% over 10 years under winter wheat and barley, respectively, suggesting zero tillage does not bring appreciable changes in yield but that the difference between the two approaches may be small. A key question that remains to be answered is: are any potential reductions in yield acceptable in the quest to mitigate climate change, given the importance of global food security?",
385,excluded,Risk factors for the perpetration of child sexual abuse: a review and meta-analysis,"Objectives: Since the late 1980s, there has been a strong theoretical focus on psychological and social influences of perpetration of child sexual abuse. This paper presents the results of a review and meta-analysis of studies examining risk factors for perpetration of child sexual abuse published since 1990. Method: Eighty-nine studies published between 1990 and April of 2003 were reviewed. Risk factors were classified into one of the following six broad categories: family factors, externalizing behaviors, internalizing behaviors, social deficits, sexual problems, and attitudes/beliefs. Sex offenders against children (SOC) were compared to three comparison groups identified within the 89 studies: sex offenders who perpetrated against adults (SOA), non-sex offenders, and non-offenders with no history of criminal or sexual behavior problems. Results: Results for the six major categories showed that SOC were not different from SOA (all d between -.02 and.14) other than showing lower externalizing behaviors (d = -.25). Sex offenders against children were somewhat different from non-sex offenders, especially with regard to sexual problems and attitudes (d =.83 and.51). Sex offenders against children showed substantial differences from non-offenders with medium sized effects in all six major categories (d's range from.39 to.58). Conclusion: Child sex offenders are different from non-sex offenders and non-offenders but not from sex offenders against adults. Practice implications: This study suggests that the presence of general risk factors may lead to a variety of negative behavioral outcomes, including the perpetration of child sexual offending. Family factors were strongly related to the perpetration of child sex offending (vs. non-sexual offending or non-offending) and may be valuable intervention points for interrupting the development of child sex offending, as well as other negative behaviors. Other potential points for intervention may focus on the development of appropriate social and emotional skills that contribute to sexual offending. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",
386,excluded,"The relationship between gsta1, gstm1, gstp1, and gstt1 genetic polymorphisms and bladder cancer susceptibility: a meta-analysis","Background:Previous studies have investigated the relationship between GSTA1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTT1 polymorphisms and bladder cancer (BCa) susceptibility, respectively, but the results remain inconsistent. So, we conducted this meta-analysis including 79 case-control studies to explore such relationships.Methods:We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Web of Science, and CNKI for relevant available studies. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were implemented to evaluate the intensity of associations. Publication bias was estimated using Begg funnel plots and Egger regression test. To assess the stability of the results, we used sensitivity analysis with the method of calculating the results again by omitting 1 single study each time. Between-study heterogeneity was tested using the I-2 statistic.Results:No significant association between GSTA1 polymorphism and BCa susceptibility (OR=1.05, 95% CI 0.83-1.33) was noted. Besides, meaningful association between individuals who carried the GSTM1 null genotype and increased BCa risk was detected (OR=1.39, 95%CI 1.28-1.51). When stratified by ethnicity, significant difference was found in both Caucasian (OR=1.39, 95% CI 1.23-1.58) and Asian populations (OR=1.45, 95% CI 1.31-1.61). Moreover, in the subgroup analysis by source of controls (SOC), the results were significant in both hospital-based control groups (OR=1.49, 95% CI 1.35-1.64) and population-based control groups (OR=1.21, 95% CI=1.07-1.37). Additionally, the analysis revealed no significant association between GSTP1 polymorphism and BCa risk (OR=1.07, 95% CI 0.96-1.20). What is more, significant associations between GSTT1 polymorphism and BCa susceptibility were discovered (OR=1.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.22). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant associations between GSTT1 null genotype and BCa risk were observed only in Caucasians (OR=1.25, 95% CI 1.09-1.44). Furthermore, when stratified by SOC, no obvious relationship was found between the GSTT1 null genotype polymorphism with hospital-based population (OR=1.11, 95% CI 0.97-1.28) or population-based population (OR=1.10, 95% CI 0.96-1.27).Conclusion:This study suggested that GSTM1 null genotype and GSTT1 null genotype might be related to higher BCa risk, respectively. However, no associations were observed between GSTA1 or GSTP1 polymorphisms and BCa susceptibility.",bladder cancer; glutathione S-transferases; meta-analysis; single gene polymorphism; susceptibility
387,excluded,Metabolic syndrome and kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background and objectives Observational studies have reported an association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and microalbuminuria or proteinuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with varying risk estimates. We aimed to systematically review the association between MetS, its components, and development of microalbuminuria or proteinuria and CKD. Design, setting, participants and measurements and population We searched MEDLINE (1966 to October 2010), SCOPUS, and the Web of Science for prospective cohort confidence interval (CI) studies that reported the development of microalbuminuria or proteinuria and/or CKD in participants with MetS. Risk estimates for eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) were extracted from individual studies and pooled using a random effects model. The results for proteinuria outcomes were not pooled because of the small number of studies. Results Eleven studies (n = 30,146) were included. MetS was significantly associated with the development of eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (odds ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.34, 1.80). The strength of this association seemed to increase as the number of components of MetS increased (trend P value = 0.02). In patients with MetS, the odds ratios (95% Cl) for development of eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) for individual components of MetS were: elevated blood pressure 1.61 (1.29, 2.01), elevated triglycerides 1.27 (1.11, 1.46), low HDL cholesterol 1.23 (1.12, 1.36), abdominal obesity 1.19 (1.05, 1.34), and impaired fasting glucose 1.14 (1.03, 1.26). Three studies reported an increased risk for development of microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria with MetS. Conclusions MetS and its components are associated with the development of eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria.

388,included,A new method for soil health assessment based on Analytic Hierarchy Process and meta-analysis,"Understanding soil health condition is essential to the sustainability and stability of the entire ecosystem of farmland. The primary objective of this study was to improve the soil health index (SHI) based on principle component analysis (PCA) and develop a new analysis method for soil health assessment based on Meta-Analytic Hierarchy Process (Meta-AHP), which provides consistent minimum data sets (MDS), weight and scoring function for different locations, studies and management. The thirteen variables of MDS that exhibited sensitivity to management between organic and conventional soil were selected by meta-analysis. The indicator weight was assigned by a combination of experts scoring, AHP and meta-analysis. To test the applicability and sensitivity of the soil health assessment by Meta-AHP, a sixteen-year long-term test was assessed by the conventional SHI method (cSHI) and Meta-AHP. The results showed that similar evaluation results and significant positive correlations (**P-<-0.01, n-=-9) between the two evaluated methods were observed, and the results calculated using Meta-AHP had the best discrimination under different plant systems due to the higher F values when compared with the cSHI. This study developed a sensitive and consistent SH assessment framework that can be used applied to a variety of location, study, and soil management systems.",
389,excluded,Effect of different fertilization modes on soil organic carbon sequestration in acid soils,"As part of a UK government funded research project to update the UK N2O inventory methodology, a systematic review of published nitrous oxide (N2O) emission factors was carried out of non-UK research, for future comparison and synthesis with the UK measurement based evidence base. The aim of the study is to assess how the UK IPCC default emission factor for N2O emissions derived from synthetic or organic fertiliser inputs (EF1) compares to international values reported in published literature. The availability of data for comparing and/or refining the UK IPCC default value and the possibility of analysing sufficient auxiliary data to propose a Tier 2 EF1, reporting strategy is evaluated. The review demonstrated a lack of consistency in reporting error bounds for fertiliser-derived EFs and N2O flux data with 8% and 44% of publications reporting EF and N2O flux error bounds respectively. There was also poor description of environmental (climate and soil) and experimental design auxiliary data. This is likely to be due to differences in study objectives, however potential improvements to soil parameter reporting are proposed. The review demonstrates that emission factors for agricultural-derived N2O emissions ranged - 0.34% to 37% showing high variation compared to the UK Tier 1 IPCC EF1 default values of 1.25% (IPCC 1996) and 1% (IPPC 2006). However, the majority (83%) of EFs reported for UK-relevant soils fell within the UK IPCC EF1 uncertainty range of 0.03% to 3%. Residual maximum likelihood (REML) analysis of the data collated in the review showed that the type and rate of fertiliser N applied and soil type were significant factors influencing EFs reported. Country of emission, the length of the measurement period, the number of splits, the crop type, pH and SOC did not have a significant impact on N2O emissions. A subset of publications where sufficient data was reported for meta-analysis to be conducted was identified. Meta-analysis of effect sizes of 41 treatments demonstrated that the application of fertiliser has a significant effect on N2O emissions in comparison to control plots and that emission factors were significantly different to zero. However no significant relationships between the quantity of fertiliser applied and the effect size of the amount of N2O emitted from fertilised plots compared to control plots were found. Annual addition of fertiliser of 35 to 557 kg N/ha gave a mean increase in emissions of 2.02 +/- 0.28 g N2O/ha/day compared to control treatments (p < 0.01). Emission factors were significantly different from zero, with a mean emission factor estimated directly from the meta analysis of 0.17 +/- 0.02%. This is lower than the IPCC 2006 Tier 1 EF1, value of 1% but falling within the uncertainty bound for the IPCC 2006 Tier 1 EF1 (0.03% to 3%). As only a small number of papers were viable for meta analysis to be conducted due to lack of reporting of the key controlling factors, the estimates of EF in this paper cannot include the true variability under conditions similar to the UK. Review-derived EFs of 0.34% to 37% and mean EF from meta-analysis of 0.17 +/- 0.02% highlight variability in reporting EFs depending on the method applied and sample size. A protocol of systematic reporting of N2O emissions and key auxiliary parameters in publications across disciplines is proposed. If adopted this would strengthen the community to inform IPCC Tier 2 reporting development and reduce the uncertainty surrounding reported UK N2O emissions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

390,excluded,Effect of telemonitoring of cardiac implantable electronic devices on healthcare utilization: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in patients with heart failure,"AimsImplantable device telemonitoring (DTM) is a diagnostic adjunct to traditional face-to-face hospital visits. Remote device follow-up and earlier diagnoses facilitated by DTM should reduce healthcare utilization. We explored whether DTM reduces healthcare utilization over standard of care (SoC), without compromising patient outcomes. Methods and resultsThis systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials on DTM in patients with heart failure consisted of 5702 patients, with a median of 117 [interquartile range (IQR) 76-331] patients per study [age 65 years (IQR 63-67)] and follow-up range of 12-36 months. DTM was associated with a reduction in total number of visits [planned, unplanned, and emergency room (ER)] [relative risk (RR) 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43-0.73, P < 0.001]. Rates of cardiac hospitalizations (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.82-1.12, P = 0.60) and the composite endpoints of ER, unplanned hospital visits, or hospitalizations (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.68-1.43, P = 0.96) was similar between the DTM and the SoC groups. An increase in the total number of ER or unscheduled visits (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.11-1.70, P = 0.004) was observed. This effect was consistent and statistically significant for all studies. Total and cardiac mortality were similar between the groups (DTM RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.69-1.16, P = 0.41; and DTM RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.51-1.69, P = 0.80). Monetary costs favoured DTM (10-55% reduction in five studies). ConclusionsCompared with SoC, DTM is associated with a marked reduction in planned hospital visits. In addition, DTM was associated with lower monetary costs, despite a modest increase in unplanned hospital and ER visits.

We discuss the history, etiology, clinical features, differential diagnoses, management, and prognosis of SOM. We conducted a meta-analysis of all 116 cases published since SOM was first described in 1906. The age at examination was 17-72 years (mean: 42 years.) There was a right-sided preponderance in 61% of cases (P < 0.02) that was statistically significant in females (63%, P < 0.04) but not in males (59%, P = 0.18). The pathophysiology of SOM may be neurovascular compression and/or ephaptic transmission. Although various pharmacological and surgical approaches to SOM treatment have been proposed, the rarity of the condition has made it impossible to conduct clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of these approaches. Recently, topical beta blockers have managed SOM symptoms in a number of cases, including the first case treated with levobunolol. Systemic medications, strabismus surgery, and neurosurgery have been used to control symptoms, with strabismus surgery carrying a moderate risk of postoperative diplopia in downgaze. Although there is no established treatment for SOM, we encourage clinicians to attempt topical levobunolol therapy before considering systemic therapy or surgery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of hydration with sodium bicarbonate for the prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). Design, setting, participants, & measurements: Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and the Internet were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing hydration between sodium bicarbonate and chloride for the prevention of CI-AKI between 1966 and November 2008. Fourteen trials that included 2290 patients were identified. There was significant heterogeneity between studies (P heterogeneity = 0.02; I(2) = 47.8%), which was largely accounted for by trial size (P = 0.016). Trials were therefore classified by size. Results: Three trials were categorized as large (n = 1145) and 12 as small (n = 1145). Among the large trials, the incidence of CI-AKI for sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride was 10.7 and 12.5%, respectively; the relative risk (RR) [95% confidence interval (CM was 0.85 (0.63 to 1.16) without evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.89, I(2) = 0%). The pooled RR (95% CI) among the 12 small trials was 0.50 (0.27 to 0.93) with significant between-trial heterogeneity (P = 0.01; I(2) = 56%). The small trials were more likely to be of lower methodological quality. Conclusions: A significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity was observed that was largely explained by trial size and published status. Among the large randomized trials there was no evidence of benefit for hydration with sodium bicarbonate compared with sodium chloride for the prevention of CI-AKI.

395,excluded,Driving fitness in different forms of dementia: an update,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Most forms of dementia are associated with progressive cognitive and noncognitive impairments that can severely affect fitness to drive. Whether safe driving is still possible in the single case, however, is often difficult to decide and may be dependent on both severity and type of the respective dementia syndrome. Particularly in early disease stages, Alzheimer disease dementia (ADD) and different types of non-Alzheimer dementias, such as vascular dementia (VaD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), might differentially affect fitness to drive. DESIGN To examine the effects of severity and type of dementia on driving fitness, we conducted a systematic review with qualitative narrative synthesis, involving different driving outcomes in different forms and stages of dementia. SETTING Literature research included MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases with a focus on the most relevant and recent publications on the topic. PARTICIPANTS The population of interest included older drivers in different stages of ADD and different forms of non-Alzheimer dementias (VaD, FTD, DLB, and PDD). MEASUREMENTS Narrative description of driving outcomes in the population of interest. RESULTS Overall, previous studies suggest that driving fitness is severely impaired in moderate and severe dementia, irrespective of the type of dementia. In milder disease stages, fitness to drive appears to be more severely impaired in non-Alzheimer dementias than in ADD, since the non-Alzheimer syndromes are not only associated with driving-relevant cognitive but noncognitive risk factors, such as behavioral or motor symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Based on these findings, practical recommendations are presented, including a risk evaluation for driving safety, depending on severity and type of different dementia syndromes.

396,included,Biochar's effect on crop productivity and the dependence on experimental conditions-a meta-analysis of literature data,"For the last decade, there has been an increasing global interest in using biochar to mitigate climate change by storing carbon in soil. However, there is a lack of detailed knowledge on the impact of biochar on the crop productivity in different agricultural systems. The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of biochar soil amendment (BSA) on crop productivity and to analyze the dependence of responses on experimental conditions. A weighted meta-analysis was conducted based on data from 103 studies published up to April, 2013. The effect of BSA on crop productivity was quantified by characterizing experimental conditions. In the published experiments, with biochar amendment rates generally < 30 t ha(-1), BSA increased crop productivity by 11.0 % on average, while the responses varied with experimental conditions. Greater responses were found in pot experiments than in field, in acid than in neutral soils, in sandy textured than in loam and silt soils. Crop response in field experiments was greater for dry land crops (10.6 % on average) than for paddy rice (5.6 % on average). This result, associated with the higher response in acid and sandy textured soils, suggests both a liming and an aggregating/moistening effect of BSA. The analysis suggests a promising role for BSA in improving crop productivity especially for dry land crops, and in acid, poor-structured soils though there was wide variation with soil, crop and biochar properties. Long-term field studies are needed to elucidate the persistence of BSA's effect and the mechanisms for improving crop production in a wide range of agricultural conditions. At current prices and C-trading schemes, however, BSA would not be cost-effective unless persistent soil improvement and crop response can be demonstrated.",C-sequestration; Soil fertility; Soil amendment; Meta-analysis; Soil; carbon

Little is known about the molecular heterogeneity in HPV-related cases. In the present study, we aim to disclose the molecular subtypes with potential biological and clinical relevance. Through a literature review, 11 studies were retrieved with a total of 346 gene-expression data points from HPV-positive HNSCC pts. Meta-analysis and self-organizing map (SOM) approaches were used to disclose relevant meta-gene portraits. Unsupervised consensus clustering provided evidence of three biological subtypes in HPV-positive HNSCC: C11, immune-related; C12, epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related; C13, proliferation-related. This stratification has a prognostic relevance, with C11 having the best outcome, C12 the worst, and C13 an intermediate survival rate. Compared to recent literature, which identified immune and keratinocyte subtypes in HPV-related HNSCC, we confirmed the former and we separated the latter into two clusters with different biological and prognostic characteristics. At present, this paper reports the largest meta-analysis of HPV-positive HNSCC studies and offers a promising molecular subtype classification. Upon further validation, this stratification could improve patient selection and pave the way for the development of a precision medicine therapeutic approach.",self-organizing map; head and neck cancer; treatment de-escalation; HP; molecular subtypes; tumor microenvironment
398,included,Denitrification in upland of China: Magnitude and influencing factors,"A better understanding of influencing factors and accurate estimate of soil denitrification is a global concern. Here we present a synthesis of 300 observations of denitrification in Chinese upland soils from 39 field and laboratory studies using the acetylene inhibition technique. The results of a linear mixed model analysis showed that the rates of soil denitrification were significantly affected by crop type, soil organic carbon, soil pH, the measurement period, and the rate of N application. The emission factor (EF) and N2O/(N2O + N-2) ratio for soil denitrification were on average 2.11 +/- 0.17% and 0.508 +/- 0.020, respectively. Our meta-analysis indicated that N fertilization increased soil denitrification by 311% (95% CI: 279-346%) and 112% (95% CI: 66-171%) in the field and laboratory studies, respectively. Substantial interactive effects between soil properties and N fertilization on soil denitrification were found. Although the highest values of both the rate of denitrification and the EF were found in vegetable fields, the size of the stimulating effect of N fertilization on soil denitrification was lower in vegetable fields than in maize and wheat fields. These results suggest that the crop-specific effect is important and that vegetable fields are potential hot spots of denitrification in Chinese uplands. Based on either the EF or the N2O/(N2O + N-2) ratio obtained, the estimated amount of total denitrification from the upland soils was an order of magnitude lower than that from budget calculations, suggesting that the acetylene inhibition technique may significantly underestimate denitrification in Chinese upland soils.",
399,excluded,Forest carbon sequestration changes in response to timber harvest,"Forest succession contributes to the global terrestrial carbon (C) sink, but changes in C sequestration in response to varied harvest intensities have been debated. The forests of the Central Appalachian region have been aggrading over the past 100 years following widespread clear-cutting that occurred in the early 1900s and these forests are now valuable timberlands. This study compared the history of ecosystem C storage in four watersheds that have been harvested at different frequencies and intensities since 1958. We compared NPP. NEP, and component ecosystem C fluxes (g C m(-2) year(-1)) in response to the four different harvest histories (no harvest, clear-cutting, single tree selection cutting, and 43 cm diameter-limit cutting) Clear-cutting had short-term negative effects on NEP but harvest did not significantly impact long-term average annual C sequestration rates. Average plant C (g C m(-2)) since 1950 was about 33% lower in response to a clear-cut event than plant C in an un-harvested forest, Suggesting that the C sequestration associated with clear-cutting practices would decline over time and result in lower C storage than diameter-limit cut, selective cut, or un-harvested forests. Total C stored over a 55-year period was stimulated similar to 37% with diameter-limit cutting and selective Cutting relative to un-harvested forests. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved",
400,included,Grazing exclusion-an effective approach for naturally restoring degraded grasslands in northern china,"Nearly 90% of the 390 million ha of grasslands in northern China are degraded. 'Grazing exclusion' has been implemented as a nature-based solution to rejuvenate degraded grasslands, but the effectiveness of the rejuvenation processes is uncertain. Here, we investigated the effects of grazing exclusion on aboveground plant community traits, soil physiochemical and biological properties, and the mechanisms responsible for enhanced grassland rejuvenation. A meta-analysis across various studies was used to assess the effectiveness. On average, grazing exclusion improved vegetation coverage by 18.5 percentage points and increased aboveground biomass by 1.13 t ha-1 and root biomass by 1.27 t ha-1, which represent an increase of 84%, 246%, and 31%, respectively, compared with continuous grazing practices. Grazing exclusion reduced soil bulk density by 13.7% and increased soil water content by 68.9%. Grasslands under grazing exclusion increased soil organic carbon (SOC) in the 0-to 15-cm depth by 3.95 (+/- 0.35 Std err) t ha-1 and total soil N, available N, and total soil P in the 0-to 40-cm depth by 2.39 (+/- 0.14), 0.83 (+/- 0.37), and 1.96 (+/- 0.44) t ha-1, respectively, compared with continuous grazing; these values represent an increase of 31%, 25%, 23%, and 14%, respectively. Prolonging the duration (years) of grazing practices enlarged the differences in SOC and soil N content between grazing exclusion and continuous grazing. Grazing exclusion has improved plant community traits and enhanced soil physiochemical and biological properties of degraded grasslands, and thus, this 'nature-based' approach can serve as an effective means to rejuvenate degraded grasslands.",grassland rejuvenation; 'nature-based' solution; plant diversity; SOC; soil biological property; soil physiochemical property
401,excluded,"A sweet deal? Sugarcane, water and agricultural transformation in sub-saharan africa","Globally, the area of sugarcane is rising rapidly in response to growing demands for bioethanol and increased sugar demand for human consumption. Despite considerable diversity in production systems and contexts, sugarcane is a particularly ""high impact"" crop with significant positive and negative environmental and socio-economic impacts. Our analysis is focused on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which is a critical region for continued expansion, due to its high production potential, low cost of production and proximity, and access, to European markets. Drawing on a systematic review of scientific evidence, combined with information from key informants, stakeholders and a research-industry workshop, we critically assess the impacts of sugarcane development on water, soil and air quality, employment, food security and human health. Our analysis shows that sugarcane production is, in general, neither explicitly good nor bad, sustainable nor unsustainable. The impacts of expansion of sugarcane production on the environment and society depend on the global political economy of sugar, local context, quality of scheme, nature of the production system and farm management. Despite threats from climate change and forthcoming changes in the trade relationship with the European Union, agricultural development policies are driving national and international interest and investment in sugarcane in SSA, with expansion likely to play an important role in sustainable development in the region. Our findings will help guide researchers and policy makers with new insights in understanding the situated environmental and social impacts associated with alternative sugar economy models, production technologies and qualities of management.

402,included,Crop rotations for increased soil carbon: perenniality as a guiding principle,"More diverse crop rotations have been promoted for their potential to remediate the range of ecosystem services compromised by biologically simplified grain-based agroecosystems, including increasing soil organic carbon (SOC). We hypothesized that functional diversity offers a more predictive means of characterizing the impact of crop rotations on SOC concentrations than species diversity per se. Furthermore, we hypothesized that functional diversity can either increase or decrease SOC depending on its associated carbon (C) input to soil. We compiled a database of 27 cropping system sites and 169 cropping systems, recorded the species and functional diversity of crop rotations, SOC concentrations (g C kg/soil), nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications (kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1)), and estimated C input to soil (Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1)). We categorized crop rotations into three broad categories: grain-only rotations, grain rotations with cover crops, and grain rotations with perennial crops. We divided the grain-only rotations into two sub-categories: cereal-only rotations and those that included both cereals and a legume grain. We compared changes in SOC and C input using mean effect sizes and 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals. Cover cropped and perennial cropped rotations, relative to grain-only rotations, increased C input by 42% and 23% and SOC concentrations by 6.3% and 12.5%, respectively. Within grain-only rotations, cereal + legume grain rotations decreased total C input (- 16%), root C input (- 12%), and SOC (- 5.3%) relative to cereal-only rotations. We found no effect of species diversity on SOC within grain-only rotations. N fertilizer rates mediated the effect of functional diversity on SOC within grain-only crop rotations: at low N fertilizer rates (<= 75 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1)), the decrease in SOC with cereal + legume grain rotations was less than at high N fertilizer rates. Our results show that increasing the functional diversity of crop rotations is more likely to increase SOC concentrations if it is accompanied by an increase in C input. Functionally diverse perennial and cover cropped rotations increased both C input and SOC concentrations, potentially by exploiting niches in time that would otherwise be unproductive, that is, increasing the ""perenniality"" of crop rotations.",biodiversity; cover crops; cropping systems; functional diversity; meta-analysis; nitrogen fertilizer; perennials; soil carbon; soil organic matter; sustainable agriculture
403,excluded,Grain size controls on cryoturbation and soil organic carbon density in permafrost-affected soils,"This meta-analysis aims to describe the relationship between grain size distributions and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in mineral subsoil and SOC-enriched cryoturbated pockets in five areas of continuous permafrost that differ in glaciation history and soil parent materials. Our results show a positive relationship between the proportion of soil particles in fine-grained fractions (colloid to medium silt) and SOC storage. Finer textured soils had significantly higher SOC storage in mineral subsoil samples (not SOC-enriched through cryoturbation) than coarser textured soils. However, the process of SOC enrichment through cryoturbation was most pronounced in soils with coarser grain sizes in the range of coarse silt and very fine sand. Although fine-grained textures provide better physical and biochemical protection for soil organic matter, their strong cohesion reduces the mixing of soil horizons and the effectiveness of cryoturbation. A higher ratio of coarse silt to clay in samples was a good predictor of SOC enrichment through cryoturbation across soil samples, soil profiles and study areas.",cryoturbation; grain size distributions; permafrost soils; SOC storage; soil parent materials; soil texture
404,excluded,Meta-analysis of relationships between environmental factors and aboveground biomass in the alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau,"The Tibetan Plateau, known as the ""world's third pole"" for its extremely harsh and fragile ecological environment, has attracted great attention because of its sensitivity to global changes. Alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau has an important function in the global carbon cycle. Many studies have examined the effects of various environmental factors on biomass distribution. In this study, the relationships between the habitat parameters and the aboveground biomass (AGB) abundance on the Tibetan Plateau were examined through a meta-analysis of 110 field sites across the widely distributed alpine steppe and meadow. The obtained data were then analysed using the classification and regression tree model and the generalized additive model. The results showed that the AGB abundance in alpine steppe was positively correlated with six environmental factors, namely, soil organic carbon density of the top soil layer from 0 cm to 30 cm (SOC30 cm), longitude, mean annual precipitation (MAP), latitude, clay, and soil moisture. For the alpine meadow, five main factors were detected, namely, altitude, soil moisture, nitrogen, MAP, and mean annual temperature. The increased AGB abundance in the alpine steppe was associated with the increased SOC30 cm, MAP, and latitude, and the increased longitude resulted in decreased AGB abundance. For the alpine meadow, altitude and soil moisture showed strongly negative effects on AGB abundance, and soil nitrogen content was positively related to the AGB distribution across all examined sites. Our results suggest the combined effects of meteorological, topographic, and soil factors on the spatial patterns of AGB on the Tibetan Plateau.",
405,included,A calculator to quantify cover crop effects on soil health and productivity,"Many producers use cover crops as a means to increase soil health and agricultural productivity, yet benefits of this practice vary depending on environmental and management conditions. In an effort to objectively evaluate how cover crops affect soil properties and crop production across climates and systems, we compiled data from 269 studies that compared cover crop treatments versus no cover crop controls. We then used t-tests and unbalanced analysis of variation tests to evaluate cover crop-related effects on 38 indicators of soil health and productivity. The t-test analysis indicated that cover cropping caused significant changes in 28 of 38 indicators, with differences seen for all physical parameters and most indicators associated with biological and environmental measurements. The unbalanced analysis of variation test allowed us to identify a hierarchy of most to least important environment and management factors for each indicator. Using this hierarchy, we developed a calculator that allows users to evaluate how cover crop usage affects 13 key indicators, including cash crop yield, weed pressure, soil aggregate stability, soil organic carbon, soil nitrogen, and infiltration rates. The calculator requires only four inputs – climatic region, soil texture group, cash crop rotation, and cover crop type – and as output provides mean percent change for each indicator based on the selected factors. The analyses produced in this study provide new insight into specific soil health and productivity responses to cover cropping, and the corresponding web-based calculator will help to ensure that soil health measurements from the field and laboratory are useful to farmers, planners, and regulators. Further, as more data becomes integrated into the calculator, results will continue to improve in accuracy and realism, ultimately helping to make soil health evaluation a practical outcome for more producers.",Conservation agriculture; Soil quality; Meta-Analysis
406,excluded,The identification of frailty: a systematic literature review,"An operational definition of frailty is important for clinical care, research, and policy planning. The literature on the clinical definitions, screening tools, and severity measures of frailty were systematically reviewed as part of the Canadian Initiative on Frailty and Aging. Searches of MEDLINE from 1997 to 2009 were conducted, and reference lists of retrieved articles were pearled, to identify articles published in English and French on the identification of frailty in community-dwelling people aged 65 and older. Two independent reviewers extracted descriptive information on study populations, frailty criteria, and outcomes from the selected papers, and quality rankings were assigned. Of 4,334 articles retrieved from the searches and 70 articles retrieved from the pearling, 22 met study inclusion criteria. In the 22 articles, physical function, gait speed, and cognition were the most commonly used identifying components of frailty, and death, disability, and institutionalization were common outcomes. The prevalence of frailty ranged from 5% to 58%. Despite significant work over the past decade, a clear consensus definition of frailty does not emerge from the literature. The definition and outcomes that best suit the unique needs of the researchers, clinicians, or policy-makers conducting the screening determine the choice of a screening tool for frailty. Important areas for further research include whether disability should be considered a component or an outcome of frailty. In addition, the role of cognitive and mood elements in the frailty construct requires further clarification. J Am Geriatr Soc 59:2129-2138, 2011.",
407,excluded,Straw Incorporation Strategy on Cereal Crop Yield in China,"Straw incorporation (SI) is considered a valid agricultural measure for ameliorating soil quality and sequestrating soil C. This study aimed to quantitatively summarize the response of cereal yield to SI management. Our results showed that compared with straw removal, SI could significantly enhance cereal yield by 7% over all of China across the 9‐yr period. In all regions, SI in coarse‐textured soils increased yields more than in fine‐textured soils. Straw incorporation resulted in greater yield increases for upland crops compared with rice (Oryza sativa L.) cropping, and for rotary tillage compared with plowing and no tillage. Overall, SI‐induced cereal yield increases were greater in areas with a lack of soil nutrients and soil water. The SI‐induced increases of 1 t ha−1 of soil organic C (SOC) storage could increase cereal yield by 44 kg ha−1. If half or full amounts of cereal straw is returned across all of China's agricultural regions, cereal yields would increase by an average of 2.84 and 5.07 Tg yr−1, respectively, which would contribute to achieving the increasing yield requirements of China.",croplands
408,excluded,Global meta-analysis of the relationship between soil organic matter and crop yields,"Resilient, productive soils are necessary to sustainably intensify agriculture to increase yields while minimizing environmental harm. To conserve and regenerate productive soils, the need to maintain and build soil organic matter (SOM) has received considerable attention. Although SOM is considered key to soil health, its relationship with yield is contested because of local-scale differences in soils, climate, and farming systems. There is a need to quantify this relationship to set a general framework for how soil management could potentially contribute to the goals of sustainable intensification. We developed a quantitative model exploring how SOM relates to crop yield potential of maize and wheat in light of co-varying factors of management, soil type, and climate. We found that yields of these two crops are on average greater with higher concentrations of SOC (soil organic carbon). However, yield increases level off at similar to 2 % SOC. Nevertheless, approximately two-thirds of the world's cultivated maize and wheat lands currently have SOC contents of less than 2 %. Using this regression relationship developed from published empirical data, we then estimated how an increase in SOC concentrations up to regionally specific targets could potentially help reduce reliance on nitrogen (N) fertilizer and help close global yield gaps. Potential N fertilizer reductions associated with increasing SOC amount to 7 % and 5 % of global N fertilizer inputs across maize and wheat fields, respectively. Potential yield increases of 10 +/- 11 % (mean +/- SD) for maize and 23 +/- 37 % for wheat amount to 32 % of the projected yield gap for maize and 60 % of that for wheat. Our analysis provides a global-level prediction for relating SOC to crop yields. Further work employing similar approaches to regional and local data, coupled with experimental work to disentangle causative effects of SOC on yield and vice versa, is needed to provide practical prescriptions to incentivize soil management for sustainable intensification.",
409,included,Global patterns of the effects of land-use changes on soil carbon stocks,"Despite hundreds of field studies and at least a dozen literature reviews, there is still considerable disagreement about the direction and magnitude of changes in soil C stocks with land use change. This paper reviews the literature on the effects of land use conversions on soil C stocks, based on a synthesis of 103 recent publications, including 160 sites in 29 countries, with the aims of determining the factors responsible for soil C sequestration and quantifying changes in soil C stocks from seven land use conversions. The results show that as an overall average across all land use change examined, land use conversions have significantly reduced soil C stocks (0.39 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Soil C stocks significantly increased after conversions from farmland to grassland (0.30 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and forest to grassland (0.68 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)), but significantly declined after conversion from grassland to farmland (0.89 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)), forest to farmland (1.74 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)), and forest to forest (0.63 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). And after conversion from farmland to forest and grassland to forest, soil C stocks did not change significantly. Globally, soil C sequestration showed a significant negative correlation with initial soil C stocks (P < 0.05), and the effects of climatic factors (mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation) on soil C sequestration varied between the land use conversion types. Also, the relationships between soil C sequestration and age since land use conversion varied in different land use change types. Generally, where the land use changes decreased soil C, the reverse process usually increased soil C stocks and vice versa. Soil C sequestration dynamics were not determined by age since land use conversion at the global level when all land use change types were combined. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Design: Thirty-seven women delivering via an emergency C-section, 21 via elective C-section and 38 through a vaginal delivery were assessed six weeks post-partum (Time 1) as to their post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms, impairment in bonding and SOC and social support. Symptoms and bonding difficulties were assessed again six weeks later (Time 2). Main and interactive effects of mode of delivery and the protective factors were examined. Main Outcome Measures: Post-natal depressive and PTSD symptoms and mother-infant bonding. Results: An emergency C-section mode of delivery predicted an increase in PTSD symptoms in Time 2, but only among women with low levels of Time-1 social support. Time-1 SOC predicted a decrease in post-natal PTSD and depression. Conclusions: Social support might buffer against the potentially traumatic effect of an emergency C-section. SOC appears to constitute a powerful dimension of post-natal resilience.",
411,excluded,Somatic mutations in breast and serous ovarian cancer young patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective: our aim was to evaluate whether somatic mutations in five genes were associated with an early age at presentation of breast cancer (BC) or serous ovarian cancer (SOC). Methods: COSMIC database was searched for the five most frequent somatic mutations in BC and SOC. A systematic review of PubMed was performed. Young age for BC and SOC patients was set at <= 35 and <= 40 years, respectively. Age groups were also classified in <30years and every 10 years thereafter. Results: twenty six (1,980 patients, 111 younger) and 16 studies (598, 41 younger), were analyzed for BC and SOC, respectively. In BC, PIK3CA wild type tumor was associated with early onset, not confirmed in binary regression with estrogen receptor (ER) status. In HER2-negative tumors, there was increased frequency of PIK3CA somatic mutation in older age groups; in ER-positive tumors, there was a trend towards an increased frequency of PIK3CA somatic mutation in older age groups. TP53 somatic mutation was described in 20% of tumors from both younger and older patients; PTEN, CDH1 and GATA3 somatic mutation was investigated only in 16 patients and PTEN mutation was detected in one of them. In SOC, TP53 somatic mutation was rather common, detected in more than 50% of tumors, however, more frequently in older patients. Conclusion: frequency of somatic mutations in specific genes was not associated with early-onset breast cancer. Although very common in patients with serous ovarian cancer diagnosed at all ages, TP53 mutation was more frequently detected in older women.",breast neoplasms; ovarian neoplasms; young adult; mutation
412,excluded,Elevated co2 alters distribution of nodal leaf area and enhances nitrogen uptake contributing to yield increase of soybean cultivars grown in mollisols,"Understanding how elevated CO2 affects dynamics of nodal leaf growth and N assimilation is crucial for the construction of high-yielding canopy via breeding and N management to cope with the future climate change. Two soybean cultivars were grown in two Mollisols differing in soil organic carbon (SOC), and exposed to ambient CO2 (380 ppm) or elevated CO2 (580 ppm) throughout the growth stages. Elevated CO2 induced 4-5 more nodes, and nearly doubled the number of branches. Leaf area duration at the upper nodes from R5 to R6 was 4.3-fold greater and that on branches 2.4-fold higher under elevated CO2 than ambient CO2, irrespective of cultivar and soil type. As a result, elevated CO2 markedly increased the number of pods and seeds at these corresponding positions. The yield response to elevated CO2 varied between the cultivars but not soils. The cultivar-specific response was likely attributed to N content per unit leaf area, the capacity of C sink in seeds and N assimilation. Elevated CO2 did not change protein concentration in seeds of either cultivar. These results indicate that elevated CO2 increases leaf area towards the upper nodes and branches which in turn contributes yield increase.",

We used a social questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), the Sense of Coherence scale (SOC), and the General Coping Questionnaire (GCQ). The PSP group had a more difficult situation with more strained economy, lower social support, more anxiety and depression, and lower SOC on both occasions. Being in the PSP group predicted experiencing a strong negative influence of the disease at follow-up. Regarding coping strategies, ""problem focusing"" decreased in both PSP and NPSP over time. ""Social trust"" and ""intrusion"" decreased only in NPSP. Otherwise the coping pattern was unchanged, with PSP showing lower scores on ""self-trust"" and ""minimization"" and higher scores on ""protest,"" ""isolation,"" and ""intrusion."" The most influenced areas at follow-up in the PSP group were work, relationship to partner and economy, and in the NPSP leisure-time activities, sexual life and work.

414,excluded,Rhizosphere priming and plant-mediated cover crop decomposition,"Rhizosphere priming occurs when plant belowground carbon (C) allocation influences the rate of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition. We investigated the effects of priming and plant-mediated cover crop decomposition on agroecosystem C and nitrogen (N) dynamics. Using C stable isotopes, we tracked C and N from corn, clover (Trifolium pratense) and rye (Secale cereale) cover crop litter, and background SOM in plots following clover, rye, or no cover crop (fallow) in 2013 and 2014. Corn enhanced the decomposition of N-rich clover cover crop litter in 2013, but there was little evidence of priming of bulk SOM decomposition. There was no corn effect on litterbag decomposition in 2014, likely due to greater soil moisture and temperature in no-corn plots. Corn N uptake per unit of corn-derived CO2 respiration was consistently lower following rye than clover and fallow, suggesting a higher C cost for corn to access N following a rye cover crop. This is one of the first field-based studies to provide evidence that plant-mediated litter decomposition potentially provides an important source of plant-available N.

Design, setting, participants, & measurements: After 1-month benazepril therapy followed by 1-month benazepril-valsartan combined therapy (run-in), 186 consenting patients with residual proteinuria >0.5 g/24 h were randomized to 6-month benazepril-valsartan therapy alone or combined with fluvastatin. Between-groups changes in proteinuria (primary outcome), serum lipids, and GFR were compared by ANCOVA. Analyses were blinded and by intention to treat. Results: During the run-in, proteinuria decreased more on benazepril-valsartan than on benazepril alone. Proteinuria reduction correlated with concomitant reduction in total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A levels. After randomization, median proteinuria similarly decreased from 1.2 (0.6 to 2.2) to 1.1 (0.5 to 1.7) g/24 h on fluvastatin and from 1.5 (0.8 to 2.7) to 1.0 (0.5 to 2.4) g/24 h on benazapril-valsartan therapy alone. Fluvastatin further reduced total and LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B versus benazepril-valsartan alone, but did not affect serum triglycerides and GFR. Treatment was well tolerated. Conclusions: In chronic kidney disease patients with residual proteinuria despite combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blockade therapy, add-on fluvastatin does not affect urinary proteins, but further reduces serum lipids and is safe. Whether combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blockade, and statin therapy may improve cardiovascular outcomes in this high-risk population is worth investigating.

416,excluded,Meta-analysis approach to assess effect of tillage on microbial biomass and enzyme activities,"Measures of soil biology are critical for the assessment of soil quality under different agricultural management practices. By modifying soil microclimate, tillage exerts the most important control on soil microbial communities. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of tillage on soil microbial biomass and enzyme activities. A meta-analysis was conducted utilizing 139 observations from 62 studies from around the world; the selected effect size (ES) was log(n) of the response ratio (RR), the mean of the tilled treatment divided by the mean of the no-till control. This ES was calculated for seven different microbial properties - microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), fluorescein diacetate (FDA), dehydrogenase (DHA), beta-glucosidase, and urease. Microbial biomass, metabolic quotient and enzyme activities were evaluated due their prevalent usage in evaluation of soil quality and use in soil quality indices. Overall, microbial biomass and all of the enzyme activities were greater under no-till compared to tillage. One exception to this was that under chisel tillage, there was no difference in MBC between the tilled plots and no-till. The qCO(2) was greater under tillage than under no-till indicating more active microbes in tilled soil, perhaps compensating for the reduced quantity. In contrast, when looking at only long-term experiments, qCO(2) was similar under both tillage and no-till, which may indicate that eventually microbes in no-till plots become as active as those in tilled plots even with the larger microbial community. The findings of this study illustrate that no-till and even reduced tillage, such as chisel tillage, promote larger microbial communities and greater enzymatic activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on models of belief threat, we examined whether the causal relationship between perceived injustice and increases in BJW could extend from the laboratory to society by using macro-economic injustice trends to predict changes in BJW across these decades. Specifically, we hypothesized that perceptions of inequality, operationalized as rising income disparities, would result in a greater need to justify this inequality and that this would be evidenced by increased commitment to just world beliefs over time. Consistent with this prediction, BJW scores increased significantly over time and this increase was positively related to increasing income disparities in society. Income inequality remained a significant predictor of BJW scores even after controlling for additional factors of general income and political ideology. Implications of increasing just world beliefs are discussed in terms of psychological and policy outcomes.",

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials that assessed adverse events (AEs) with topical NSAIDs in patients with OA were eligible for inclusion. Authors and/or study sponsors were contacted to obtain the full report of AEs. The primary outcomes were overall severe and serious AEs, as well as the following MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC)-related AEs: gastrointestinal, vascular, cardiac, nervous system, skin and subcutaneous tissue, musculoskeletal and connective tissue.ResultsThe search strategy identified 1209 records, from which 25 papers were included in the qualitative synthesis and 19 were included in the meta-analysis, after exclusions. Overall, more total AEs (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.29; I-2=0.0%) and more withdrawals due to AEs (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.15-1.92; I-2=0.0%) were observed with topical NSAIDs compared with placebo. The same results were achieved with topical diclofenac, largely driven by an increase in skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (OR 1.73, 95% CI 0.96-3.10), although the difference was not statistically significant compared with placebo. No significant difference in the odds for gastrointestinal disorders was observed between topical NSAIDs and placebo (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73-1.27).ConclusionsTopical NSAIDs may be considered safe in the management of OA, especially with regard to low gastrointestinal toxicity. The use of topical NSAIDs in OA should be considered, taking into account their risk: benefit profile in comparison with other anti-OA treatments.",
419,excluded,Effect of harvest residue management on tree productivity and carbon pools during early stand development in a loblolly pine plantation,"Soil incorporation of postharvest forest floor or logging residues during site preparation increased mineral soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentration and had a differential effect on early stand growth in a clonal loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantation. Incorporating 25 Mg ha(-1) of forest floor (FF) (C/N ratio approximate to 112:1) or 25 (1LR) or 50 (2LR) Mg ha(-1) masticated logging residues (C/N ratio approximate to 856:1) increased soil C concentration by 24-49% in the top 60 cm of soil compared with that for a nontreated control or a raked (R) treatment where the forest floor (-25 Mg ha(-1)) was removed. Although the long-term treatment effects on soil C are unknown, increased macro-organic matter C (150-2,000 mu m) in the recalcitrant heavy fraction coupled with an estimated 20- to 35-year turnover rate for the incorporated residues suggests that soil C will be elevated in the FF, 1LR, and 2LR treatments through the current rotation. There was a treatment X age interaction on stand volume growth (P = 0.03) caused by a differential response to FF and LR treatments. Relative to the control, the FF treatment increased stem volume growth and stand homogeneity, resulting in 18% more stand volume at age 6. In contrast, the LR treatments initially suppressed volume growth; however, at age 6 there were no significant differences in stem volume among control and LR treatments. Six-year stand volume was 116.6, 112.6, 135.1, 116.0, and 112.3 (SE 3.6) m(3) ha(-1) in the control, R, FF, 1LR, and 2LR treatments, respectively. Whereas the efficacy of organic matter management will be site-dependent, our results suggest that soil incorporation of forest residues during site preparation can have positive benefits for productivity and building soil C on sites with relatively high inherent soil C stocks.

420,excluded,Riparian reforestation: are there changes in soil carbon and soil microbial communities?,"Reforestation of pastures in riparian zones has the potential to decrease nutrient runoff into waterways, provide both terrestrial and aquatic habitat, and help mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon (C). Soil microbes can play an important role in the soil C cycle, but are rarely investigated in studies on C sequestration. We surveyed a chronosequence (0-23 years) of mixed-species plantings in riparian zones to investigate belowground (chemical and biological) responses to reforestation. For each planting, an adjacent pasture was surveyed to account for differences in soil type and land-use history among plantings. Two remnant woodlands were included in the survey as indicators of future potential of plantings. Both remnant woodlands had significantly higher soil organic C (SOC) content compared with their adjacent pastures. However, there was no clear trend in SOC content among plantings with time since reforestation. The substantial variability in SOC sequestration among plantings was possibly driven by differences in soil moisture among plantings and the inherent variability of SOC content among reference pastures adjacent to plantings. Soil microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA, an indicator of microbial biomass) and activities of decomposition enzymes (beta-glucosidase and polyphenol oxidase) did not show a clear trend with increasing planting age. Despite this, there were positive correlations between total SOC concentration and microbial indicators (total PLFA, fungal PLFA, bacterial PLFA and activities of decomposition enzymes) across all sites. The soil microbial community compositions (explored using PLFA markers) of older plantings were similar to those of remnant woodlands. There was a positive correlation between the soil carbon: nitrogen (C:N) and fungal: bacterial (F:B) ratios. These data indicate that in order to maximise SOC sequestration, we need to take into account not only C inputs, but the microbial processes that regulate SOC cycling as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The desire to improve upon the apparent good performance of NB while maintaining its efficiency and simplicity is demonstrated by the variety of adaptations to NB in the literature. This study takes a look at 37 such adaptations. The idea is to give a qualitative overview of the adaptations rather than a quantitative analysis of their performance. Landscapes are produced using Sammon mapping, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Self-Organising feature Maps (SOM). Based on these, the methods are split into five main groups-tree structures, feature selection, space transformation, Bayesian networks and joint features. The landscapes can also be used for placing any new variant of NB to obtain its nearest neighbours as an aid for comparison studies.",
422,included,Livestock grazing alters multiple ecosystem properties and services in salt marshes: a meta-analysis,"1. The far-reaching impacts of livestock grazing in terrestrial grasslands are widely appreciated, but how livestock affect the structure and functions of sensitive coastal ecosystems has hitherto lacked synthesis. Grazing-induced changes in salt marshes have the potential to alter the provision of valuable ecosystem services, such as coastal protection, blue carbon and biodiversity conservation. 2. To investigate how livestock alter soil, vegetation and faunal properties in salt marshes, we conducted a global meta-analysis of ungulate grazer impacts on commonly measured ecosystem properties (498 individual responses from 89 studies). We also tested stocking density, grazing duration, grazer identity, continent and vegetation type as potential modifiers of the grazing effect. The majority of studies were conducted in Europe (75) or the Americas (12), and investigated cattle (43) or sheep (22) grazing. 3. All measures of above-ground plant material (height, cover, above-ground biomass, litter) were decreased by grazing, potentially impairing coastal protection through diminished wave attenuation. 4. Soil carbon was reduced by grazing in American, but not European marshes, indicating a trade-off with climate regulation that varies geographically. Additionally, grazing increased soil bulk density, salinity and daytime temperature, and reduced redox potential. 5. Biodiversity responses depended on focal group, with positive effects of grazing on vegetation species richness, but negative effects on invertebrate richness. Grazing reduced the abundance of herbivorous invertebrates, which may affect fish and crustaceans that feed in the marsh. Overall vertebrate abundance was not affected, but there was provisional evidence for increases over a longer duration of grazing, potentially increasing birdwatching and wildfowling opportunities. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that the use of salt marshes for livestock production affects multiple ecosystem properties, creating trade-offs and synergies with other ecosystem services. Grazing leads to reductions in blue carbon in the Americas but not in Europe. Grazing may compromise coastal protection and the provision of a nursery habitat for fish while creating provisioning and cultural benefits through increased wildfowl abundance. These findings can inform salt marsh grazing management, based on local context and desired ecosystem services.",biodiversity; blue carbon; cattle; coastal protection; ecosystem service trade-offs; grasslands; horses; sheep; soil; vegetation
423,excluded,Microencapsulation of fish oil - determination of optimal wall material and encapsulation methodology,"For the first time, we present a meta-analysis of experimental and literature data to determine which micro encapsulation methodology, and which wall material are best suited to protect fish oil. Our analysis covered a period of several decades of research (1984-2018). The analysis was conducted on 196 literature data-points, and 16 data-points determined experimentally for this publication. PLS regression was used to determine the influence of the predictors, with a variety of rational (k-means, Kohonen SOM, and Kennard-Stone) and random training/test division methods. Analysis of the applicability domain, determined by calculating the convex hull of the points, clearly showed that rational division methods are better than random division. It was found, that spray-granulation is best suited to protect fish oil. On the other hand, the commonly cited method of spray-drying performs quite badly. In addition, we found that the best wall materials are protein + lipid + carbohydrate and protein + lipid. The commonly used protein + carbohydrate again fared poorly. Meta-analysis such as these are crucial for the overview of methods and materials employed in the design of functional foods.",Fish oil; Microencapsulation; PLS regression; Rational division; Wall material
424,excluded,A global analysis of soil acidification caused by nitrogen addition,"Nitrogen (N) deposition-induced soil acidification has become a global problem. However, the response patterns of soil acidification to N addition and the underlying mechanisms remain far from clear. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 106 studies to reveal global patterns of soil acidification in responses to N addition. We found that N addition significantly reduced soil pH by 0.26 on average globally. However, the responses of soil pH varied with ecosystem types, N addition rate, N fertilization forms, and experimental durations. Soil pH decreased most in grassland, whereas boreal forest was not observed a decrease to N addition in soil acidification. Soil pH decreased linearly with N addition rates. Addition of urea and NH4NO3 contributed more to soil acidification than NH4-form fertilizer. When experimental duration was longer than 20 years, N addition effects on soil acidification diminished. Environmental factors such as initial soil pH, soil carbon and nitrogen content, precipitation, and temperature all influenced the responses of soil pH. Base cations of Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+ were critical important in buffering against N-induced soil acidification at the early stage. However, N addition has shifted global soils into the Al3+ buffering phase. Overall, this study indicates that acidification in global soils is very sensitive to N deposition, which is greatly modified by biotic and abiotic factors. Global soils are now at a buffering transition from base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+) to non-base cations (Mn2+ and Al3+). This calls our attention to care about the limitation of base cations and the toxic impact of nonbase cations for terrestrial ecosystems with N deposition.",
425,excluded,Rhizosphere priming effect: A meta-analysis,"Rhizosphere priming is crucial for regulating soil carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles. An appreciable number of studies have been conducted to quantify the rhizosphere priming effect (RPE), and have shown that the RPE is sensitive to changes of plant and soil conditions. These diverse results across individual studies offer us an opportunity to explore for potential general patterns and variability. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of RPE values taken from 31 publications. Our results showed that, on average, the RPE enhanced soil organic carbon mineralization rate by 59% across all studies. The magnitudes of the RPE significantly varied among plant types and soil texture. Within plant types, woody species showed the highest RPE followed by grasses while crops had the lowest level of the RPE, indicating that plant traits and physiology may exert important controls on the RPE. Soils with finer texture tended to produce stronger RPEs than soils with coarser texture, suggesting that interactions between the rhizosphere and the soil matrix may modulate the RPE. Furthermore, the level of the RPE is positively correlated with aboveground plant biomass, but surprisingly not with root biomass which is the commonly believed key variable for influencing the RPE. In addition, the RPE increased with the length of experimental duration, which implies that the RPE may persist much longer than previously believed because it impacts stabilized soil carbon more than labile carbon as the length of experimental duration increases. Overall, the results from this meta-analysis further illustrate several complex features of the RPE and call for future attentions to decipher this complexity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

426,included,The effects of forest restoration on ecosystem carbon in western north america: a systematic review,"Ecological restoration has become an overarching management paradigm for sustaining the health and resilience of forests across western North America. Restoration often involves mechanical thinning to promote development of complex habitats in moist, productive forests and mechanical thinning with prescribed fire to reduce fuels and restore natural disturbance regimes in dry, fire prone forests. This systematic review quantified the impact of restoration treatments on forest ecosystem carbon (C) stocks and identified factors that moderate treatment effects across spatial and temporal scales. Our review process identified 73 studies to be included for analysis, from which we calculated 482 estimates of treatment effect size. We found that restoration treatments significantly reduce C. Prescribed fire had larger impacts on belowground than aboveground carbon pools, while thinning and combined treatments had larger impacts on aboveground pools. The available literature is highly skewed toward shorter timescales ( < 25 years after treatment), small spatial scales, and is geographically concentrated: 41% of estimated effect sizes came from studies in the Sierra Nevada. Thinning had similar effects on forest carbon in dry forests and moist forests. The relative magnitude of total C losses was significantly less from simulation than empirical studies, although simulations also mostly evaluated long-term impacts ( > 75 years after treatment) while empirical studies mostly looked at short term ( < 25 year) effects. Post-treatment wildfire significantly reduced the percentage of carbon lost relative to controls in the aboveground pool. Long-term, treated stands only recovered to control levels of carbon when wildfire was present. Returns on the carbon debt imposed by thinning and prescribed fire depend on the nuances of the treatments themselves but may also depend upon treatment intensity and the frequency and intensity of future wildfire. Ecological restoration in forests across the western US has to carefully balance the budget of ecosystem carbon with competing objectives such as improved wildlife habitat, reduced risk of severe wildfire, and other ecosystem services.",Pacific Northwest; Ecosystem services; Silviculture; Forest restoration; Carbon budget; Forest carbon; Climate change mitigation
427,excluded,"Change in soil organic carbon between 1981 and 2011 in croplands of heilongjiang province, northeast china","BACKGROUNDSoil organic carbon (SOC) is fundamental for mitigating climate change as well as improving soil fertility. Databases of SOC obtained from soil surveys in 1981 and 2011 were used to assess SOC change (0-20cm) in croplands of Heilongjiang Province in northeast China. Three counties (Lindian, Hailun and Baoqing) were selected as typical croplands representing major soil types and land use types in the region. RESULTSThe changes in SOC density (SOCD) between 1981 and 2001 were -6.6, -14.7 and 5.7Mg C ha(-1) in Lindian, Hailun and Baoqing Counties respectively. The total SOC storage (SOCS) changes were estimated to be -11.3, -19.1 and 16.5% of those in 1981 in the respective counties. The results showed 22-550% increases in SOCS in rice (Oryza sativa L.) paddies in the three counties, but 28-33% decreases in dry cropland in Lindian and Hailun Counties. In addition, an increase of 11.4Mg C ha(-1) in SOCD was observed in state-owned farms (P < 0.05), whereas no significant change was observed in family-owned farms. CONCLUSIONSoil C:N ratio and initial SOCD related to soil groups were important determinants of SOCD changes. Land use and residue returning greatly affected SOC changes in the study region. To increase the topsoil SOCD, the results suggest the conversion of dry croplands to rice paddies and returning of crop residue to soils.

428,included,The effect of no-till on organic C storage in Chinese soils should not be overemphasized: A meta-analysis,"No-till (NT) has been widely regarded as a potential option to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and thus mitigate climate change. However, recent studies have shown that previous estimates of SOC storage under NT seem to be overestimated due to shallow sampling and improper SOC accounting. In China, the overall trend and magnitude of changes in SOC storage in response to NT adoption remain inconclusive. Here we use a meta-analysis to assess the relative change in SOC storage (profiles >= 20 cm) based on 95 comparisons between NT and conventional tillage (CT) from 57 experimental sites (>= 3 years) covering various cropping systems, soil types, and climatic regions of China. The results revealed that compared to CT, adopting NT led to SOC accumulation in the upper 20 cm layer and SOC depletion in the 30-40 cm layer. On average, NT improved SOC stocks over CT by 3.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4%-6.3%; P=0.005] and 5.1% (95%CI: 2.5%-7.7%; P < 0.001) as represented by the equivalent soil mass (ESM) and fixed-depth (FD) approaches, respectively. The relative change in SOC storage rate under NT over tilled soil for the top 30 cm layer was therefore significantly higher (Mean: 0.300 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), 95%CI: 0.054-0.547; P < 0.001) calculated by FD approach than that by ESM (Mean: 0.141 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), 95%CI: -0.102-0384; P=0.100). Further analysis suggested that the effect of NT on SOC storage was significant with residue retained, double cropping systems, and in the coarse textured soils. We conclude that although NT was an effective agronomy option for soil conservation in China, the potential for mitigation climate change through increased SOC sequestration by NT should not be amplified.

429,excluded,Sense of coherence and self-sacrificing defense style as predictors of psychological distress and quality of life in rheumatoid arthritis: a 5-year prospective study,"Individual differences in adjustment during a disease's course determine psychological response and outcome. This study aimed to investigate prospectively whether coping with health stressors and self-sacrificing defense style could predict psychological adjustment and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Seventy-four consecutive RA patients attending a rheumatology clinic were assessed for psychological distress (SCL-90-R), sense of coherence (SOC scale), self-sacrificing defense style (Defense Style Questionnaire-88), disease activity (DAS-28), pain, disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire) and HRQoL (World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument, Short Form) at baseline and 5 years later. Multiple regression and moderator analyses were carried out. The results showed that disease activity (p < .001), pain (p = .005), psychological distress (p = .031), social relations HRQoL (p = .042) and environment HRQoL (p = .020) significantly improved over time. SOC was found an independent predictor of improvement in psychological distress (p = .003), overall general health (p = .002) and social relations HRQoL (p = .004); self-sacrificing independently predicted environment HRQoL (p = .042). The self-sacrificing defense style moderated the relationships between improvement in pain and improvement in overall general health (p = .024) and between improvement in pain and improvement in social relations HRQoL (p = .006). These findings indicate that, in RA, SOC predicts improvement in psychological distress and HRQoL over time, while a self-sacrificing defense style moderates the relationship of pain with HRQoL in the long term. These variables may partly explain inter-individual differences in adaptation to RA. Therefore, the design of psychotherapeutic trials targeting the patients' defensive profiles and coping with health stressors capacities is an important research perspective.",
430,excluded,"Allometric constraints on, and trade-offs in, belowground carbon allocation and their control of soil respiration across global forest ecosystems","To fully understand how soil respiration is partitioned among its component fluxes and responds to climate, it is essential to relate it to belowground carbon allocation, the ultimate carbon source for soil respiration. This remains one of the largest gaps in knowledge of terrestrial carbon cycling. Here, we synthesize data on gross and net primary production and their components, and soil respiration and its components, from a global forest database, to determine mechanisms governing belowground carbon allocation and their relationship with soil respiration partitioning and soil respiration responses to climatic factors across global forest ecosystems. Our results revealed that there are three independent mechanisms controlling belowground carbon allocation and which influence soil respiration and its partitioning: an allometric constraint; a fine-root production vs. root respiration trade-off; and an above- vs. belowground trade-off in plant carbon. Global patterns in soil respiration and its partitioning are constrained primarily by the allometric allocation, which explains some of the previously ambiguous results reported in the literature. Responses of soil respiration and its components to mean annual temperature, precipitation, and nitrogen deposition can be mediated by changes in belowground carbon allocation. Soil respiration responds to mean annual temperature overwhelmingly through an increasing belowground carbon input as a result of extending total day length of growing season, but not by temperature-driven acceleration of soil carbon decomposition, which argues against the possibility of a strong positive feedback between global warming and soil carbon loss. Different nitrogen loads can trigger distinct belowground carbon allocation mechanisms, which are responsible for different responses of soil respiration to nitrogen addition that have been observed. These results provide new insights into belowground carbon allocation, partitioning of soil respiration, and its responses to climate in forest ecosystems and are, therefore, valuable for terrestrial carbon simulations and projections.",
431,excluded,Different responses of soil respiration and its components to nitrogen addition among biomes: a meta-analysis,"Abstract Anthropogenic activities have increased nitrogen (N) deposition by threefold to fivefold over the last century, which may considerably affect soil respiration (Rs). Although numerous individual studies and a few meta-analyses have been conducted, it remains controversial as to how N addition affects Rs and its components [i.e., autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh)]. To reconcile the difference, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 295 published studies to examine the responses of Rs and its components to N addition in terrestrial ecosystems. We also assessed variations in their responses in relation to ecosystem types, environmental conditions, and experimental duration (DUR). Our results show that N addition significantly increased Rs by 2.0% across all biomes but decreased by 1.44% in forests and increased by 7.84% and 12.4% in grasslands and croplands, respectively (P < 0.05). The differences may largely result from diverse responses of Ra to N addition among biomes with more stimulation of Ra in croplands and grasslands compared with no significant change in forests. Rh exhibited a similar negative response to N addition among biomes except that in croplands, tropical and boreal forests. Methods of partitioning Rs did not induce significant differences in the responses of Ra or Rh to N addition, except that Ra from root exclusion and component integration methods exhibited the opposite responses in temperate forests. The response ratios (RR) of Rs to N addition were positively correlated with mean annual temperature (MAT), with being more significant when MAT was less than 15 °C, but negatively with DUR. In addition, the responses of Rs and its components to N addition largely resulted from the changes in root and microbial biomass and soil C content as indicated by correlation analysis. The response patterns of Rs to N addition as revealed in this study can be benchmarks for future modeling and experimental studies.",autotrophic respiration; experimental duration; heterotrophic; respiration; mean annual temperature; nitrogen fertilization; soil; respiration
432,excluded,A practical approach to assessing and mitigating loneliness and isolation in older adults,"Loneliness and social isolation are strongly associated with several adverse health outcomes in older persons including death and functional impairments. The strength of these associations has been compared with smoking. Accordingly, loneliness and isolation have significant public health implications. Despite the adverse impacts of loneliness and social isolation on quality of life, and their strong association with health outcomes, the evaluation of loneliness and isolation have not been integrated into medical care. The risks for loneliness may be of particular concern to persons with serious illness as patients and caregivers cope with the experience of loss, loss of independence, and increasing care needs. To date, there has been no uniform way of evaluating and documenting loneliness and social isolation as a part of a review of a patient's social determinants of health. This article provides a framework for healthcare systems, providers, and community members working with older adults to (1) understand loneliness, isolation, and its counterpart social connection; (2) describe the different ways loneliness affects health; and (3) create a framework for asking about and documenting these experiences. Finally, because the lack of studies assessing whether targeting loneliness can improve health outcomes is a major gap, we provide guidance on the future of interventions.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed. Design, setting, participants, & measurements The Cochrane Library, PUBMED, EMBASE, Chinese Database, and Clinical Trial Registries (June 2012) were searched to identify RCTs investigating the effect of immunosuppression on adults with IMN and nephrotic syndrome. Results This review was an update (36 RCTs, 1762 participants) of the 2004 version (18 RCTs, 1025 participants). Immunosuppression significantly reduced all-cause mortality or ESRD (15 RCTs, 791 participants; risk ratio, 0.58 [95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.95]; P=0.03). However, the result was not consistent when prespecified subgroup analyses were undertaken. Immunosuppression increased complete or partial remission (CR + PR) (16 RCTs, 864 participants; 1.31 [1.01-1.70]; P=0.04) but resulted in more withdrawals or hospitalizations (16 RCTs, 880 participants; 5.35 [2.19-13.02]; P=0.002). Corticosteroids combined with alkylating agents significantly reduced all-cause mortality or ESRD (8 RCTs, 448 participants; 0.44 [0.26-0.75]; P=0.002) and increased CR + PR (7 RCTs, 422 participants; 1.46 [1.13-1.89]; P=0.004) but led to more adverse events (4 RCTs, 303 participants; 4.20 [1.15-15.32]; P=0.03). Cyclophosphamide was safer than chlorambucil (3 RCTs, 147 participants; 0.48 [0.26-0.90]; P=0.02). Cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil failed to show superiority over alkylating agents.

434,included,Changes in soil organic carbon under eucalyptus plantations in brazil: a comparative analysis,"Proper assessment of environmental quality or degradation requires knowledge of how terrestrial C pools respond to land use change. Forest plantations offer a considerable potential to sequester C in aboveground biomass. However, their impact on initial levels of soil organic carbon (SOC) varies from strong losses to gains, possibly affecting C balances in afforestation or reforestation initiatives. We compiled paired-plot studies on how SOC stocks under native vegetation change after planting fast-growth Eucalyptus species in Brazil, where these plantations are becoming increasingly important. SOC changes for the 0-20 and 0-40cm depths varied between -25 and 42Mgha(-1), following a normal distribution centered near zero. After replacing native vegetation by Eucalyptus plantations, mean SOC changes were -15 and 03Mgha(-1) for the 0-20 and 0-40cm depths, respectively. These are very low figures in comparison to C stocks usually sequestered in aboveground biomass and were statistically nonsignificant as demonstrated by a t-test at p<005. Similar low, nonsignificant SOC changes were estimated after data were stratified into first or second rotation cycles, soil texture and biome (savanna, rainforest or grassland). Although strong SOC losses or gains effectively occurred in some cases, their underpinning causes could not be generally identified in the present work and must be ascribed in a case basis, considering the full set of environmental and management conditions. We conclude that Eucalyptus spp. plantations in average have no net effect on SOC stocks in Brazil.

With a double-blind, parallel-group design, the effects of 3 different combinations, carvedilol controlled-release (CR)/lisinopril, atenolol/lisinopril, and lisinopril, on left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were assessed by MRI after 12 months. Patients were treated to achieve guideline-recommended BP (<140 mm Hg/<90 mm Hg; diabetes: <130 mm Hg/<80 mm Hg). Sample size was calculated to achieve 90% power to detect a 5 g/m(2) difference in mean change from baseline in LVMI between the carvedilol CR/lisinopril group and each of the other treatment groups. Of 287 patients randomized, more than 50% were titrated to maximum dosage; 73% reached targeted BP.

DESIGN: A systematic review of the medical literature identified from searches of databases, reference lists, and recent conference proceedings with qualitative assessment of the desired end points. SETTING: Not applicable. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 50 and older. INTERVENTIONS: Oral DHEA supplement with or without concomitant exercise. MEASUREMENTS: Muscle strength, physical function, and physical performance. RESULTS: Of the 155 eligible studies, eight (n = 661 participants) met inclusion criteria. The studies differed in their included populations, duration of follow-up, and interventions (e.g., exercise). Seven studies examined measures of muscle strength. One study showed improvement in hand-grip strength, one showed improvement in chest press, two showed improvement in leg press, and one showed improvement in knee extension and flexion. Nevertheless, similar numbers of studies had negative results for each of these endpoints. Five studies examined measures of physical function and performance. Only one study showed improvement in a composite score measuring physical performance; the rest reported no differences between DHEA and control for any end point. CONCLUSION: Overall, the benefit of DHEA on muscle strength and physical function in older adults remains inconclusive. Some measures of muscle strength may improve, although consensus was not reached. DHEA does not appear to routinely benefit measures of physical function or performance. Further large clinical trials are necessary to better identify the clinical role of DHEA supplementation in this population. J Am Geriatr Soc 59:997-1002, 2011.",
437,excluded,Resource-ratio theory predicts mycorrhizal control of litter decomposition,"Ecosystems with ectomycorrhizal plants have high soil carbon : nitrogen ratios, but it is not clear why. The Gadgil effect, where competition between ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi for nitrogen slows litter decomposition, may increase soil carbon. However, experimental evidence for the Gadgil effect is equivocal. Here, we apply resource-ratio theory to assess whether interguild fungal competition for different forms of organic nitrogen can affect litter decomposition. We focus on variation in resource input ratios and fungal resource use traits, and evaluate our model's predictions by synthesizing prior experimental literature examining ectomycorrhizal effects on litter decomposition. In our model, resource input ratios determined whether ectomycorrhizal fungi suppressed saprotrophic fungi. Recalcitrant litter inputs favored the former over the latter, allowing the Gadgil effect only when such inputs predominated. Although ectomycorrhizal fungi did not always hamper litter decomposition, ectomycorrhizal nitrogen uptake always increased carbon : nitrogen ratios in litter. Our meta-analysis of empirical studies supports our theoretical results: ectomycorrhizal fungi appear to slow decomposition of leaf litter only in forests where litter inputs are highly recalcitrant. We thus find that the specific contribution of the Gadgil effect to high soil carbon : nitrogen ratios in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems may be smaller than predicted previously.",biogeochemistry; forest ecology; Gadgil effect; litter decomposition; mycorrhizal fungi; nitrogen limitation; resource-ratio theory
438,included,Higher yields and lower methane emissions with new rice cultivars,"There are many environmental benefits to incorporating cover crops into crop rotations, such as their potential to decrease soil erosion, reduce nitrate (NO3) leaching, and increase soil organic matter. Some of these benefits impact other agroecosystem processes, such as greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, there is not a consensus in the literature regarding the effect of cover crops on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Compared to site-specific studies, meta-analysis can provide a more general investigation into these effects. Twenty-six peer-reviewed articles including 106 observations of cover crop effects on N2O emissions from the soil surface were analyzed according to their response ratio, the natural log of the N2O flux with a cover crop divided by the N2O flux without a cover crop (LRR). Forty percent of the observations had negative LRRs, indicating a cover crop treatment which decreased N2O, while 60% had positive LRRs indicating a cover crop treatment which increased N2O. There was a significant interaction between N rate and the type of cover crop where legumes had higher LRRs at lower N rates than nonlegume species. When cover crop residues were incorporated into the soil, LRRs were significantly higher than those where residue was not incorporated. Geographies with higher total precipitation and variability in precipitation tended to produce higher LRRs. Finally, data points measured during cover crop decomposition had large positive LRRs and were larger than those measured when the cover crop was alive. In contrast, those data points measuring for a full year had LRRs close to zero, indicating that there was a balance between periods when cover crops increased N2O and periods when cover crops decreased emissions. Therefore, N2O measurements over the entire year may be needed to determine the net effect of cover crops on N2O. The data included in this meta-analysis indicate some overarching crop management practices that reduce direct N2O emissions from the soil surface, such as no soil incorporation of residues and use of nonlegume cover crop species. However, our results demonstrate that cover crops do not always reduce direct N2O emissions from the soil surface in the short term and that more work is needed to understand the full global warming potential of cover crop management.",paddy fields
439,excluded,Social and ecological analysis of commercial integrated crop livestock systems: current knowledge and remaining uncertainty,"Crops and livestock play a synergistic role in global food production and farmer livelihoods. Increasingly, however, crops and livestock are produced in isolation, particularly in farms operating at the commercial scale. It has been suggested that re-integrating crop and livestock systems at the field and farm level could help reduce the pollution associated with modern agricultural production and increase yields. Despite this potential, there has been no systematic review to assess remaining knowledge gaps in both the social and ecological dimensions of integrated crop and livestock systems (ICLS), particularly within commercial agricultural systems. Based on a multi-disciplinary workshop of international experts and additional literature review, we assess the current knowledge and remaining uncertainties about large-scale, commercial ICLS and identify the source of remaining knowledge gaps to establish priorities for future research. We find that much is understood about nutrient flows, soil quality, crop performance, and animal weight gain in commercial ICLS, but there is little knowledge about its spatial extent, animal behavior or welfare in ICLS, or the tradeoffs between biodiversity, pest and disease control, greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, and drought and heat tolerance in ICLS. There is some evidence regarding the economic outcomes in commercial ICLS and supply chain and policy barriers to adoption, but little understanding of broader social outcomes or cultural factors influencing adoption. Many of these knowledge gaps arise from a basic lack of data at both the field and system scales, which undermines both statistical analysis and modeling efforts. Future priorities for the international community of researchers investigating the tradeoffs and scalability of ICLS include: methods standardization to better facilitate international collaborations and comparisons, continued social organization for better data utilization and collaboration, meta-analyses to answer key questions from existing data, the establishment of long term experiments and surveys in key regions, a portal for citizen science, and more engagement with ICLS farmers.",Food systems; Agroecology; Sustainable agriculture; Mixed crop livestock; Ecosystem services
440,excluded,Systematic review and meta-analysis: do clinical trials testing antimuscarinic agents for overactive bladder adequately measure central nervous system adverse events?,"Experimental studies in healthy volunteers suggest that some antimuscarinic agents confer a risk of cognitive impairment, yet clinical trials of people with overactive bladder report only rare central nervous system (CNS) side effects. A lack of systematic measurement and reporting of CNS outcomes in clinical trials may partially explain this discrepancy. The purpose of this review and meta-analysis was to ascertain the reporting bias associated with adverse CNS events in clinical drug trials of younger and older adults with overactive bladder. Articles were identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases until 2010 using the search terms ""clinical trial'' AND (one of) ""oxybutynin, tolterodine, fesoterodine, propiverine, solifenacin, darifenacin, and trospium.'' Eligibility criteria included original randomized trials involving adults with overactive bladder; standard doses of medication; reports of confusion, somnolence, sedation, dizziness, drowsiness, asthenia, insomnia, and vertigo; no evidence of dementia at baseline; and trials in English. Seventy-seven percent (242/314) of eligible trials identified in the search neither measured nor reported CNS outcomes. Of the remaining 23%, it was difficult to distinguish whether CNS adverse events were systematically measured or spontaneously reported. Only one of 72 trials that were retained objectively measured changes in cognitive performance (Mini-Mental State Examination). Dizziness was the most frequently reported side effect, in 3% of oxybutynin, 3.2% of propiverine, and 1.8% of tolterodine users, compared with 1.6% with placebo. Confusion was reported in fewer than 1% of cases. Age-stratified analyses of CNS outcomes from trials in adults aged 65 and older with overactive bladder were found in only eight publications. Meta-analyses were conducted with 33 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to determine the effect of each drug and dose on different CNS outcomes. Study heterogeneity, dosing inconsistency, and reporting bias limited interpretation of the findings from the meta-analyses. More-detailed standardized measurement of age-stratified CNS outcomes in clinical trials is required to better inform patients and clinicians about CNS risks associated with antimuscarinic agents.

441,excluded,"The clear study: a 5-day, 3-g loading dose of mycophenolate mofetil versus standard 2-g dosing in renal transplantation","Background and objectives: Adequate early mycophenolic acid (MPA) exposure is associated with lower rates of acute rejection in renal transplantation. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to determine if higher initial mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) doses increased the proportion of patients reaching therapeutic MPA levels (30 to 60 mg.h/L) by day 5. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: De novo renal transplant patients were randomized to receive intensified dosing of MMF (1.5 g twice daily on days 1 to 5, then 1.0 g twice daily) or standard dosing (1.0 g twice daily). All recipients received tacrolimus and prednisone. Full MPA areas under the curve (AUCs) were completed on days 3 and 5, whereas a limited sampling strategy was utilized at four subsequent time points. Results: At day 5, 47.5% of the MMF 3-g arm achieved the MPA therapeutic window versus 54.4% of the MMF 2-g arm. However, MPA AUC levels were significantly higher in the 3-g arm at day 3 and 5. This resulted in a trend for fewer treated acute rejections at 6 months. Significantly more acute rejections (treated, biopsy-proven including and excluding borderline) occurred in patients with MPA AUC levels <30 mg.h/L compared with those >= 30 mg.h/L at day 5. No significant differences were seen in common adverse events. Conclusions: A limited intensified dose of MMF increased early MPA exposure and was well tolerated. Further studies are required to determine whether limited intensified MMF dosing can reduce acute rejection. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 5: 1282-4289, 2010. doi: 10.2215/CJN.09091209",
442,excluded,Mechanisms of real and apparent priming effects and their dependence on soil microbial biomass and community structure: critical review,"The number of studies on priming effects (PE) in soil has strongly increased during the last years. The information regarding real versus apparent PE as well as their mechanisms remains controversial. Based on a meta-analysis of studies published since 1980, we evaluated the intensity, direction, and the reality of PE in dependence on the amount and quality of added primers, the microbial biomass and community structure, enzyme activities, soil pH, and aggregate size. The meta-analysis allowed revealing quantitative relationships between the amounts of added substrates as related to microbial biomass C and induced PE. Additions of easily available organic C up to 15% of microbial biomass C induce a linear increase of extra CO2. When the added amount of easily available organic C is higher than 50% of the microbial biomass C, an exponential decrease of the PE or even a switch to negative values is often observed. A new approach based on the assessment of changes in the production of extracellular enzymes is suggested to distinguish real and apparent PE. To distinguish real and apparent PE, we discuss approaches based on the C budget. The importance of fungi for long-term changes of SOM decomposition is underlined. Priming effects can be linked with microbial community structure only considering changes in functional diversity. We conclude that the PE involves not only one mechanism but a succession of processes partly connected with succession of microbial community and functions. An overview of the dynamics and intensity of these processes as related to microbial biomass changes and C and N availability is presented.",
443,excluded,Effects of biochar on carbon and nitrogen fluxes in boreal forest soil,"Background and aims The addition of biochar to soil may offer a chance to mitigate climate change by increasing soil carbon stocks, improving soil fertility and enhancing plant growth. The impacts of biochar in cold environments with limited microbial activity are still poorly known. Methods In order to understand to what extent different types and application rates of biochar affect carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes in boreal forests, we conducted a field experiment where two different spruce biochars (pyrolysis temperatures 500 A degrees C and 650 A degrees C) were applied at the rate of 0, 5 and 10 t ha(-1) to Pinus sylvestris forests in Finland. Results During the second summer after treatment, soil CO2 effluxes showed no clear response to biochar addition. Only in June, the 10 t ha(-1) biochar (650 A degrees C) plots had significantly higher CO2 effluxes compared to the control plots. The pyrolysis temperature of biochar did not affect soil CO2 effluxes. Soil pH increased in the plots receiving 10 t ha(-1) biochar additions. Biochar treatments had no significant effect on soil microbial biomass and biological N fixation. Nitrogen mineralization rates in the organic layer tended to increase with the amount of biochar, but no statistically significant effect was detected. Conclusions The results suggest that wood biochar amendment rates of 5-10 t ha(-1) to boreal forest soil do not cause large or long-term changes in soil CO2 effluxes or reduction in native soil C stocks. Furthermore, the results imply that biochar does not adversely affect soil microbial biomass or key N cycling processes in boreal xeric forests, at least within this time frame. Thus, it seems that biochar is a promising tool to mitigate climate change and sequester additional C in boreal forest soils.",Biochar; Biological nitrogen fixation; Microbial biomass; Nitrogen mineralization; Nitrification; Soil respiration

Conservation tillage can be adopted in these soils for soil protection and quality enhancement, but its assessment can be troublesome. Crop yields and the implications of rock fragments for soil quality indicators and for calculating C and N stocks were monitored under conventional and notillage in an experimental field recently converted to irrigation, on a soil with 40% rock fragments. Gains of up to 10 Mg C ha(-1) were observed in the tilled layer (0-30 cm) only with two years of irrigation, with no differences between treatments, although the vertical distribution of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) was affected by the correction of the rock fragment content. The labile organic fraction stood as a sensitive indicator to management changes, even after rock fragment correction. Different methodologies used for rock fragment correction led to overestimations of 20% of organic C stocks.",Carbon sequestration; rock fragments; soil organic carbon
446,excluded,Biochar effects on rice paddy: meta-analysis,"Rice is staple for nearly half of the world population. Biochar (BC) improves crop yields, reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and immobilizes heavy metals in the soil. This study was aimed to meta-analyze the data from the published articles focused on the various BCs' effects on rice yield, soil acidity, GHG emissions, and bioavailability of Cd and Pb. The data of pyrolysis temperature, application rate, and feedstock of BCs were categorized by using the MetaWin software for calculating the mean effect sizes (E) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Compared to the control, the BCs increased soil pH and rice yield by 11.8%(medium E+: 0.436 to 0.439) and 16%(large E+: 0.790 to 0.883), respectively. Applying BCs derived from different feedstocks and pyrolysis temperatures reduced N2O emissions from rice paddies (large E -:- 0.692 to -0.863). The BCs produced at 550-600 degrees C reduced the GHG emission with medium to large negative effects (E -:- 1.571 to -0.413). Applications of BCs at a range of 41-50 t ha(-1) were the best for rice productivity. Applications of all types and rates of BCs showed the significant decrease of available Cd by 35.4%-38.0% in a soil and led to the Cd reduction by an average of 43.6% in rice grains compared to the untreated soils. Applying BC is a promising approach to meet the challenges of sustainable global rice production, and the properties of BCs should be fully characterized and designed depending on its needs prior to its application.",

MeasurementsWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for peer-reviewed reports of individuals undergoing heart valve surgery who underwent pre- and postoperative cognitive assessment. Our initial search returned 1,475 articles, of which 12 were included. Postoperative cognitive results were divided into those from 1 week to 1 month (early outcomes, n(pooled)=450) and from 2 to 6 months (intermediate outcomes; n(pooled)=722). No studies with longer-term outcomes were identified. ResultsSubjects had moderate early cognitive decline from baseline (Becker mean gain effect size (ES)=-0.390.27) that improved slightly by 2 to 6 months (ES=-0.25 +/- 0.38). Individuals undergoing aortic valve surgerywho were older on average than those undergoing mitral valve surgery (68 vs 57)had greater early cognitive decline than those undergoing mitral valve surgery (ES=-0.68 vs -0.12), but both cohorts had similar decline 2 to 6 months postoperatively (ES=-0.27 vs -0.20). ConclusionsHeart valve surgery is associated with cognitive decline over the 6 months after surgery, but outcomes beyond 6 months are unclear.

Here, for the first time, we performed a meta-analysis and found that the GGP largely increased the soil organic carbon (SOC). The SOC was increased by 48.1%, 25.4%, and 25.5% at soil depths of 0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, and 40-60 cm, respectively. Moreover, this carbon accumulation has significantly increased over time since GGP implementation. The carbon accumulation showed a significantly more active response to the GGP in the top 20 cm of soil than in the deeper soil layers. Conversion of cropland to forest could lead to significantly greater SOC accumulation than would the conversion of cropland to grassland. Conversion from cropland to woodland could lead to greater SOC accumulation than would the conversion to either shrubland or orchard. Our results suggest that the GGP implementation caused SOC to accumulate and that there remains a large potential for further accumulation of carbon in the soil, which will help to mitigate climate change in the near future.",Carbon/*chemistry; China; Ecosystem; *Edible Grain; Geography; Organic Agriculture; Soil/*chemistry

As a uniform definition of sOM NSCLC is lacking, we developed a definition and diagnostic criteria by a consensus process. Methods: A pan-European multidisciplinary consensus group was established. Consensus questions were built on the basis of current controversies, and definitions were extracted from a survey, cases and a systematic review. This statement was formulated during a consensus meeting. Results: It was determined that definition of sOM NSCLC is relevant when a radical treatment that may modify the disease course (leading to long-term disease control) is technically feasible for all tumor sites with acceptable toxicity. On the basis of the review, a maximum of five metastases and three organs was proposed. Mediastinal lymph node involvement was not counted as a metastatic site. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography-computed tomography and brain imaging were considered mandatory. A dedicated liver magnetic resonance imaging scan was advised for a solitary liver metastasis, and thoracoscopy and biopsies of distant ipsilateral pleural sites were recommended for a solitary pleural metastasis. For mediastinal staging, fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography-computed tomography was deemed the minimum requirement, with pathological confirmation recommended if this influences the treatment strategy. Biopsy of a solitary metastatic location was mandated unless the multidisciplinary team is of the opinion that the risks outweigh the benefits. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary consensus statement on the definition and staging of sOM NSCLC has been formulated. This statement will help to standardize inclusion criteria in future clinical trials. (C) 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. Published by Elsevier Inc.

450,excluded,"Negative emissions-Part 2: Costs, potentials and side effects","The most recent IPCC assessment has shown an important role for negative emissions technologies (NETs) in limiting global warming to 2 degrees C cost-effectively. However, a bottom-up, systematic, reproducible, and transparent literature assessment of the different options to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is currently missing. In part 1 of this three-part review on NETs, we assemble a comprehensive set of the relevant literature so far published, focusing on seven technologies: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering, ocean fertilisation, biochar, and soil carbon sequestration. In this part, part 2 of the review, we present estimates of costs, potentials, and side-effects for these technologies, and qualify them with the authors' assessment. Part 3 reviews the innovation and scaling challenges that must be addressed to realise NETs deployment as a viable climate mitigation strategy. Based on a systematic review of the literature, our best estimates for sustainable global NET potentials in 2050 are 0.5-3.6 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for afforestation and reforestation, 0.5-5GtCO(2) yr(-1) for BECCS, 0.5-2GtCO(2) yr(-1) for biochar, 2-4 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for enhanced weathering, 0.5-5 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for DACCS, and up to 5GtCO(2) yr(-1) for soil carbon sequestration. Costs vary widely across the technologies, as do their permanency and cumulative potentials beyond 2050.

451,excluded,Simulation of accumulation and mineralization (co2 release) of organic carbon in chernozem under different straw return ways after corn harvesting,"Straw return is the main way of fertility improvement of cultivated chernozem in Songnen Plain of Northeast China. To reveal the effect of ""corn straw return mixed with soil or ploughing"" (""straw mixing"" for short) and ""corn straw return to the surface of soil"" (""straw mulching"" for short) on fertility and environment of soil, we focused on the effects of different straw applications on the release of CO2 and accumulation of soil organic carbon. A laboratory simulative incubation experiment was conducted with chernozem, and corn stalk. Under the constant condition of 28 degrees C, all curves of the emission rate of CO2 had appeared a peak of the emission of CO2 on the 4th or 6th day of the culture, and then stepped into the first slow emission platform on the 13th-52nd day and stepped into the second slow emission platform on the 52nd-91st day. With the same amount of straw, the peak value of CO2 emission rate of ""straw mixing"" (23.00, 43.64, 79.70 mg kg(-1) d(-1) for straw 2%, 4%, and 6%, respectively) was apparently greater than that of ""straw mulching"" (22.94, 39.76, 58.71 mg kg(-1) d(-1) for straw 2%, 4%, and 6%, respectively). However, after entering the slow emission platform, the average emission rate of CO2 of ""straw mixing"" would be less than that of ""straw mulching"". There was an apparent intersection point (about 31 d for straw 2%, 4% and 47 d for straw 6%) on the curves of both the CO2 emission rate of ""straw mixing"" and ""straw mulching"". Before the intersection point, the accumulated amount of CO2-C emission of ""straw mixing"" was greater than that of ""straw mulching"" and then lower than that of ""straw mulching"" gradually after the point. The analysis of the result about the soil organic carbon and the composition of micro-aggregate showed that with the same amount of straw addition, ""straw mixing"" could increase soil organic content and improve the composition of micro-aggregate better than ""straw mulching"". The results indicated that it might have a better effect on fertility and environment of soil than the return of straw for surface of soil if the means of ploughing in autumn and rotary tillage, etc. could be used in the process of the returning of straw mixed with soil or cultivation.

Here, we focused on the potential of mixed-species plantings, for which there is negligible information but expanding investment due to their added environmental benefits. We surveyed soil C and N over a representative chronosequence (5-29 years old) of existing plantings, including measurements in the adjacent pastures to account for differences in soil type and land-use history among properties. Vegetation characteristics of the tree plantings were measured to identify potential surrogates for rapid assessment of soil C. Soil C was highly heterogeneous under the plantings and the adjacent pastures, with up to eight cores required to sample adequately a plot of 400 m(2). Vegetation surrogates had limited success in predicting soil C after afforestation, with the only strong predictors being tree density and planting age. Three decades of afforestation with mixed species had not led to substantial changes in C concentration or content of the soil. The C:N ratio of soils increased with planting age suggesting that the C becomes more resistant to decomposition after afforestation. Over longer time scales, tree plantings are likely to have larger impacts on the amount and forms of soil C. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

454,excluded,Cultivar mixtures: a meta-analysis of the effect of intraspecific diversity on crop yield,"Extensive research has shown that greater plant community diversity leads to higher levels of productivity and other ecosystem services, and such increased diversity has been suggested as a way to improve yield and agricultural sustainability. Increasing intraspecific diversity with cultivar mixtures is one way to increase diversity in agricultural systems. We examined the relationship between intraspecific diversity and yield in cultivar mixtures using a meta-analysis of 91 studies and >3,600 observations. Additionally, we investigated how environmental and management factors might influence this relationship, and if the yield stability of cultivar mixtures differed from that of monocultures. We found that the yield increased by 2.2% overall in cultivar mixtures relative to their monoculture components. Mixtures with more cultivars and those with more functional trait diversity showed higher relative yields. Under biotic stressors, such as disease pressure, and abiotic stressors, such as low levels of soil organic matter and nutrient availability, this diversity effect was stronger, resulting in higher relative yields. Finally, cultivar mixtures generally showed higher yield stability compared to monocultures, especially in response to annual weather variability at a site over time. This practice of mixing cultivars can be integrated into intensified cropping systems where species monocultures dominate, as well as in smallholder cropping systems where low-cost improvements are in demand. Overall, these results suggest that cultivar mixtures are a viable strategy to increase diversity in agroecosystems, promoting increased yield and yield stability, with minimal environmental impact.",agroecosystems; biodiversity-ecosystem function; ecological intensification; environmental stress; food crops; small grains; stability; yield

Although novel oral anti-coagulants (NOACs) have been compared with SOC in this indication, no head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have directly compared NOACs. A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) were conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of NOACs for the initial and long-term treatment of VTE. Methods Electronic databases (accessed July 2014) were systematically searched to identify RCTs evaluating apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban versus SOC. Eligible patients included adults with an objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) or both. A fixed-effect Bayesian NMA was conducted for outcomes of interest, and results were presented as relative risks (RR) and 95% credible intervals (Crl). Results Six Phase III RCTs met criteria for inclusion: apixaban (one RCT; n = 5,395); rivaroxaban (two RCTs; n = 3,423/4,832); dabigatran (two RCTs; n = 2,539/2,568); edoxaban (one RCT; n = 8,240). There were no statistically significant differences between the NOACs with regard to the risk of 'VTE and VTE-related death. Apixaban treatment was associated with the most favourable safety profile of the NOACs, showing a statistically significantly reduced risk of 'major or clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleed' compared with rivaroxaban (0.47 [0.36, 0.61]), dabigatran (0.69 [0.51, 0.94]), and edoxaban (0.54 [0.41, 0.69]). Dabigatran was also associated with a significantly lower risk of 'major or CRNM bleed' compared with rivaroxaban (0.68 [0.53, 0.87]) and edoxaban (0.77 [0.60, 0.99]). Conclusions Indirect comparisons showed statistically similar reductions in the risk of 'VTE or VTE-related death for all NOACs. In contrast, reductions in 'major or CRNM bleed' for initial/longterm treatment were significantly better with apixaban compared with all other NOACs, and with dabigatran compared with rivaroxaban and edoxaban.

Common adverse events included constipation (median frequency of occurrence 30%), nausea (28%), and dizziness (22%) and prompted opioid discontinuation in 25% of cases. Abuse and misuse behaviors were negatively associated with older age. In older adults with chronic pain and no significant comorbidity, short-term use of opioids is associated with reduction in pain intensity and better physical functioning but poorer mental health functioning. The long-term safety, efficacy, and abuse potential of this treatment practice in diverse populations of older persons remain to be determined. J Am Geriatr Soc 58: 1353-1369, 2010.",
457,excluded,"Effect of vitamin d supplementation on muscle strength, gait and balance in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis","OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and quantitatively synthesize the effect of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength, gait, and balance in older adults. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, bibliographies of selected articles, and previous systematic reviews were searched between January 1980 and November 2010 for eligible articles. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults (-60) participating in randomized controlled trials of the effect of supplemental vitamin D without an exercise intervention on muscle strength, gait, and balance. MEASUREMENTS: Data were independently extracted, and study quality was evaluated. Meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model was performed and the I 2 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity. RESULTS: Of 714 potentially relevant articles, 13 met the inclusion criteria. In the pooled analysis, vitamin D supplementation yielded a standardized mean difference of -0.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.39 to -0.01, P =.04, I 2 = 0%) for reduced postural sway, -0.19 (95% CI = -0.35 to -0.02, P =.03, I 2 = 0%) for decreased time to complete the Timed Up and Go Test, and 0.05 (95% CI = -0.11 to 0.20, P =.04, I 2 = 0%) for lower extremity strength gain. Regarding dosing frequency regimen, only one study demonstrated a beneficial effect on balance with a single large dose. All studies with daily doses of 800 IU or more demonstrated beneficial effects on balance and muscle strength. CONCLUSION: Supplemental vitamin D with daily doses of 800 to 1,000 IU consistently demonstrated beneficial effects on strength and balance. An effect on gait was not demonstrated, although further evaluation is recommended. J Am Geriatr Soc 59: 2291-2300, 2011.",

As a result, various land restoration and conservation efforts are underway at different scales. Ethiopia is one of the countries with huge investments in land restoration. Tremendous land management practices have been implemented across the country since the 1970s. However, the spatial distribution of the interventions has not been documented, and there is no systematic, quantitative evidence on whether land restoration efforts have achieved the restoration of desired ecosystem services. Therefore, we carried out a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed scientific literature related to land restoration efforts and their impacts in Ethiopia. Results show that most of the large-scale projects have been implemented in the highlands, specifically in Tigray and Amhara regions covering about 24 agroecological zones, and land restoration impact studies are mostly focused in the highlands but restricted in about 11 agroecological zones. The highest mean effect on agricultural productivity is obtained from the combination of bunds and biological interventions followed by conservation agriculture practices with 170% and 18% increases, respectively. However, bunds alone, biological intervention alone, and terracing (fanya juu) reveal negative effects on productivity. The mean effect of all land restoration interventions on soil organic carbon is positive, the highest effect being from ""bunds + biological"" (139%) followed by exclosure (90%). Reduced soil erosion and runoff are the dominant impacts of all interventions. The results can be used to improve existing guidelines to better match land restoration options with specific desired ecosystem functions and services. Although the focus of this study was on the evaluation of the impacts of land restoration efforts on selected ecosystem services, impacts on livelihood and national socioeconomy have not been examined. Thus, strengthening socioeconomic studies at national scale to assess the sustainability of land restoration initiatives is an essential next step.",ecosystem services; effect size; land degradation; landscape restoration; meta-analysis
459,excluded,Temperature influences carbon accumulation in moist tropical forests,"Evergreen broad-leaved tropical forests can have high rates of productivity and large accumulations of carbon in plant biomass and soils. They can therefore play an important role in the global carbon cycle, influencing atmospheric CO2 concentrations if climate warms. We applied meta-analyses to published data to evaluate the apparent effects of temperature on carbon fluxes and storages in mature, moist tropical evergreen forest ecosystems. Among forests, litter production, tree growth, and belowground carbon allocation all increased significantly with site mean annual temperature (MAT); total net primary productivity (NPP) increased by an estimated 0.2-0.7 Mg C(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1.)degrees C-1. Temperature had no discernible effect on the turnover rate of aboveground forest biomass, which averaged 0.014 yr(-1) among sites. Consistent with these findings, forest biomass increased with site MAT at a rate of 5-13 Mg C(.)ha(-1.)degrees C-1. Despite greater productivity in warmer forests, soil organic matter accumulations decreased with site MAT, with a slope of -8 Mg C(.)ha(-1.)degrees C-1, indicating that decomposition rates of soil organic matter increased with MAT faster than did rates of NPP. Turnover rates of surface litter also increased with temperature among forests. We found no detectable effect of temperature on total carbon storage among moist tropical evergreen forests, but rather a shift in ecosystem structure, from low-biomass forests with relatively large accumulations of detritus in cooler sites, to large-biomass forests with relatively smaller detrital stocks in warmer locations. These results imply that, in a warmer climate, conservation of forest biomass will be critical to the maintenance of carbon stocks in moist tropical forests.",
460,included,Quantifying effects of different agricultural land uses on soil microbial biomass and activity in Brazilian biomes: inferences to improve soil quality,"Maintenance of soil quality is a key component of agriculture sustainability and a main goal of most farmers, environmentalists and government policymakers. However, as there are no parameters or methods to evaluate soil quality directly, some attributes of relevant soil functions are taken as indicators; lately, an increase in the use of soil microbial parameters has occurred, and their viability as indicators of proper land use has been highlighted. In this study we performed a meta-analysis of the response ratios of several microbial and chemical parameters to soil disturbance by different land uses in the Brazilian biomes. The studies included native forests, pastures and perennial and annual cropping systems. The introduction of agricultural practices in all biomes covered previously with natural vegetation profoundly affected microbial biomass-C (MB-C)aEuro center dot with an overall decrease of 31%. Annual crops most severely reduced microbial biomass and soil organic C, with an average decrease of 53% in the MB-C. In addition, the MB-C/TSOC (total soil organic carbon) ratio was significantly decreased with the transformation of forests to perennial plantation (25%), pastures (26%), and annual cropping (20%). However, each biome reacted differently to soil disturbance, i.e., decreases in MB-C followed the order of Cerrado > Amazon > Caatinga > Atlantic Forest. In addition, the Cerrado appeared to have the most fragile soil ecosystem because of lower MB-C/TSOC and higher qCO(2). Unfortunately, the Cerrado and the Amazon, demonstrated by our study as the most fragile biomes, have been subjected to the highest agronomic pressure. The results reported here may help to infer the best land-use strategies to improve soil quality and achieve agriculture sustainability. The approach can also be very useful to monitor soil quality in other tropical and subtropical biomes.",Brazilian biomes; Deforestation; Meta-analyses; Land use change; Soil; organic matter

Despite its importance, little is known about the magnitude and consistency of changes in SOC stocks (Mg ha(-1))due to management of highly weathered soils in Brazil. Prom 37 uncultivated/cultivated paired sites in Brazil (most on Oxisols). SOC stocks were calculated for the depths of 0-20 and 040 cm. Changes in SOC stocks were calculated for intensive (with annual tillage) and non-intensive (pastures. conservation tillage and perennial crops) land use systems. Intensive systems caused significant (t-test. P < 0.05) SOC loss of 10.3% or 6.74 Mg ha(-1) in the 0-20 cm depth, but not in the 0-40 cm depth. In general, non-intensive systems had no significant effect on SOC stocks in the 0-20 and 0-40 cm depths. However, in coarse-textured soils (<= 200 g clay kg(-1)), non-intensive systems caused significant SOC losses of about 20% for both 0-20 and 0-40 cm depths (8.5 and 15.5 Mg SOC ha(-1), respectively). No significant changes in SOC were detected in Oxisols (>= 500 g clay kg(-1)) and clayey Oxisols (>= 500 g clay kg(-1)), in five arbitrary ecoregions or under the three different non-intensive land use systems. Average SOC losses under intensive and non-intensive systems were low in comparison to those reported for temperate ecosystems. probably due to: (a) lower SOC stocks in surface when compared to temperate soils, and (b) strong interaction of Al/Fe oxides in clay with SOC.

The aims of this study were to assess the response of soil organic C (SOC), total N (TN), labile C and N - including microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), inorganic N (N-inorg), dissolved organic C (DOC), and N (DON) - to 15-year experimental warming in an alpine region (Kobresia meadow and Potentilla scrubland), on the northeastern QTP using open-top chambers (OTCs). Fifteen-year experimental warming had no effect on SOC and TN concentrations and storage at 0-30 cm soil depth, either in Kobresia meadow or Potentilla scrubland habitat, which might be related to the low temperature increase and the unchanged water content. Long-term warming obviously affected soil labile C and N and their contributions to SOC and TN, especially in the meadow habitat, but the values were low, thus the variation of the labile C and N was not enough to influence total C and N storage. The C and N pools were shown to be controlled by different controlling factors, and scrubland was more stable than the meadow ecosystem confronting the change of environment.",
463,excluded,Assessment of somatization and medically unexplained symptoms in later life,"The assessment of medically unexplained symptoms and somatic symptom disorders in older adults is challenging due to somatic multimorbidity, which threatens the validity of somatization questionnaires. In a systematic review study, the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) and the somatization subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90-item version (SCL-90 SOM) are recommended out of 40 questionnaires for usage in large-scale studies. While both scales measure physical symptoms which in younger persons often refer to unexplained symptoms, in older persons, these symptoms may originate from somatic diseases. Using empirical data, we show that PHQ-15 and SCL-90 SOM among older patients correlate with proxies of somatization as with somatic disease burden. Updating the previous systematic review, revealed six additional questionnaires. Cross-validation studies are needed as none of 46 identified scales met the criteria of suitability for an older population. Nonetheless, specific recommendations can be made for studying older persons, namely the SCL-90 SOM and PHQ-15 for population-based studies, the Freiburg Complaint List and somatization subscale of the Brief Symptom Inventory 53-item version for studies in primary care, and finally the Schedule for Evaluating Persistent Symptoms and Somatic Symptom Experiences Questionnaire for monitoring treatment studies.",medically unexplained symptoms; MUS; somatic symptoms; somatic symptom disorders; somatoform disorders; aged; aged 80 years and older; instruments
464,included,"A global analysis of the impact of zero-tillage on soil physical condition, organic carbon content, and plant root response","Food security involves the sustainable utilization of soil and land resources. Zero-tillage (ZT) practice is a proponent of better resource utilization, to improve soil physical condition, and a potential sink to atmospheric carbon. However, the impact varies across climates, over the ZT history, cropping systems, and soil depths. A meta-analysis was performed, based on 4,131 paired data from 522 studies spread globally, to evaluate the effect of ZT in comparison to conventional tillage, on soil physical condition (bulk density; mean weight diameter of aggregates; field capacity water content; and steady-state infiltration rate), soil organic carbon (SOC) content, and the root response (root length density). Zero-tillage significantly improved mean weight diameter of aggregates and field capacity water content at surface and subsurface layers by 19-58% and 6-16%, respectively, and resulted in no change in bulk density in either of the layers, but infiltration rate increased by 66%. Surface 0- to 5- and 5- to 10-cm layers had significantly higher SOC content under ZT, whereas in other layers, the SOC content either reduced or did not change, resulting in a small and insignificant variation in the SOC stock (1.1%) in favor of ZT. The root length density improved by 35% in ZT only at 0- to 5-cm soil depth. Effect of climate, soil type, or cropping system could not be broadly recognized, but the impact of ZT certainly increased over time. Improvements in soil aggregation and hydraulic properties are highly convincing with the adoption of ZT, and therefore, this practice leads to the better and sustainable use of soil resources.",meta-analysis; zero-tillage; plant root; soil physical condition; soil organic carbon
465,excluded,Evidence that calcium supplements reduce fracture risk is lacking,"Credible evidence that calcium supplements reduce the risk of vertebral, nonvertebral, or hip fractures is lacking. Flaws in study design and execution such as inclusion of calcium-replete individuals, high dropout rates, and poor compliance preclude testing the hypothesis that calcium deficiency increases fracture rates or that calcium supplements reduce them. Intent-to-treat analyses of individual trials have failed to detect antifracture efficacy. Post hoc analyses of subgroups with a low calcium intake and per-protocol analyses of compliers have reported fewer fractures in the supplemented groups. However, this may be the result of confounding by violation of randomization; compliers to placebo have a lower morbidity and mortality than noncompliers. Higher hip fracture rates and cardiac mortality in patients receiving calcium supplements, as reported in some studies, may also be due to factors other than supplementation. Hypothesis testing requires that a cohort be stratified into calcium-deficient and calcium-replete groups, with each person randomized to a supplement or placebo. This design quantifies the risk of fracture attributable to calcium deficiency and any benefit that supplementation confers in the calcium-deficient and calcium-replete groups. To regard a calcium-deficient arm as unethical begs the question. Consensus statements that support the widespread use of calcium are opinion-based; they accept claims of beneficial effects despite flaws in study design, execution, and analysis; and they reject reported adverse effects because of them. Until well designed, well executed, and well analyzed studies demonstrate a net benefit in morbidity, mortality, and cost, recommendations supporting the widespread use of calcium supplementation remain belief-based and not evidence-based.

466,excluded,Anthropogenic n deposition increases soil c storage by decreasing the extent of litter decay: analysis of field observations with an ecosystem model,"Recent meta-analyses of experimental studies simulating increased anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition in forests reveal greater soil carbon (C) storage under elevated levels of atmospheric N deposition. However, these effects have not yet been included in ecosystem-scale models of soil C and N cycling and it is unclear whether increased soil C storage results from slower decomposition rates or a reduced extent of decomposition (for example, an increase in the amount of litter entering slowly decaying humus pools). To test these alternatives, we conducted a meta-analysis of litter decomposition data. We then used the results from our meta-analysis to model C and N cycling in four sugar maple forests in Michigan using an ecosystem process model (TRACE). We compared model results testing our alternative hypotheses to field data on soil C storage from a 17-year N deposition experiment. Using data from published litter decomposition studies in forests, we determined that, on average, exogenous N inputs decreased lignin decomposition rates by 30% and increased cellulose decomposition by 9%. In the same set of litter decomposition studies increased exogenous N availability increased the amount of litter entering slowly decaying humus pools in a manner significantly related to the lignocellulose index of decaying litter. Incorporating changes to decomposition rates in TRACE did not accurately reproduce greater soil C storage observed in our field study with experimentally elevated N deposition. However, when changes in the extent of decomposition were incorporated in TRACE, the model produced increased soil C storage by increasing the amount of litter entering the humus pool and accurately represented C storage in plant and soil pools under experimental N deposition. Our modeling results and meta-analysis indicate that the extent of litter decay as humus is formed, rather than slower rates of litter decay, is likely responsible for the accumulation of organic matter, and hence soil C storage, under experimental N deposition. This effect should be incorporated in regional to global-scale models simulating the C balance of forest ecosystems in regions receiving elevated N deposition.",
467,excluded,Parental factors influencing the development of early childhood caries in developing nations: a systematic review,"Background: Early childhood caries (ECC) is one of the most prevalent and chronic conditions of childhood. Various factors including biological and dietary factors along with an overlay of parental social factors have been found to be associated with the progression of ECC. The objective of this systematic review is to synthesize available literature and to identify parent-level proximal and distal risk factors associated with the development of ECC in developing nations. Methods: Studies conducted in developing nations, published between 2005 and 2017 in English, that included children younger than 6 years and examined ECC were included. The outcome of interest were parental risk factors, which included parental knowledge, behavior, attitudes, sense of coherence (SOC), stress, socioeconomic status (SES), education, and breastfeeding duration. The studies were retrieved from MEDLINE, Ovid Medline, and PubMed. Results: The search yielded 325 studies, of which 18 were considered eligible for inclusion in this review. Ten studies found maternal education, and seven studies found parental education to be significantly associated with ECC. SES was significantly associated with ECC in 13 studies in the form of annual household income and occupation level. Four studies observed the significant association between oral health knowledge and attitudes with ECC, whereas only two studies found maternal attitude to be associated with ECC. Breastfeeding duration was a significant risk factor in four studies. One study each found significant associations of SOC, parental distress, and secondary smoke with ECC. Conclusion: To date, most of the researches done in developing countries have reported distal parental factors such as income and education being significant risk factors in caries development compared to proximal risk factors in low-income groups. Only a few studies analyzed the psychosocial and behavioral factors. Interventions could be designed to improve parental oral health knowledge and behaviors in these nations.",dental caries; parents; child; risk factors; health knowledge attitudes practice; sociological factors

As a promising procedure, the efficacy and safety of ADM remains controversial. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the efficacy and safety of acellular dermal matrix to standard of care in DFU. Methods: Databases, including Pubmed, Medline, Embase and Cochrane library were searched to identify RCTs comparing ADM to SOC in DFU patients. The outcomes mainly included complete wound healing, mean time to heal and adverse events. Results: A total of 632 DFU patients from 6 RCTs were subjected to meta-analysis. The results showed that compared with the merely SOC, the complete healing rate in ADM group was higher both at 12 weeks [risk ratio (RR) 2.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 3.76] and 16 weeks [RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.93]. The mean time to complete wound healing was shorter in ADM group [MD = -2.98, 95% CI: -5.15 to -0.82]. The occurrence of adverse event in both groups showed no significant difference [RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.67]. Conclusion: Compared with standard of care, acellular dermal matrix may accelerate the healing velocity of uninfected, non-ischemic, full-thickness diabetic foot ulcer. Acellular dermal matrix showed superiority compared with standard of care alone, while generating no more complications. (C) 2017 IJS Publishing Group Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

469,excluded,Heterogeneity in decomposition rates and annual litter inputs within fine-root architecture of tree species: implications for forest soil carbon accumulation,"Fine roots (<= 2 mm in diameter) of tree species, traditionally regarded as homogenous entities, are expected to be major contributors of forest soil organic carbon (C), but their contributions need to be reevaluated given the heterogeneity in many root characteristics within fine-root architecture. Here, literature data were synthesized to analyze whether there existed heterogeneity of decomposition rates within fine-root architecture of tree species and quantify the relative contributions of roots of each branching order to forest soil C storage by combining variations in annual litter inputs among fine-root branching hierarchies. Results showed the presence of heterogeneity in decomposition rates within fine-root architecture, and this pattern was influenced by classification methods (root order or diameter class). Specifically, the heterogeneity in decomposition rates was shown only when fine roots were classified by root order, but not when fine roots were classified by diameter class. The slower decomposition rates of lower-order roots (the first two orders) were related to their higher acid-unhydrolyzable residues. Furthermore, lower-order roots were found to account for 57-71% of annual root litter inputs of the first five orders. Given the slow decomposition rates and high annual litter inputs of lower-order roots of tree species, our findings suggest that lower-order roots should be important contributors to forest soil organic C.

We conducted a systematic review to determine the: (1) prevalence of opioid and benzodiazepine use among dialysis patients; (2) reasons for use; (3) effectiveness of symptom control; and (4) incidence of adverse events. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Two authors reviewed all relevant citations in MEDLINE/EMBASE/CINAHL/BIOSIS Previews/Cochrane and hand-searched bibliographies. Studies after 1990 reporting prevalence estimates for opioid and/or benzodiazepine use in dialysis patients were included. Results We identified 15 studies from 12 countries over 1995 to 2006. Sample size ranged from 75 to 12,782. Prevalence of opioid and benzodiazepine use was variable, ranging from 5 to 36% (95% CI, 4.1 to 45.5%; n = 10) and 8 to 26% (95% CI, 7.1 to 27.3%; n = 9), respectively. Prevalence was positively correlated with years on dialysis. Five studies reported on the same cohorts but gave different prevalence estimates. One study verified medication use through patient interviews. Reasons for use were reported in one study. Effectiveness of pain control varied from 17 to 38%, and 72 to 84% of patients with significant pain had no analgesia (n = 2). No study rigorously examined for adverse events. Conclusions The prevalence of opioid and benzodiazepine use in dialysis patients is highly variable between centers.

However, the overall trend and magnitude of changes in soil C in response to straw return remain uncertain. In this meta-analysis, we calculated the response ratios of soil organic C (SOC) concentrations, greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission, nutrient contents and other important soil properties to straw addition in 176 published field studies. Our results indicated that straw return significantly increased SOC concentration by 12.8 +/- 0.4% on average, with a 27.4 +/- 1.4% to 56.6 +/- 1.8% increase in soil active C fraction. CO2 emission increased in both upland (27.8 +/- 2.0%) and paddy systems (51.0 +/- 2.0%), while CH4 emission increased by 110.7 +/- 1.2% only in rice paddies. N2O emission has declined by 15.2 +/- 1.1% in paddy soils but increased by 8.3 +/- 2.5% in upland soils. Responses of macro-aggregates and crop yield to straw return showed positively linear with increasing SOC concentration. Straw-C input rate and clay content significantly affected the response of SOC. A significant positive relationship was found between annual SOC sequestered and duration, suggesting that soil C saturation would occur after 12years under straw return. Overall, straw return was an effective means to improve SOC accumulation, soil quality, and crop yield. Straw return-induced improvement of soil nutrient availability may favor crop growth, which can in turn increase ecosystem C input. Meanwhile, the analysis on net global warming potential (GWP) balance suggested that straw return increased C sink in upland soils but increased C source in paddy soils due to enhanced CH4 emission. Our meta-analysis suggested that future agro-ecosystem models and cropland management should differentiate the effects of straw return on ecosystem C budget in upland and paddy soils.",GHGs emission; soil organic carbon; straw return; carbon sequestration; meta-analysis

This meta-analysis was performed to determine whether angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce fatal and nonfatal CV events and left ventricular (LV) mass in patients receiving HD. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: Studies were identified by searching electronic databases, bibliographies, and conference proceedings. Two reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials using ACEIs or ARBs compared with control among patients receiving HD. Studies were independently assessed for inclusion, quality, and data extraction. Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled relative risk (RR) for CV outcomes and the weighted mean difference (WMD) for pooled change-from-baseline comparisons for LV mass for ACEI or ARB treated patients compared with control. Results: Compared with control, the RR of CV events associated with ACEI or ARB use was 0.66 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 1.25; P = 0.20]. ACEI or ARB use resulted in a statistically significant reduction in LV mass, with a WMD of 15.4 g/m(2) (95% CI 7.4 to 23.3; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Treatment with an ACEI or ARB reduced LV mass in patients receiving HD. However, their use was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of fatal and nonfatal CV events. Larger, high-quality trials in the HD population are required to determine if the effects of ACEI or ARB therapy on LV mass translate into decreased CV morbidity and mortality.

473,excluded,Precrop functional group identity affects yield of winter barley but less so high carbon amendments in a mesocosm experiment,"Nitrate leaching is a pressing environmental problem in intensive agriculture. Especially after the crop harvest, leaching risk is greatest due to decomposing plant residues, and low plant nutrient uptake and evapotranspiration. The specific crop also matters: grain legumes and canola commonly result in more leftover N than the following winter crop can take up before spring. Addition of a high carbon amendment (HCA) could potentially immobilize N after harvest. We set up a 2-year mesocosm experiment to test the effects of N fertilization (40 or 160 kg N/ha), HCA addition (no HCA, wheat straw, or sawdust), and precrop plant functional group identity on winter barley yield and soil C/N ratio. Four spring precrops were sown before winter barley (white lupine, faba bea n, spring canola, spring barley), which were selected based on a functional group approach (colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF] and/or N2-fixing bacteria). We also measured a subset of faba bean and spring barley for leaching over winter after harvest. As expected, N fertilization had the largest effect on winter barley yield, but precrop functional identity also significantly affected the outcome. The non-AMF precrops white lupine and canola had on average a positive effect on yield compared to the AMF precrops spring barley and faba bean under high N (23% increase). Under low N, we found only a small precrop effect. Sawdust significantly reduced the yield compared to the control or wheat straw under either N level. HCAs reduced nitrate leaching over winter, but only when faba bean was sown as a precrop. In our setup, short-term immobilization of N by HCA addition after harvest seems difficult to achieve. However, other effects such as an increase in SOM or nutrient retention could play a positive role in the long term. Contrary to the commonly found positive effect of AMF colonization, winter barley showed a greater yield when it followed a non-AMF precrop under high fertilization. This could be due to shifts of the agricultural AMF community toward parasitism.",crop rotation; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; rhizobia; barley; high carbon amendment; immobilization; plant functional group; nitrate leaching

DESIGN: Systematic literature review and meta-analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: People aged 60 and older living independently or in institutional settings. MEASUREMENTS: Studies were identified with searches of the PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL data bases. Retrospective and prospective cohort studies comparing times to complete any version of the TUG of fallers and non-fallers were included. RESULTS: Fifty-three studies with 12,832 participants met the inclusion criteria. The pooled mean difference between fallers and non-fallers depended on the functional status of the cohort investigated: 0.63 seconds (95% confidence (CI) = 0.14-1.12 seconds) for high-functioning to 3.59 seconds (95% CI = 2.18-4.99 seconds) for those in institutional settings. The majority of studies did not retain TUG scores in multivariate analysis. Derived cut-points varied greatly between studies, and with the exception of a few small studies, diagnostic accuracy was poor to moderate. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the TUG is not useful for discriminating fallers from non-fallers in healthy, high-functioning older people but is of more value in less-healthy, lower-functioning older people. Overall, the predictive ability and diagnostic accuracy of the TUG are at best moderate. No cut-point can be recommended.

Many studies have explored the factors that affect the direction and extent of changes in soil C after different harvest residue management practices. However, the effect of soil properties, especially soil texture, on the difference in mineral soil C storage between harvest residue retention and removal treatment are still not fully understood. Using a meta-analysis approach, we investigated the factors that influence the change in mineral soil C stocks following stem-only harvest (SOH), when compared to whole-tree harvest (WTH). We found that the retention of harvest residues associated with the SOH treatment led to 8.2% greater soil C storage in 0-20 cm mineral soils, compared to the WTH treatment. Soil properties (soil clay content and C concentrations) were the most important factors mediating soil C response to residue retention. Relative to the WTH treatment, the SOH treatment showed smaller mineral soil C pools in some high clay content soils, possibly by increasing the mineralization of existing soil organic matter stocks via a priming mechanism. Climate was a poor predictor of differences in treatment effects, with no significant difference between temperate and tropical forests. There were no significant relationships between the treatment effect on mineral soil C and mean annual temperature or precipitation. Both coniferous and broadleaf forests exhibited a significantly higher mineral soil C storage in the 0-20 cm soil layer with the SOH relative to the WTH treatment. Compared to WTH treatment, the higher soil C contents in upper mineral soils after the SOH treatment appeared to last about one decade after harvesting. The findings of this analysis suggest that soil texture and C concentrations in mineral soils should be considered when assessing the impact of forest harvest residue management on soil C pools.",Harvesting residues; Plantation; Priming effect; Soil carbon; Soil texture
476,excluded,Systematic review of lhrh agonists for the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer,"There is increasing use of luteinising hormone- releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer (J. Clin. Oncol. 19(2) (2001) 343). However, few mature studies are available and there is uncertainty regarding the optimal use of these agents. We performed a systematic review to address the rote of LHRH agonists in the adjuvant treatment of pre-menopausal women with early breast cancer. As ovarian suppression is unlikely to benefit women with ER-negative tumours, the review is limited to women with ER-positive disease. The objectives of this review were to address the following issues; the rote of LHRH agonists compared to tamoxifen (TAM), LHRH agonists in place of chemotherapy and LHRH agonists integrated into chemo-hormonal regimens. We identified 11 randomised trials. In three trials, adjuvant suppression of ovarian function using LHRH agonists, with or without TAM, had similar benefits at 5-6 years follow-up in terms of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) to adjuvant CMF chemotherapy (J. Clin. Oncol 20(24) (2002) 4628; J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 95(24) (2003) 1833; Anticancer Res. 22 (2002) 2325; In: San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, San Antonio, TX, 2003, Abstr 40). These findings suggest that ovarian suppression using LHRH agonists ( +/- TAM) is a reasonable alternative to CMF chemotherapy in women with oestrogen receptor (ER) positive tumours. The role of chemotherapy in addition to LHRH agonists is not clearly defined and mature results of four trials are awaited (J. Clin. Oncol.. 20(24) (2002) 4621; J. Clin.

477,included,A Global Meta-Analysis of Grazing Impacts on Soil Health Indicators,"Grazing lands support the livelihoods of millions of people across nearly one-half of the globe. Soils are the backbone of stability and resilience in these systems. To determine livestock grazing impacts on soil health, we conducted a global meta-analysis of soil organic carbon (SOC), total N, C/N ratio, and bulk density responses to grazing strategies (continuous, rotational, and no grazing) and intensities (heavy, moderate, and light grazing) from 64 studies around the world. Across all studies and grazing intensities, continuous grazing significantly reduced SOC, C/N, and total N compared with no grazing. Soil compaction (i.e., increased bulk density) was greater under both continuous and rotational grazing compared with no grazing; however, rotational grazing had lower bulk density than continuous grazing. Rotational grazing had greater SOC than continuous grazing and was not different from no grazing. The positive responses of SOC to rotational grazing could create climate change mitigation opportunities. Grazing strategy comparisons were minimally conditioned by aridity class (i.e., arid, subhumid, and humid); however, complete observations were notably limited or missing for many rotational grazing comparisons. For continuous and no grazing strategy comparisons, we found that grazing management can significantly influence soil function and health outcomes; however, site-specific environmental factors play important moderating roles. Greater coordination across regional, national, and global efforts, as well as consistent guidelines for soil health evaluation, would help overcome these knowledge gaps and vastly improve our collective understanding of grazing impacts on soil health, providing greater management and policy impacts.",Animals; *Carbon; Feeding Behavior; *Livestock; Soil/*chemistry
478,included,"Roles of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers in carbon sequestration in a Chinese agricultural ecosystem","Previously, most carbon (C) sequestration research focused on the effects of nitrogen (N) fertilization on soil organic C sequestration rather than on the separate effects of synthetic phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) and the integrated effect of NPK. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize 84 long-term trials with 385 paired comparisons to quantify the variance of soil C storage in response to synthetic fertilizer addition. Compared with unfertilized soil, higher C storage was observed in soils fertilized with NPK, N, P, and K (10, 5, 5, and 2%, respectively) at a depth of 0-20 cm, and changes in soil C storage were dependent on the cropping system, experimental duration, geographic region, and fertilization rate. Soils fertilized with NPK and N in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and maize (Zea mays) cropping systems in the northern region of China had greater soil C storage. The greatest increase in C storage occurred in soils fertilized with P in rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat cropping systems. Additionally, the ratio of N/P added as fertilizer was negatively related to soil C storage. When N, P, and K were applied together, N and P fertilizers explained 49 and 11% of the variability in soil C storage, while the contribution of K was unclear. This study reveals the important roles of P and N fertilizers in soil C sequestration. We estimated that fertilizer use resulted in the sequestration of 947.2-1093 Tg C in China's croplands from 1980 to 2014.",Ecosystems; Fertilizers; Grain (agricultural product); Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Phosphorus; Potassium; Potassium fertilizers; Agricultural ecosystems; Carbon sequestration; Fertilization rates; Integrated effects; N and P fertilizer; Rice (oryza sativa); Synthetic fertilizers; Unfertilized soils; Soils; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural soil; fertilizer application; soil carbon; China; Oryza sativa; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays
479,excluded,Efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders in older people: a meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials,"OBJECTIVES: To review the magnitude and duration of and factors associated with effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders in older people. DESIGN: Electronic literature databases and the Cochrane Trials Registry were searched for articles. A systematic critical review, random-effects meta-analysis, and metaregression of randomized controlled trials were conducted. SETTING: Community outpatient clinics. PARTICIPANTS: People with diagnoses of anxiety disorders. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome measures of anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included. CBT was significantly more effective than treatment as usual or being on a waiting list at reducing anxiety symptoms at 0-month follow-up, with the effect size being moderate, but when CBT was compared with an active control condition, the between-group difference in favor of CBT was not statistically significant, and the effect size was small. At 6-but not 3-or 12-month follow-up, CBT was significantly more effective at reducing anxiety symptoms than an active control condition, although the effect size was again small. Meta-regression analyses revealed only one factor (type of control group) to be significantly associated with the magnitude of effect sizes. CONCLUSION: The review confirms the effectiveness of CBT for anxiety disorders in older people but is suggestive of lower efficacy in older than working-age people. The small effect sizes in favor of CBT over an active control condition illustrate the need to investigate other treatment approaches that may be used to substitute or augment CBT to increase the effectiveness of treatment of anxiety disorders in older people.

In this non-blinded, multicenter, prospective study, all patients were started on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with heated humidification and a wireless modem. They all received standardized CPAP education and setup. Patients in the TH group (n = 58) received an automated series of text messages and/or e-mails that were triggered by preset conditions. Patients in the SOC group (n = 64) received scheduled calls on days 1, 7, 14, and 30. Additional contacts were allowed for patients in both groups as deemed clinically necessary. Coaching labor was calculated by totaling the number and type of patient contacts and assigning historical time values. One hundred twenty-two patients were included in the final analysis. There were no statistically significant differences between the TH and SOC groups for Medicare adherence (83 vs. 73 %), daily CPAP usage (5.1 +/- A 1.9 h vs. 4.7 +/- A 2.1 h), CPAP efficacy (mean residual apnea-hypopnea index (3.0 +/- A 4.1/h vs. 2.8 +/- A 3.8/h), or change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (-5.8 +/- A 5.5 vs. -5.1 +/- A 5.9), although all trends favored the TH group. There was, however, a significant reduction in the number of minutes coaching required per patient in the TH vs. SOC group (23.9 +/- A 26 vs. 58.3 +/- A 25, 59 % reduction; p < 0.0001).

481,included,Soil carbon sequestration rates under Mediterranean woody crops using recommended management practices: A meta-analysis,"Mediterranean woody crops, such as olive and almond farming, and vineyards are usually cultivated in
soils low in organic matter, with limited water availability and frequently on medium to steep slopes.
Therefore, when conventionally cultivated, soils of these cropping systems are net sources of CO2
(throughout soil erosion and organic carbon mineralization). A promising option to sequester carbon (C)
in these cropping systems is the implementation of recommended management practices (RMPs), which
include plant cover in the inter-row area, minimum or no tillage and off- and on-farm organic matter
amendments. However, the effects of RMPs on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in these cropping systems
are widely overlooked, despite the critical importance of estimating their contribution on CO2 emissions
for policy decisions in the agriculture sector in Mediterranean regions. We therefore conducted a metaanalysis
to derive a C response ratio, soil C sequestration rate and soil C sequestration efficiency under
RMPs, compared to conventional management of olive and almond orchards, and vineyards (144 data
sets from 51 references). RMPs included organic amendments (OA), plant cover (CC) and a combination of
the two (CMP). The highest soil C sequestration rate (5.3 t C ha 1 yr 1) was observed following the
application OA in olive orchards (especially after olive mill pomace application), whereas CC
management achieved the lowest C sequestration rates (1.1, 0.78 and 2.0 t C ha 1 yr 1, for olive
orchards, vineyards and almond orchards, respectively). Efficiency of soil C sequestration was greater
than 100% after OA and CMP managements, indicating that: i) some of the organic C inputs were
unaccounted for, and ii) a positive feedback effect of the application of these amendments on SOC
retention (e.g. reduction of soil erosion) and on protective mechanisms of the SOC which reduce CO2
emissions. Soil C sequestration rate tended to be highest during the
first years after the change of the
management and progressively decreased. Studies performed in Mediterranean sub-climates of low
annual precipitation had lower values of soil C sequestration rate, likely due to a lower biomass
production of the crop and other plant cover. Soil C sequestration rates in olive farming were much higher
than that of vineyards, mainly due to the application of higher annual doses of organic amendments. The
relatively high sequestration rate combined with the relative large spatial extent of these cropping
system areas suggests that the adoption of RMPs is a sustainable and efficient measure to mitigate
climate change.",meta-analysis
482,excluded,"Organic farm does not improve neither soil, or water quality in rural watersheds from southeastern brazil","This study was conducted in a rural region where there are conventional and organic farms, the agricultural production includes more than 20 million people, and the effect on environmental quality is still poorly known in terms of indicators. Our objectives were: (1) compare soils attributes to reference areas, (2) verifying if cultivated areas under different farm systems presented differences in the soils attributes, (3) evaluate the attributes of quality water of watersheds and comparing the results with limiting values established by environmental legislation, and (4) analyze the values considering three criterion: watersheds, climatic season, and region of the landscapes. The study was conducted in two rural watersheds that have similar biophysical features and located in the Ibitina municipality, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. However, one watershed encompasses farms where landowners largely use conventional agricultural systems. In the other watershed approximately 25% of the farms there are using an organic farm system. In the two watersheds soil samples were collected in sites covered with natural forest and in sites with agriculture (one watershed being organic and other being conventional). The attributes analyzed were soil bulk density (BD), concentrations of Carbon (C) and Nitrogen (N), C:N ratio, C Management Index, and the abundance of C-13 and N-15 in the soil organic matter. Water attributes were analyzed onsite or in laboratory after analysis of samples. Analyses included: air and water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, total of dissolved solids, total solids, electric conductivity, turbidity, total chloride, nitrate, total phosphorus and potassium. Regarding the soil attributes our database revealed that (1) the soils from cultivated sites of both watersheds presented significant differences from their respective forested areas, (2) Soil attributes are of equal quality in both farm systems. Concerning water attributes: (1) almost all attributes presented values better than the limiting values stipulated by Brazilian legislation; (2) the watersheds did not present significant differences of most of the attributes; (3) in the criteria climatic season data showed some significant differences. The data showed that the soils from the areas used for agricultural ends present belief that significantly worse soil quality in comparison to soils from sites still covered with natural forest. Neither the land cover nor farming system are altering the superficial water quality of the studied watershed and this appears to be related to the extensive percentage of natural remaining vegetation that still exists in both watersheds. The seasonality is an important force that drives the quality characteristics of the water. We highlight that the principles of organic agriculture should be practiced more efficiently and influences such as deforestation should be rigorously avoided. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Data was collected from 53 published studies. Results revealed a significant decrease in SOC stocks of 26 and 24% in the land-use change from forest to agroforestry at 0-15 and 0-30 cm respectively. The transition from agriculture to agroforestry significantly increased SOC stock of 26, 40, and 34% at 0-15, 0-30, and 0-100 cm respectively. The conversion from pasture/grassland to agroforestry produced significant SOC stock increases at 0-30 cm (9%) and 0-30 cm (10%). Switching from uncultivated/other land-uses to agroforestry increased SOC by 25% at 0-30 cm, while a decrease was observed at 0-60 cm (23%). Among agroforestry systems, significant SOC stocks increases were reported at various soil horizons and depths in the land-use change from agriculture to agrisilviculture and to silvopasture, pasture/grassland to agrosilvopastoral systems, forest to silvopasture, forest plantation to silvopasture, and uncultivated/other to agrisilviculture. On the other hand, significant decreases were observed in the transition from forest to agrisilviculture, agrosilvopastoral and silvopasture systems, and uncultivated/other to silvopasture. Overall, SOC stocks increased when land-use changed from less complex systems, such as agricultural systems. However, heterogeneity, inconsistencies in study design, lack of standardized sampling procedures, failure to report variance estimators, and lack of important explanatory variables, may have influenced the outcomes.",Agroforestry; Carbon sequestration; Soil organic carbon; Climate change; Meta-analysis

Methods: A decision analysis was performed based on a well-documented prospective cohort of 471 outpatients with stable chest pain with follow-up combined with best-available evidence from the literature. Outcomes were correct classification of patients as CAD- (no obstructive CAD), CAD+ (obstructive CAD without revascularization) and indication for Revascularization (using a combination reference standard), diagnostic costs, lifetime health care costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Parameter uncertainty was analyzed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: For men (and women), diagnostic cost savings were (sic)245 ((sic)252) for the CT-strategy as compared to the SOC-strategy. The CT-strategy classified 82% (88%) of simulated men (women) in the appropriate disease category, whereas 83% (85%) were correctly classified by the SOC-strategy. The long-term cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the SOC-strategy was dominated by the CT-strategy, which was less expensive (-(sic)229 in men, -(sic)444 in women) and more effective (+0.002 QALY in men, +0.005 in women). The CT-strategy was cost-saving (-(sic)231) but also less effective compared to SOC (-0.003 QALY) in men with a pre-test probability of >= 70%. The CT-strategy was cost-effective in 100% of simulations, except for men with a pretest probability >= 70% in which case it was 59%. Conclusions: The results suggest that a CT-based strategy is less expensive and equally effective compared to SOC in all women and in men with a pre-test probability <70%.

485,excluded,Defining synchronous oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review,"Introduction: Synchronous oligometastatic (sOM) disease is an oncological concept characterized by a limited cancer burden. Patients with oligometastasis could potentially benefit from local radical treatments. Despite the fact that the sOM condition is well recognized, a universal definition, including a specific definition for NSCLC, is not yet available. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the definitions of and staging requirements for use of the term synchronous oligometastatic in the context of NSCLC. Methods: The key issue was formulated in one research question according to the population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes strategy. The question was introduced in MEDLINE (OvidSP). All articles dealing with sOM NSCLC and providing a definition of synchronous oligometastasis in NSCLC were selected and analyzed. Results: A total of 21 eligible articles focusing on sOM NSCLC were retrieved and analyzed. In 17 studies (81%), patients had to be staged with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography of the brain, thoracic and abdominal computed tomography, and positron emission tomography. The total number of metastases allowed in the definitions ranged from one to eight, but in 38.1% of studies the maximum number was 5. Most of the publications did not define the number of involved organs or the maximum number of metastases per organ. For mediastinal lymph node involvement, only five articles (27.8%) counted this as a metastatic site. Conclusions: No uniform definition of sOM NSCLC could be retrieved by this systematic review. However, extended staging was mandated in most of the studies. An accepted oncological definition of synchronous oligometastasis is essential for patient selection to define prospective clinical trials.

A systematic review","Sustainable Intensification (SI) is a term that has been advanced to capture a concept that some consider as the 'third paradigm' for global agricultural development. However, the term has become subject to intense debates as well as scepticism and confusion regarding its meaning and the characteristics of production systems that could indicate SI (defined as ""indicators""). This has resulted in a proliferation of literature. We have conducted a systematic review of a sample of this literature analysing the most commonly suggested indicators of SI in order to investigate the extent to which the critiques of SI are valid in their viewpoints that SI is an oxymoron, underpinned by a productivist agenda, and to identify the critical issues in the development of a comprehensive and unambiguous set of SI indicators. From 633 articles identified by a search of relevant databases, a sample of 75 articles were selected and analysed using the NVIVO (TM) software. The results were organised according to a Socio-Ecological Systems (SES) framework comprising seven sub-systems or components - resource system, resource units, governance system, resource users, interactions, outcomes, and environment. A total of 218 indicators (both positive and negative) were identified. Most of these indicators focused on the 'outcomes' of agricultural systems with the majority being related to agricultural production. Few indicators were identified as relating to the economic and societal dimensions of food systems. Whilst this potentially suggested a productivist bias in the current interpretation of SI it was difficult to draw a black and white conclusion, since for the other system components, the majority of the indicators suggested appeared to take a more holistic point-of-view and emphasised both productivity and sustainability of agricultural systems. Our analysis suggests that a key reason why SI may be viewed with scepticism is a lack of specificity and elucidation of the rationale, scale, and farm type for which SI is proposed. Moreover, a number of the indicators were so loosely defined that the interventions they imply could be enacted without due consideration of the social impacts of their adoption. We conclude that there is need to develop SI indicators according to specific farming types and scales and also with more consideration of the social and political dimensions of food systems in order to promote a constructive dialogue around the concept of SI to take place. Unless the concept of SI is described and measured in such a holistic and inclusive manner, it is unlikely to be accepted as a valid descriptor of sought-after agricultural practices by players in the Third Sector.

Recombinant Epo (rEpo) is frequently used in the prevention and treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in the treatment of anemia associated with cancer. The expression of the Epo receptor (EpoR) in certain cancer cells has raised the possibility that exogenous rEpo may have direct effects on tumor cells with potential for stimulation of proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy and possibly metastasis. With recent clinical trials reporting negative outcomes with rEpo in the treatment of cancer-related anemia, with increased mortality in those who received rEpo, it has become necessary for nephrologists to analyze and review the effect of use of rEpo in treatment of anemia of CKD in patients who may have current or previously treated malignancy. It is known that CKD patients have an increased prevalence of certain malignancies (Wong G et al. Association of CKD and cancer risk in older people. J Am Soc Nephrol. 2009;20(6):1341-1350). If a CKD patient develops cancer or has a previous history of cancer, there is a dilemma which faces the treating nephrologist with respect to the use of rEpo in this situation.

We synthesized the results from 64 study sites and carried out a meta-analysis to quantify the changes in SOC following wetland cultivation and identify the underlying mechanisms. Although wetland cultivation led to a reduction in SOC under most conditions, wetland cultivation may result in an increase (p < .05) in SOC under the following conditions: the original wetland was a tidal or salt wetland, and the initial SOC content was < 30 g/kg. We also observed close correlations between SOC and total nitrogen, soil pH, and bulk density throughout the wetland cultivation process. These results indicate that it is possible to increase SOC following wetland cultivation. The changes in SOC after cultivation depended on wetland cultivation age, cultivation type, type of natural wetland hydrology or hydrology change type, and the initial SOC content. More generally, during the management of wetlands, the original SOC content before wetland cultivation and the balance of SOC inputs and outputs throughout the wetland cultivation process are important aspects that should be considered.",Wetland cultivation; Meta-analysis; Soil organic carbon; Global pattern

These projects have played an important role in sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere, which is considered to be a potential mitigation strategy for the effects of global climate change. However, carbon sequestration in soil (soil organic carbon, SOC) after afforestation or reforestation is not well understood, particularly for specific key forestry projects. In this study, the SOC change in the top 20cm of soil for each type of restoration implemented under China's Grain for Green Project (GGP) was quantified by a meta-analysis of data from published literature and direct field measurements. Soil carbon sequestration due to the GGP during 1999-2012 was estimated using data on the annual restoration area at provincial level and functions that relate SOC stock change to controlling factors (e.g., plantation age, forest zone, and type of forestation). Soil carbon sequestration of the GGP was estimated to be 156108 Tg C (95% confidence interval) for current restoration areas prior to 2013, with a mean accumulation rate of 128 Tg C yr(-1). The soil carbon sequestration potential of existing plantation zones is predicted to increase from 156108 Tg C in 2013 to 383 +/- 188 Tg C in 2050 under the assumption that all plantation areas are well preserved. Plantations in northwestern, southern, and southwestern zones contributed nearly 80% of total soil carbon sequestration, while soil C sequestration in northeastern China was much more variable. Improved data sources, measurements of SOC in the organic layer, greater sampling depth, and better distribution of sampling sites among GGP regions will reduce the uncertainty of the estimates made by this study.",Grain for Green Project; soil carbon sequestration; soil organic carbon; meta-analysis; uncertainty

We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of the current literature. Materials and Methods A comprehensive literature search was carried out identifying 19 articles that compare survival of patients with MOC and patients with SOC.

491,excluded,Processes influencing soil carbon storage following afforestation of pasture with pinus radiata at different stocking densities in new zealand,"Since 1992, afforestation with Pinus radiata D. Don in New Zealand has led to the establishment of over 600 000 ha of new plantation forests, about 85% of which are on fertile pastures used previously for grazing sheep and cattle. While this leads to rapid accumulation of carbon ( C) in vegetation, the effects of afforestation on soil C are poorly understood. We examined key soil C cycling processes at the ( former) Tikitere agroforestry experimental site near Rotorua, New Zealand. In 1973, replicated stands of P. radiata ( 100 and 400 stems/ha) were established on pastures, while replicated pasture plots were maintained throughout the first 26-year rotation. In 1996, soil C and microbial biomass C in 0 - 0.10 m depth soil, in situ soil respiration and net N mineralisation, and soil temperature were lower in the forest than in the pasture, and tended to decline with increasing tree-stocking density. In the 400 stems/ha stands, mineral soil C ( 0 - 0.50m depth) was lower than in the pasture ( 104 and 126 Mg C/ha, respectively; P< 0.01). Carbon accumulation in the forest floor during the first rotation of these forest stands was 12 Mg C/ha. Using the Rothamsted soil C model (Roth-C), we examined how changes in plant C inputs following afforestation might lead to changes in soil C content to 0.30 m depth. Steady-state pasture inputs of 9.0 Mg C/ha. year were estimated using Roth-C; these C inputs were assumed to decrease linearly during the first 12 years following tree establishment ( until canopy closure). Below-ground C inputs in the forest were estimated using steady-state relationships between litterfall and soil respiration; these inputs were assumed to increase linearly between years 1 and 12, after which they remained constant at 1.53 Mg C/ha. year until harvest. Measured changes in soil C (0-0.30 m) during the first rotation, in conjunction with the below-ground inputs, were used to estimate above-ground inputs ( as a proportion of total litterfall [3.81 Mg C/ha. year]) to the soil. Our results suggest 10% of litterfall C over one rotation actually entered the mineral soil. Using these results and estimates of additional C inputs to the soil from harvest slash and weeds following harvest, we found mineral-soil C stocks would continue to decline during second and third rotations of P. radiata; the magnitude of this decline depended in part on how much slash enters the mineral soil matrix. We confirmed our modelling approach by simulating soil C changes to within 8% over 19 years following afforestation of pasture at another previously studied site, Purukohukohu. Whether afforestation leads to an increase or decrease in mineral-soil C may depend on previous pasture management; in highly productive pastures, high C inputs to the soil may maintain soil C at levels that cannot be sustained when trees are planted onto these grasslands.",
492,excluded,Review and meta-analysis of organic matter in cultivated soils in southern Africa,"Soil organic matter (SOM) is tightly linked to soil quality, but cultivation generally causes a decline in SOM, reducing soil quality and releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Internationally, countries are expected to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and compile and update GHG inventories. Many developing countries, such as those in southern Africa, do not have reliable information regarding SOM levels in cultivated soils, changes over time and best management practices to maintain or even restore SOM. A review was conducted to collate published research on SOM [or its indicator elements, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)] in cultivated fields in southern Africa. A total of 84 publications were assessed, and information such as date, location, SOM/soil organic carbon (SOC) and clay content and key findings were recorded. Most of the publications (90 %) were published post-1990. The spatial distribution of these studies is very non-uniform. A decline of 25-53 % in SOC due to cultivation was evident for cultivated fields in different precipitation zones in southern Africa, with SOC ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 %. These values correlate relatively well with existing SOC maps. A strong correlation between SOC and clay content in natural soil is weakened following cultivation. Carbon sequestration and GHG emission dynamics under various management systems and for different climatic regions, as well as how field crop production can play a role in mitigating climate change, are poorly understood. Intensified monitoring by multi-institutional collaboration is recommended to address this issue.",Agriculture; Carbon sequestration; Clay; Greenhouse gas emissions; Nitrogen; Nitrous oxide
493,excluded,Biochar and forest restoration: a review and meta-analysis of tree growth responses,"Biochar, or charcoal intended for use as a soil amendment, has received great attention in recent years as a means of enhancing carbon sequestration and soil properties in agricultural systems. Here we address the potential for biochar use in the context of forest restoration, reviewing relevant experimental studies on biochar use in forest ecosystems, the properties of chars generated from wood waste material, and available data on tree growth responses to biochar. To our knowledge the earliest mention of char use as a soil amendment is actually specifically in the context of forest restoration (in the 1820s in Scotland). Wood waste biochars have an unusual set of properties that suggest their applicability in a forest restoration context: namely, high recalcitrance promoting long-lasting effects, retention of cations, anions, and water, in the soil, sorptive properties that can reduce bioavailability of a wide range of toxic materials, and relative ease of production from locally available feedstocks. A meta-analysis of recent studies on biochar responses of woody plants indicates a potential for large tree growth responses to biochar additions, with a mean 41 % increase in biomass. Responses are especially pronounced at early growth stages, and appear to be higher in boreal and tropical than in temperate systems, and in angiosperms than conifers; however, there is high variability, and field studies are few. The properties of biochars also vary greatly depending on feedstock and pyrolysis conditions; while this complicates their use, it provides a means to design biochars for specific restoration situations and objectives. We conclude that there is great promise for biochar to play an important role in a wide variety of forest restoration efforts, specifically as a replacement product for other forms of organic matter and liming agents.",Biochar; Charcoal; Feedstock; Forest restoration; Pyrolysis; Soil carbon
494,excluded,Tocilizumab in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a cost-effectiveness analysis in the uk,"Since receiving a positive recommendation in England, Wales and Scotland, tocilizumab (TCZ) is one of the options available to clinicians for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in the UK. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of adding TCZ to the current treatment sequence of RA patients from a UK payer's perspective over a patient lifetime horizon. An individual sampling model was developed to synthesise all clinical and economic inputs. Two scenarios were explored separately: patients contraindicated to methotrexate (MTX) and those MTX tolerant. For each scenario, the analysis compared three strategies. The standard of care (SoC) strategy included a sequence of the most commonly prescribed biologics; the other two comparator strategies considered the addition of TCZ to SoC at first line and second line. Patient characteristics were representative of UK patients. Treatment efficacy and quality-of-life evidence were synthesised from clinical trials and secondary sources. An analysis of a patient registry informed the model parameters regarding treatment discontinuation. The safety profile of all treatments in a given strategy was based on a network meta-analysis and literature review. Resource utilisation, treatment acquisition, administration, monitoring and adverse event treatment costs were considered. All costs reflect 2012 prices. Uncertainty in model parameters was explored by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. In the MTX-contraindicated population, if TCZ was added to the SoC in first line, the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was A 7,300 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained; if added in second line, the estimated ICER was A 11,400 pound per QALY. In the MTX-tolerant population, the estimated costs and QALYs of the TCZ strategy were similar to those of the SoC strategy. Sensitivity analysis showed that parameters that affect the treatment cost (such as patient weight) can have a noticeable impact on the overall cost-effectiveness results. The majority of the other sensitivity analyses resulted in modest changes to the ICER. For the treatment of RA in MTX-tolerant and contraindicated patients, the addition of TCZ to the SoC was estimated to be a cost-effective strategy.",
495,included,Reduction of forest soil respiration in response to nitrogen deposition,"The use of fossil fuels and fertilizers has increased the amount of biologically reactive nitrogen in the atmosphere over the past century. As a consequence, forests in industrialized regions have experienced greater rates of nitrogen deposition in recent decades. This unintended fertilization has stimulated forest growth, but has also affected soil microbial activity, and thus the recycling of soil carbon and nutrients. A meta-analysis suggests that nitrogen deposition impedes organic matter decomposition, and thus stimulates carbon sequestration, in temperate forest soils where nitrogen is not limiting microbial growth. The concomitant reduction in soil carbon emissions is substantial, and equivalent in magnitude to the amount of carbon taken up by trees owing to nitrogen fertilization. As atmospheric nitrogen levels continue to rise, increased nitrogen deposition could spread to older, more weathered soils, as found in the tropics; however, soil carbon cycling in tropical forests cannot yet be assessed.",biological activity in soil; carbon; carbon sequestration; decomposition; emission; forest soils; forests; microbial activities; nitrogen; nitrogen fertilizers; soil organic matter; soil types; temperate soils; cycling; carbon cycle; nutrient cycling. organic matter in soil. soil respiration. temperate forests

Treatments, selected for inter-row management, to re-install soil functionality were based on compost or other organic amendments (COMP), green manure (GM), and dry mulching (DM) strategies using winter legumes and cereals. Cover crops were seeded in fall and mown in late spring, leaved in the ground for mulching in DM or incorporated into the uppermost soil layers in GM. Such approaches were investigated in six vineyards in Italy, six in France, and two vineyards in Slovenia and Turkey. The results showed that COMP significantly increased total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (Ntot) in the topsoil after one year of application. Also DM tends to increase significantly TOC in the topsoil, but only after two years.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical aspects and treatment outcomes of acute upper extremity thromboembolism. Methods: From January 2007 to March 2010, seven patients underwent the management of upper extremity thromboembolism in three Seoul National University (SNU)-affiliated hospitals. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records. Results: The mean age was 64.6 years (range 48 similar to 93 years) and 4 patients (57.1%) were female. Distribution of the thromboembolism were 4 in brachial, 1 in axillary plus brachial, 1 in ulnar and radial, and 1 in axillary artery, respectively. Time from symptom onset to presentation was 3.5 days (range 1 similar to 10 days). Primary treatment modality were Fogarty catheter embolectomy in 3 cases, bypass surgery in 1 case, and urokinase thrombolysis in 2 cases. A patient without symptoms was treated conservatively. Patients receiving primary thrombolytic therapy underwent surgical approach due to recurred thromboembolism during admission. In our 11.2 months of mean follow-up, there was recurrence but 1 patient died from cerebral infarction after 1.5 year of discharge. Conclusion: In this study, functional outcome of acute upper extremity ischemia following appropriate treatments was excellent. Key features of treatment are shortening the time interval of diagnosis to primary treatment, proper anticoagulation, and treatment of underlying conditions.

498,included,Effect of different fertilization modes on soil organic carbon sequestration in paddy fields in South China: A meta-analysis,"Evidences have shown that fertilizer application could affect soil organic carbon (SOC) content in cropland. South China is the main production region of rice, in which many different fertilization practices have been widely used during the last several decades, but the effect of different fertilization modes on SOC sequestration in paddy fields in this region was scarcely studied. Based on 274 samples taken from 44 paddy field experimental sites in South China, a meta-analysis was performed to quantify the relative annual change of SOC content (RAC) and SOC sequestration duration in paddy fields under five fertilization modes (inorganic nitrogen fertilization, N; inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization, NP; inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilization, NPK; organic fertilization, 0; and inorganic combined with organic fertilization, OF). The results showed that the RAC under the five fertilization modes was 0-0.4gkg(-1) yr(-1), with increments of 0.19 and 0.23 g kg(-1) yr(-1) in double cropping systems and triple cropping systems, respectively. The RAC under the 0 and OF treatments was higher than that under the N, NP and NPK treatments and was the highest (0.32 g kg(-1) yr(-1)) under OF among the five treatments. The SOC accumulation rate decreased with time, and the SOC sequestration duration under N, NP, NPK, 0 and OF was approximately 23, 28, 46, 64 and 55 years, respectively. The accumulation enhancement rate of SOC over the whole SOC sequestration period under the N, NP, NPK, 0 and OF treatments was approximately 12.9%, 23.4%, 29.3%, 47.2% and 55.1%, respectively. The OF treatment performed the largest potential for SOC sequestration in paddy fields in South China under long-term conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

499,excluded,Vitamin d treatment for the prevention of falls in older adults: systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and quantitatively synthesize the effect of vitamin D therapy on fall prevention in older adults. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, LILACS, bibliographies of selected articles, and previous systematic reviews through February 2009 were searched for eligible studies. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults (aged >= 60) who participated in randomized controlled trials that both investigated the effectiveness of vitamin D therapy in the prevention of falls and used an explicit fall definition. MEASUREMENTS: Two authors independently extracted data, including study characteristics, quality assessment, and outcomes. The I-2 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity in a random-effects model. RESULTS: Of 1,679 potentially relevant articles, 10 met inclusion criteria. In pooled analysis, vitamin D therapy (200-1,000 IU) resulted in 14% (relative risk (RR) = 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.79-0.93; I-2 = 7%) fewer falls than calcium or placebo (number needed to treat = 15). The following subgroups had significantly fewer falls: community-dwelling (aged <80), adjunctive calcium supplementation, no history of fractures or falls, duration longer than 6 months, cholecalciferol, and dose of 800 IU or greater. Meta-regression demonstrated no linear association between vitamin D dose or duration and treatment effect. Post hoc analysis including seven additional studies (17 total) without explicit fall definitions yielded smaller benefit (RR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.87-0.98) and more heterogeneity (I-2 = 36%) but found significant intergroup differences favoring adjunctive calcium over none (P = .001). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D treatment effectively reduces the risk of falls in older adults. Future studies should investigate whether particular populations or treatment regimens may have greater benefit.

This study is descriptive and analytic, with a systematic integration of the contemporary knowledge base on the salutogenic research published in 1992 - 2003. This review includes 458 scientific publications and 13 doctoral theses on salutogenesis. In all, 32 papers had the main objective of investigating the relationship between SOC and QoL. This study is based on scientific publications in eight authorised databases, doctoral theses and available books. The SOC seems to have an impact on the QoL; the stronger the SOC, the better the QoL. Furthermore, longitudinal studies confirm the predictive validity of the SOC for a good QoL. The findings correspond to the core of the Ottawa Charter - that is, the process of enabling people to live a good life. Therefore, a certain possibility to modify and extend the health construct is becoming discernible, implicating a construct including salutogenesis and QoL.

501,included,Fire effects on temperate forest soil C and N storage,"Temperate forest soils store globally significant amounts of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Understanding how soil pools of these two elements change in response to disturbance and management is critical to maintaining ecosystem services such as forest productivity, greenhouse gas mitigation, and water resource protection. Fire is one of the principal disturbances acting on forest soil C and N storage and is also the subject of enormous management efforts. In the present article, we use meta-analysis to quantify fire effects on temperate forest soil C and N storage. Across a combined total of 468 soil C and N response ratios from 57 publications (concentrations and pool sizes), fire had significant overall effects on soil C (-26%) and soil N (-22%). The impacts of fire on forest floors were significantly different from its effects on mineral soils. Fires reduced forest floor C and N storage (pool sizes only) by an average of 59% and 50%, respectively, but the concentrations of these two elements did not change. Prescribed fires caused smaller reductions in forest floor C and N storage (-46% and -35%) than wildfires (-67% and -69%), and the presence of hardwoods also mitigated fire impacts. Burned forest floors recovered their C and N pools in an average of 128 and 103 years, respectively. Among mineral soils, there were no significant changes in C or N storage, but C and N concentrations declined significantly (-11% and -12%, respectively). Mineral soil C and N concentrations were significantly affected by fire type, with no change following prescribed burns, but significant reductions in response to wildfires. Geographic variation in fire effects on mineral soil C and N storage underscores the need for region-specific fire management plans, and the role of fire type in mediating C and N shifts (especially in the forest floor) indicates that averting wildfires through prescribed burning is desirable from a soils perspective.",carbon sinks; fire; forest management; meta-analysis; soil carbon; soil; nitrogen; temperate forests
502,included,"Soil organic carbon stock in grasslands: Effects of inorganic fertilizers, liming and grazing in different climate settings","Grasslands store about 34% of the global terrestrial carbon (C) and are vital for the provision of various ecosystem services such as forage and climate regulation. About 89% of this grassland C is stored in the soil and is affected by management activities but the effects of these management activities on C storage under different climate settings are not known. In this study, we synthesized the effects of fertilizer (nitrogen and phosphorus) application, liming and grazing regime on the stock of SOC in global grasslands, under different site specific climatic settings using a meta-analysis of 341 datasets. We found an overall significant reduction (-8.5%) in the stock of SOC in global managed grasslands, mainly attributable to grazing (-15.0%), and only partially attenuated by fertilizer addition (+6.7%) and liming (+5.8%), indicating that management to improve biomass production does not contribute sufficient organic matter to replace that lost by direct removal by animals. Management activities had the greatest effect in the tropics (-22.4%) due primarily to heavy grazing, and the least effect in the temperate zone (-4.5%). The negative management effect reduced significantly with increasing mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation in the temperate zone, suggesting that temperate grassland soils are potential C sinks in the face of climate change. For a sustainable management of grasslands that will provide adequate forage for livestock and mitigate climate change through C sequestration, we recommend that future tropical grassland management policies should focus on reducing the intensity of grazing. Also, to verify our findings for temperate grasslands and to better inform land management policy, future research should focus on the impacts of the projected climate change on net greenhouse gas exchange and potential climate feedbacks.",Grassland soils; Soil improvement; Land management; Climate change; Carbon sequestration; Nitrogen amendment
503,excluded,Greenhouse gas inventories: deriving soil organic carbon change factors and assessing soil depth relevance in argentinean semiarid chaco,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the main terrestrial carbon (C) reservoir. Land use change has depleted SOC stocks and released large amounts of C dioxide (CO2). Thus, the development of reliable tools for SOC stock monitoring at large scale is fundamental to face climate change. Argentinean Semiarid Chaco (ASC) is a deforestation hotspot, but CO2 emissions from soil has been barely assessed. Deforested area was converted into cropland or grassland. We used empirical data to model SOC stocks under native forest (SOCref) and the RothC model to estimate SOC stock change factors under cropland (Fc) and grasslands (Fg) in the ASC. These SOCrefs and stock change factors were applied in a Tier 2 (T2) C inventory, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) proposal. We used SOC vertical distribution models to estimate SOC stock at 0-100 cm soil depth from estimated SOC stocks at 0-30 cm, the default soil depth of IPCC C inventory method. The T2 was run for 1976 through 2012 and under three hypothetical land use change scenarios for 2012 through 2032. The scenarios were: i) land use change ceases, ii) land use change rate is the half of 1996-2012 land use change rate, and iii) land use change rate remains as in 1996-2012. Estimated average SOCref stock at 0-30 cm soil depth was 40 Mg C ha(-1) and varied between 35 and 51 Mg C ha(-1). Cropland was the main fate of deforested area and the land use with lower SOC stocks. Stock change factors and SOC stocks estimated with T2 were within the range of the empirical data reported in the ASC. However, research about SOC dynamics and land use change is incipient in the ASC and more empirical information is needed to validate T2 estimations. Deforestation in the ASC leads to high CO2 emissions from soil and the only scenario in which those emissions would be reduced is with deforestation cessation. Soil depth considered in greenhouse gas inventories is 0-30 cm, and this strongly underestimates CO2 emissions. We demonstrated that this limitation could be overcome by using SOC vertical distribution models to estimate deep SOC stock (up to 1 m) from estimated surface SOC stock. Hence, these models could be used to improve CO2 estimations from SOC inventories.",Deforestation; Soil organic matter; Land use change; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Carbon inventory
504,included,Understanding how long-term organic amendments increase soil phosphatase activities: Insight into phoD- and phoC-harboring functional microbial populations,"In context of the use of organic materials as alternatives for mineral fertilizer, it is important to understand how organic amendments influence soil extracellular phosphatase activities which accelerate the mineralization of organic phosphorus (P). To address this, the current study investigates the influence of organic amendments on acid (ACP) and alkaline (ALP) phosphatase activities in soils and how organic amendments influence these activities from the perspective of microbially-mediated pathways. Herein, a comprehensive meta-analysis of 599 measurements from 106 published studies around the world was performed as well as a field component sourced from a 30-year-old field experiment on fertilization. Based on meta-analysis, organic amendments increased average extracellular ACP and ALP activities by 22% and 53%, respectively, in comparison to the mineral-only fertilization. Observed increases in activities were consistent with significant increases in soil organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N) and available P contents, and microbial biomass C and N pools. According to the data from the long-term field experiment, we found phoD-harboring species encoding ALP were more closely correlated with phoC-harboring species encoding ACP in organically amended soils, and more network hubs were also observed by organic amendment. Soil C:P and N:P ratios, and microbial biomass C were the main predictors of the abundance, diversity, and composition of the phoC- and phoD-harboring populations. Further analysis revealed that the soil C:P ratio was identified as the dominant predictor of potential ACP and ALP activities. Our work highlights the importance in understanding how soil C:N:P stoichiometry mediates phosphatase-harboring populations in order to determine the downstream consequences of using organic amendments for increasing phosphatase activities.",Meta-analysis; Organic amendment; Phosphatase; Elemental stoichiometry; phoD gene; phoC gene; Microbial communities
505,included,Effects of forest degradation on microbial communities and soil carbon cycling: A global meta-analysis,"Aim: The aim was to explore how conversions of primary or secondary forests to plantations or agricultural systems influence soil microbial communities and soil carbon (C) cycling. Location: Global. Time period: 1993-2017. Major taxa studied: Soil microbes. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to examine effects of forest degradation on soil properties and microbial attributes related to microbial biomass, activity, community composition and diversity based on 408 cases from 119 studies in the world. Results: Forest degradation decreased the ratios of K-strategists to r-strategists (i.e., ratios of fungi to bacteria, Acidobacteria to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria to Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria+Actinobacteria to Proteobacteria+Bacteroidetes). The response ratios (RRs) of the K-strategist to r-strategist ratios to forest degradation decreased and increased with increased RRs of soil pH and soil C to nitrogen ratio (C:N), respectively. Forest degradation increased the bacterial alpha-diversity indexes, of which the RRs increased and decreased as the RRs of soil pH and soil C: N increased, respectively. The overall RRs across all the forest degradation types ranked as microbial C (-40.4%)> soil C (-33.3%)> microbial respiration (-18.9%)> microbial C to soil C ratio (qMBC; -15.9%), leading to the RRs of microbial respiration rate per unit microbial C (qCO(2)) and soil C decomposition rate (respiration rate per unit soil C), on average, increasing by +43.2 and +25.0%, respectively. Variances of the RRs of qMBC and qCO(2) were significantly explained by the soil C, soil C: N and mean annual precipitation. Main conclusions: Forest degradation consistently shifted soil microbial community compositions from K-strategist dominated to r-strategist dominated, altered soil properties and stimulated microbial activity and soil C decomposition. These results are important for modelling the soil C cycling under projected global land-use changes and provide supportive evidence for applying the macroecology theory on ecosystem succession and disturbance in soil microbial ecology.",carbon decomposition; forest degradation; land use; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbial metabolic quotient; soil carbon

However, the overall direction and magnitude of such alterations are poorly quantified. Here, 94 experimental studies were synthesized, using a meta-analysis approach, to quantify the changes of 20 variables associated with C and N cycles, including their pools, fluxes, and other related parameters in response to plant invasion. Pool variables showed significant changes in invaded ecosystems relative to native ecosystems, ranging from a 5% increase in root carbon stock to a 133% increase in shoot C stock. Flux variables, such as above-ground net primary production and litter decomposition, increased by 50-120% in invaded ecosystems, compared with native ones. Plant N concentration, soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations were 40, 30 and 17% higher in invaded than in native ecosystems, respectively. Increases in plant production and soil N availability indicate that there was positive feedback between plant invasion and C and N cycles in invaded ecosystems. Invasions by woody and N-fixing plants tended to have greater impacts on C and N cycles than those by herbaceous and nonN-fixing plants, respectively. The responses to plant invasion are not different among forests, grasslands, and wetlands. All of these changes suggest that plant invasion profoundly influences ecosystem processes.",carbon and nitrogen pools and fluxes; litter quality; meta-analysis; plant invasion; soil nitrogen availability
507,excluded,Does organic farming reduce environmental impacts? - A meta-analysis of European research,"Organic farming practices have been promoted as, inter alia, reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture. This meta-analysis systematically analyses published studies that compare environmental impacts of organic and conventional farming in Europe. The results show that organic farming practices generally have positive impacts on the environment per unit of area, but not necessarily per product unit. Organic farms tend to have higher soil organic matter content and lower nutrient losses (nitrogen leaching, nitrous oxide emissions and ammonia emissions) per unit of field area. However, ammonia emissions, nitrogen leaching and nitrous oxide emissions per product unit were higher from organic systems. Organic systems had lower energy requirements, but higher land use, eutrophication potential and acidification potential per product unit. The variation within the results across different studies was wide due to differences in the systems compared and research methods used. The only impacts that were found to differ significantly between the systems were soil organic matter content, nitrogen leaching, nitrous oxide emissions per unit of field area, energy use and land use. Most of the studies that compared biodiversity in organic and conventional farming demonstrated lower environmental impacts from organic farming. The key challenges in conventional farming are to improve soil quality (by versatile crop rotations and additions of organic material), recycle nutrients and enhance and protect biodiversity. In organic farming, the main challenges are to improve the nutrient management and increase yields. In order to reduce the environmental impacts of farming in Europe, research efforts and policies should be targeted to developing farming systems that produce high yields with low negative environmental impacts drawing on techniques from both organic and conventional systems.

508,excluded,Land-use contrasts reveal instability of subsoil organic carbon,"Combining nutrient dynamics (plant nutrient uptake and soil fertility) can help uncover mechanisms of shrub-grass interactions and assess the validity of the stress-gradient hypothesis, which predicts that facilitation between plants increases in stressful environments. However, how facilitation via shrub-mediated nutrient increases varies with precipitation is poorly resolved. We first synthesized a global dataset from 66 studies and evaluated how shrubs affected soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in grasslands along a precipitation gradient. We then made new measurements in a single-grassland type encroached by leguminous shrubs from the same genus (Caragana) to constrain the variations caused by combining different grassland types and shrubs traits in the meta-analysis. Specifically, we investigated how shrubs mediated N dynamics and how shrub-grass interactions varied along a precipitation gradient (147-342mm) in a temperate steppe of China. At the global scale, leguminous shrub-mediated effects on soil nutrients increased with precipitation, while no relationship was found for non-leguminous shrub. For the field experiment, greater N and lower N-15 in Caragana compared to non-leguminous shrub (reference shrub, Salsola collina) suggested active N-fixation in Caragana. We found that Caragana enhanced N concentration and leaf quality (low C:N ratio) in neighbouring plants more on mesic sites than on xeric sites. Thus, facilitation increased via higher soil N and with decreasing environmental stress, at least along this relatively arid precipitation gradient. Our results highlight the importance of precipitation in determining the nutritional facilitation to neighbouring grasses from encroaching leguminous shrubs. Conceptual frameworks for plant facilitation may therefore need to include shrub characteristics (N-fixers vs. non-fixers) and positive effects of higher precipitation on this type of facilitation to characterize plant interactions along stress gradients.

509,excluded,Which agricultural management interventions are most influential on soil organic carbon (using time series data)?,"Background: Loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) from agricultural land is identified as one of the major threats to soils, as it influences both fertility and the production of ecosystem services from agriculture. Losses of SOC across regions are often determined by monitoring in different land use systems. Results from agricultural field experiments can reveal increasing SOC stocks after implementation of specific management practices compared to a control, though in time series experiments the relative rate of change is often negative and implying an overall loss. Longterm agricultural field experiments are indispensable for quantifying absolute changes in SOC stocks under different management regimes. Since SOC responses are seldom linear over time, time series data from these experiments are particularly valuable. Methods: This systematic review is based on studies reporting time series data collated in a recently completed systematic map on the topic restricted to the warm temperate climate zone and the snow climate zone. These 53 studies were identified and selected systematically according to CEE guidelines. An update of the original search for studies will be repeated using Web of Science and Google Scholar to include newly published academic and grey literature in the time since the original search was performed in September 2013. Studies will be subject to critical appraisal of the internal and external validity, followed by full data extraction (meta-data describing study settings and quantitative study results). Where possible, studies will be included in a quantitative synthesis using time series meta-analytical approaches.

510,excluded,Predictions of soil surface and topsoil organic carbon content through the use of laboratory and field spectroscopy in the albany thicket biome of eastern cape province of south africa,"In recent years it has been shown that laboratory and field visible near infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS) allows for the accurate prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC) - more rapidly, less expensively, and at larger scales than conventional soil laboratory methods. VNIRS might find application in the restoration assessment of the degraded, semi-arid subtropical thickets of the Albany Thicket Biome (ATB) of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. During the twentieth century, the semi-arid forms of the ATB suffered heavy browsing by goats, transforming the dense closed-canopy shrubland into an open savannah-like system. This paper presents a study dealing with SOC estimation of soil surface (0-5 mm) and topsoil (0-200 mm) in the degraded ATB, through the combination of soil spectroscopy and partial least square regression (PLSR). Spectroscopic measurements and soil samples were collected along a transect in the ATB. The PLSR models developed with laboratory and field spectra gave good predictions of SOC, with root mean square error of validation (RMSEV) <5.0 and 5.5 g C kg(-1), respectively. The use of the full visible near-infrared spectral range gave better SOC predictions than using either visible or near-infrared separately. The resampling simulation of the field surface spectra to the 232 channels of the satellite-born EnMAP sensor gave good SOC predictions for laboratory conditions (RPD>2), but low accuracy (RMSE: 9.88 g C kg(-1)) for field model. The results of this research study indicated that, for the ATB, (i) combining soil spectroscopy and PLSR does favor accurate prediction of SOC.

511,excluded,Pastures to woodlands: changes in soil microbial communities and carbon following reforestation,"Reforestation of agricultural lands has the potential to sequester C, while providing other environmental benefits. It is well established that reforestation can have a profound impact on soil physicochemical properties but the associated changes to soil microbial communities are poorly understood. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify changes in soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities in soils collected from reforested pastures and compare then to remnant vegetation and un-reforested pastures. To address this aim, we collected soil from two locations (pasture and its adjacent reforested zone, or pasture and its adjacent remnant vegetation) on each of ten separate farms that covered the range of planting ages (0-30 years and remnant vegetation) in a temperate region of southeastern Australia. Soils were analysed for a range of physicochemical properties (including C and nutrients), and microbial biomass and community composition (PLFA profiles). Soil C:N ratios increased with age of tree planting, and soil C concentration was highest in the remnant woodlands. Reforestation had no clear impact on soil microbial biomass or fungal:bacterial ratios (based on PLFA's). Reforestation was associated with significant changes in the molecular composition of the soil microbial community at many farms but similar changes were found within a pasture. These results indicate that reforestation of pastures can result in changes in soil properties within a few decades, but that soil microbial community composition can vary as much spatially within pastures as it does after reforestation.

512,included,Fire frequency drives decadal changes in soil carbon and nitrogen and ecosystem productivity,"Fire frequency is changing globally and is projected to affect the global carbon cycle and climate(1-3). However, uncertainty about how ecosystems respond to decadal changes in fire frequency makes it difficult to predict the effects of altered fire regimes on the carbon cycle; for instance, we do not fully understand the long-term effects of fire on soil carbon and nutrient storage, or whether fire-driven nutrient losses limit plant productivity(4,5). Here we analyse data from 48 sites in savanna grasslands, broadleaf forests and needleleaf forests spanning up to 65 years, during which time the frequency of fires was altered at each site. We find that frequently burned plots experienced a decline in surface soil carbon and nitrogen that was non-saturating through time, having 36 per cent (+/- 13 per cent) less carbon and 38 per cent (+/- 16 per cent) less nitrogen after 64 years than plots that were protected from fire. Fire-driven carbon and nitrogen losses were substantial in savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests, but not in temperate and boreal needleleaf forests. We also observe comparable soil carbon and nitrogen losses in an independent field dataset and in dynamic model simulations of global vegetation. The model study predicts that the long-term losses of soil nitrogen that result from more frequent burning may in turn decrease the carbon that is sequestered by net primary productivity by about 20 per cent of the total carbon that is emitted from burning biomass over the same period. Furthermore, we estimate that the effects of changes in fire frequency on ecosystem carbon storage may be 30 per cent too low if they do not include multidecadal changes in soil carbon, especially in drier savanna grasslands. Future changes in fire frequency may shift ecosystem carbon storage by changing soil carbon pools and nitrogen limitations on plant growth, altering the carbon sink capacity of frequently burning savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests.",Calcium/analysis/metabolism; Carbon/*analysis/deficiency/*metabolism; Carbon Sequestration; *Ecosystem; Geographic Mapping; Grassland; Nitrogen/*analysis/deficiency/*metabolism; Phosphorus/analysis/metabolism; Potassium/analysis/metabolism; Soil/*chemistry; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Time Factors; Wildfires/*statistics & numerical data
513,excluded,Improving China's food and environmental security with conservation agriculture,"China has achieved impressive increases in agricultural output in recent decades. Yet, past approaches centred on a growing use of fertilizers, pesticides, fuel and water are not likely to achieve the required 30-50% additional increases in food production by mid-century. We show that efficiencies of production are falling and the costs of environmental harm are increasing. Agricultural innovations that improve natural capital are urgently needed. Conservation agriculture (CA) is now practised on >8Mha in China and is offering promising prospects of both enhanced yields and environmental services. Our meta-analysis of 60 papers with 395 observations in China shows notable benefits from CA. Mean yield increase was 4.5% or 263kgha(-1) for wheat, 8.3% or 424kgha(-1) for maize, and 1.65% or 250kgha(-1) for rice. In 34 datasets from 22 published papers (experimental duration: 2-17 years), 26 datasets (76.5%) show that CA increased yield and soil organic carbon (mean SOC increase of >3g.kg(-1) in 0-10cm soil depth) when compared with traditional tillage. Key priorities for the spread of more sustainable forms of agriculture in China are national policy and financial support, better coordination across agencies, and better extension for farmers.",agricultural sustainability; China; conservation agriculture; sustainable intensification
514,excluded,How does tillage intensity affect soil organic carbon? A systematic review protocol,"Background: Soils contain the greatest terrestrial carbon (C) pool on the planet. Since approximately 12 % of soil C is held in cultivated soils, management of these agricultural areas has a huge potential to affect global carbon cycling; acting sometimes as a sink but also as a source. Tillage is one of the most important agricultural practices for soil management and has been traditionally undertaken to mechanically prepare soils for seeding and minimize effects of weeds. It has been associated with many negative impacts on soil quality, most notably a reduction in soil organic carbon (SOC), although still a matter of considerable debate, depending on factors such as depth of measurement, soil type, and tillage method. No tillage or reduced intensity tillage are frequently proposed mitigation measures for preservation of SOC and improvement of soil quality, for example for reducing erosion. Whilst several reviews have demonstrated benefits to C conservation of no till agriculture over intensive tillage, the general picture for reduced tillage intensity is unclear. This systematic review proposes to synthesise an extensive body of evidence, previously identified through a systematic map. Methods: This systematic review is based on studies concerning tillage collated in a recently completed systematic map on the impact of agricultural management on SOC restricted to the warm temperate climate zone (i.e. boreo-temperate). These 311 studies were identified and selected systematically according to CEE guidelines. An update of the original search will be undertaken to identify newly published academic and grey literature in the time since the original search was performed in September 2013. Studies will be critically appraised for their internal and external validity, followed by full data extraction (meta-data describing study settings and quantitative study results). Where possible, studies will be included in meta-analyses examining the effect of tillage reduction ('moderate' (i.e. shallow) and no tillage relative to 'intensive' tillage methods such as mouldboard ploughing, where soil is turned over throughout the soil profile). The implications of the findings will be discussed in terms of policy, practice and research along with a discussion of the nature of the evidence base.",Agriculture; Conservation; Till; Plough; Farming; Land management; Climate change; Land use change; Carbon sequestration
515,excluded,Phase iii pilot study of dose escalation using conformal radiotherapy in prostate cancer: psa control and side effects,"Radical radiotherapy is a standard form of management of localised prostate cancer. Conformal treatment planning spares adjacent normal tissues reducing treatment-related side effects and may permit safe dose escalation. We have tested the effects on tumour control and side effects of escalating radiotherapy dose and investigated the appropriate target volume margin. After an initial 3 - 6 month period of androgen suppression, 126 men were randomised and treated with radiotherapy using a 2 by 2 factorial trial design. The initial radiotherapy tumour target volume included the prostate and base of seminal vesicles (SV) or complete SV depending on SV involvement risk. Treatments were randomised to deliver a dose of 64 Gy with either a 1.0 or 1.5 cm margin around the tumour volume (1.0 and 1.5 cm margin groups) and also to treat either with or without a 10 Gy boost to the prostate alone with no additional margin (64 and 74 Gy groups). Tumour control was monitored by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and clinical examination with additional tests as appropriate. Acute and late side effects of treatment were measured using the Radiation Treatment and Oncology Groups (RTOG) and LENT SOM systems. The results showed that freedom from PSA failure was higher in the 74 Gy group compared to the 64 Gy group, but this did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance with 5-year actuarial control rates of 71% (95% CI 58 - 81%) in the 74 Gy group vs 59% (95% CI 45 - 70%) in the 64 Gy group. There were 23 failures in the 74 Gy group and 33 in the 64 Gy group (Hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.38 - 1.10, P = 0.10). No difference in disease control was seen between the 1.0 and 1.5 cm margin groups (5-year actuarial control rates 67%, 95% CI 53 - 77% vs 63%, 95% CI 50 - 74%) with 28 events in each group (Hazard ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.50 - 1.86, P = 0.94). Acute side effects were generally mild and 18 weeks after treatment, only four and five of the 126 men had persistent greater than or equal to Grade 1 bowel or bladder side effects, respectively. Statistically significant increases in acute bladder side effects were seen after treatment in the men receiving 74 Gy (P = 0.006), and increases in both acute bowel side effects during treatment (P = 0.05) and acute bladder sequelae (P = 0.002) were recorded for men in the 1.5 cm margin group. While statistically significant, these differences were of short duration and of doubtful clinical importance. Late bowel side effects (RTOG greater than or equal to 2) were seen more commonly in the 74 Gy and 1.5 cm margin groups (P = 0.02 and P = 0.05, respectively) in the first 2 years after randomisation. Similar results were found using the LENT SOM assessments. No significant differences in late bladder side effects were seen between the randomised groups using the RTOG scoring system. Using the LENT SOM instrument, a higher proportion of men treated in the 74 Gy group had Grade greater than or equal to3 urinary frequency at 6 and 12 months. Compared to baseline scores, bladder symptoms improved after 6 months or more follow-up in all groups. Sexual function deteriorated after treatment with the number of men reporting some sexual dysfunction (Grade greater than or equal to1) increasing from 38% at baseline to 66% at 6 months and 1 year and 81% by year 5. However, no consistent differences were seen between the randomised groups. In conclusion, dose escalation from 64 to 74 Gy using conformal radiotherapy may improve long-term PSA control, but a treatment margin of 1.5 cm is unnecessary and is associated with increased acute bowel and bladder reactions and more late rectal side effects. Data from this randomised pilot study informed the Data Monitoring Committee of the Medical Research Council RT 01 Trial and the two studies will be combined in subsequent meta-analysis.",
516,excluded,Data-driven enzyme (denzy) model represents soil organic carbon dynamics in forests impacted by nitrogen deposition,"Soil microorganisms participate in almost all soil organic carbon (SOC) transformations, but they are not represented explicitly in the current generation of earth system models. This study used a data-driven approach to incorporate extracellular enzyme activity into the Terrestrial ECOsystem (TECO) model, and the updated version was named the Data-driven ENZYme (DENZY) model. DENZY is based on results from an extensive data synthesis, which show that the CN ratio is positively correlated with ligninase activity (R-2 = 0.50). The latter is inversely correlated to soil organic carbon storage. The DENZY model was parameterized using the revise database to information from a recent meta-analysis and tested for its ability to simulate SOC dynamics at Duke Forest (North Carolina, USA) from 1996 to 2007. DENZY can well simulate the observed negative relationship between ligninase activity and SOC under N deposition conditions (R-2 ranges from 0.61 to 0.89). Moreover, outputs from DENZY better matched the observed SOC than its prototype model with the same parameterization. This study provides a simple and straightforward approach to effectively use real-world observations to improve SOC projections in terrestrial biogeochemical models.",Soil organic carbon modelling; Meta-analysis; TECO; Ligninase activity; N deposition; Data driven modelling
517,excluded,The impact of conservation agriculture on smallholder agricultural yields: a scoping review of the evidence,"Widespread implementation of conservation agriculture (CA) in North and South America and Australia suggests significant farmer profitability achieved through some combination of sustained or increased agronomic productivity and reduced input costs. Many believe similar agronomic benefits can accrue to smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia (SA) for a broad array of crops and farming systems despite marked differences in biophysical and socio-economic environments across these regions. Our objectives were to characterize (1) the quality of existing research including an assessment of the relevance of previously published reviews and surveys to SSA and SA, and (2) the empirical evidence from SSA and SA for agronomic benefits derived from implementing zero tillage (ZT) including the identification of knowledge gaps. Mulching and rotation were considered as associated practices within systems. Among surveys and reviews, most syntheses of multiple, independent studies were either entirely qualitative or used overly simplistic approaches to data aggregation. Few reviews used meta-analysis or other rigorous statistics that permit assessment of outcome sensitivity to influential observations; in general, review protocol descriptions were not sufficient to ensure transparency and appropriate handling of common biases. A search and screening of peer-reviewed literature identified empirical studies on conservation tillage in SSA and SA for maize (22), rice (16), cowpea (10) and sorghum (8). In attempting to extract data for an unbiased, systematic review of CA and maize, we found few studies fully reported critical data or meta-data; most common omissions were the univariate statistics required for study use in meta-analyses and critical supporting or explanatory data on soil type, prevailing weather, and management practices including handling of crop residues. In the short-term, ZT generally resulted in lower yields than with conventional tillage (CT). Occasionally these reductions could be linked to direct effects (e.g. increased soil compaction in rice), but failure to adapt other managements (e.g. weed control) to the CA system was a common and confounding indirect effect. Sufficient maize data existed to demonstrate that negative impacts on yield ameliorated with time in some cases accompanied by higher soil water infiltration and soil organic matter, particularly when mulch was added. However, the low number of studies, the missing supporting data and the large variation in treatments made it difficult to infer general direct effects due to mulching or rotation. Well-designed long-term experiments on CA featuring sound agronomic practice and comprehensive documentation are largely missing from the literature. Future systematic reviews addressing agronomic impacts of CA interventions will require appropriate handling of within and between study variance as well as sensitivity analyses and quantitative assessments of publication bias; on-going and future empirical studies must report a minimum dataset encompassing valid statistical measures and comprehensive intervention descriptions that enable standardization and systematic approaches in syntheses. We propose a minimum dataset that is generic to competent agronomy with measurements that are increasingly low-cost and easy to achieve and should therefore be routine in field experiments quantifying and explaining crop and cropping system performance. Until a larger number of field studies provide such quantifying and explanatory data from key crops and representative cropping systems, it is not possible to make strong general conclusions about benefits of CA and ZT on yields and resource use efficiency of smallholder farmers.

518,included,Does agricultural crop diversity enhance soil microbial biomass and organic matter dynamics? A meta-analysis,"Our increasing dependence on a small number of agricultural crops, such as corn, is leading to reductions in agricultural biodiversity. Reductions in the number of crops in rotation or the replacement of rotations by monocultures are responsible for this loss of biodiversity. The belowground implications of simplifying agricultural plant communities remain unresolved; however, agroecosystem sustainability will be severely compromised if reductions in biodiversity reduce soil C and N concentrations, alter microbial communities, and degrade soil ecosystem functions as reported in natural communities. We conducted a meta-analysis of 122 studies to examine crop rotation effects on total soil C and N concentrations, and the faster cycling microbial biomass C and N pools that play key roles in soil nutrient cycling and physical processes such as aggregate formation. We specifically examined how rotation crop type and management practices influence C and N dynamics in different climates and soil types. We found that adding one or more crops in rotation to a monoculture increased total soil C by 3.6% and total N by 5.3%, but when rotations included a cover crop (i.e., crops that are not harvested but produced to enrich the soil and capture inorganic N), total C increased by 8.5% and total N 12.8%. Rotations substantially increased the soil microbial biomass C (20.7%) and N (26.1%) pools, and these overwhelming effects on microbial biomass were not moderated by crop type or management practices. Crop rotations, especially those that include cover crops, sustain soil quality and productivity by enhancing soil C, N, and microbial biomass, making them a cornerstone for sustainable agroecosystems.",meta-analysis

We question the data selection and analysis techniques that the authors used to assess the effect of biochar on crop yield, biochar stability in soil, and biochar production cost. Although the research article was not intended as a meta-analysis - and hence the data reported need not be analyzed with the full rigor of a systematic review - we assert that the employed data set, while containing a sufficient quantity of data, requires closer inspection and a more careful interpretation to avoid significant bias in the conclusions. Furthermore, we assert that proper implementation of biochar and inclusion of non-yield benefits in the analysis would render it more economically viable for both cropping system enhancement and C sequestration than portrayed by Bach etal.",Biochar; agriculture; uncertainty; economics; carbon sequestration

Design Systematic review of studies of delirium tools that explicitly included individuals with dementia. Setting Hospital. Participants Studies were included if delirium assessment tools were validated against standard criteria, and the presence of dementia was assessed according to standard criteria that used validated instruments. Measurements PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched for articles in English published between January 1960 and January 2012. Results Nine studies fulfilled the selection criteria. Of 1,569 participants, 401 had dementia, and 50 had delirium superimposed on dementia. Six delirium tools were evaluated. One study using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) with 85% of participants with dementia had high specificity (96100%) and moderate sensitivity (77%). Two intensive care unit studies that used the CAM for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) reported 100% sensitivity and specificity for delirium in 23 individuals with dementia. One study using electroencephalography reported sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 91% in a population with a 100% prevalence of dementia. No studies examined potential effects of dementia severity or subtype on diagnostic accuracy. Conclusions The evidence base on tools for detection of delirium superimposed on dementia is limited, although some existing tools show promise. Further studies of existing or refined tools with larger samples and more-detailed characterization of dementia are required to address the identification of delirium superimposed on dementia.

521,excluded,Warming induced changes in soil carbon and nitrogen influence priming responses in four ecosystems,"Soil contains the largest terrestrial pool of carbon (C), but how this pool will be affected by global change remains unknown. Warmer temperatures generally increase soil respiration, while additional C inputs from plants to soil can increase or decrease soil C decomposition rates through a phenomenon known as priming. Priming occurs when soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition rates change in response to a fresh substrate, though the mechanisms underlying priming are poorly understood. Here, we measured priming in four ecosystems during a seven-week incubation with weekly glucose additions. Soil was collected from field warming experiments in the four ecosystems, so our experiment assessed the influence of long-term warming on priming. All treatments exhibited negative priming (reduced SOM decomposition) after the first substrate pulse. Subsequent substrate pulses elicited variable responses, and the effect of long-term warming on priming was ecosystem-dependent. Priming was correlated with changes in soil C and N in response to warming: ecosystems that lost soil C and N over nine years of experimental warming exhibited low rates of priming (decreased SOM decomposition), while ecosystems that gained soil C and N in response to warming had high priming. Consequently, priming may accelerate C losses in ecosystems that exhibit warming-induced C increases, and vice versa, thus partially buffering soil C content against change.",SOM decomposition; Priming; Climate change; Warming

524,included,Do alternative irrigation strategies for rice cultivation decrease water footprints at the cost of long-term soil health?,"The availability of water is a growing concern for flooded rice production. As such, several water-saving irrigation practices have been developed to reduce water requirements. Alternate wetting and drying and mid-season drainage have been shown to potentially reduce water requirements while maintaining rice yields when compared to continuous flooding. With the removal of permanently anaerobic conditions during the growing season, water-saving irrigation can also reduce CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) emissions, helping reduce the impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the long-term impact of water-saving irrigation on soil organic carbon (SOC)-used here as an indicator of soil health and fertility-has not been explored. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effects of common water-saving irrigation practices (alternate wetting and drying and mid-season drainage) on (i) SOC, and (ii) GHG emissions. Despite an extensive literature search, only 12 studies were found containing data to constrain the soil C balance in both continuous flooding and water-saving irrigation plots, highlighting the still limited understanding of long-term impacts of water-saving irrigation on soil health and GHG emissions. Water-saving irrigation was found to reduce emissions of CH4 by 52.3% and increased those of CO2 by 44.8%. CO2eq emissions were thereby reduced by 18.6% but the soil-to-atmosphere carbon (C) flux increased by 25% when compared to continuous flooding. Water-saving irrigation was also found to have a negative effect on both SOC-reducing concentrations by 5.2%-and soil organic nitrogen-potentially depleting stocks by more than 100 kgN/ha per year. While negative effects of water-saving irrigation on rice yield may not be visible in short-term experiments, care should be taken when assessing the long-term sustainability of these irrigation practices because they can decrease soil fertility. Strategies need to be developed for assessing the more long-term effects of these irrigation practices by considering trade-offs between water savings and other ecosystem services.",alternate wetting and drying; mid-season drainage; soil organic carbon; rice; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide

Comprehensive understanding regarding effect of NT-proBNP guided care on patient-reported quality of life (QOL) remains unknown. Methods One hundred fifty-one subjects with HF due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction were randomized to either SOC HF management or care with a goal to reduce NT-proBNP values <= 1000 pg/mL. Effects of HF on QOL were assessed using the Minnesota Living with HF Questionnaire (MLHFQ) quarterly, with change (Delta) in score assessed across study procedures and as a function of outcome. Results Overall, baseline MLHFQ score was 30. Across study visits, QOL improved in both arms, but was more improved and sustained in the NT-proBNP arm (repeated measures P = .01); NT-proBNP patients showing greater reduction in MLHFQ score (-10.0 vs -5.0; P = .05), particularly in the physical scale of the questionnaire. Baseline MLHFQ scores did not correlate with NT-proBNP; in contrast, Delta MLHFQ scores modestly correlated with Delta NT-proBNP values (rho = .234; P = .006) as did relative Delta in MLHFQ score and NT-proBNP (rho = .253; P = .003). Considered in tertiles, less improvement in MLHFQ scores was associated with a higher rate of HF hospitalization, worsening HF, and cardiovascular death (P = .001).

526,excluded,Shifts in soil structure and soil organic matter in a chronosequence of set aside fields,"Set-aside is a commonly used practice worldwide to improve soil quality and fertility. However, the benefits of set-aside have not been quantified in a detailed manner and particularly in semi-arid environments where primary production, and hence C inputs to the soil, is constrained by water availability. Using a chronosequence of set-aside fields (0, 6 and 50 years), data were collected regarding the soil structure, addressed with the distribution of aggregate size classes, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen content at the surface soil layer (0-15 cm). Soil structure showed a rapid recovery in the 6-years set-aside field and approached the levels of 50-years set-aside field. The recovery of soil structure, however, was not accompanied by a significant increase in bulk soil or in any aggregate size class SOC. In the 50-years set-aside field, the SOC content was 62% higher compared to the 0-years and 6-years set-aside fields. In this field the SOC content reached identical contents in all aggregate size classes except for the silt-clay fraction. In the latter, lower SOC content was assessed which did not differ from the 0-years and 6-years set-aside fields. In a following step, the Carbon, Aggregation, and Structure Turnover (CAST) model was employed to simulate the evolution of soil structure and C sequestration with time. Overall, the CAST model successfully simulated the evolution of soil structure and SOC stocks and provided critical information about the time required to approach the optimum thresholds under the prevailing environmental conditions. The estimated low rates of C sequestration question the effectiveness of the set-aside practice to restore soil fertility in semi-arid environments. These findings outline the need to evaluate additional practices and/or combinations of practices (e.g addition of organic amendments) to improve its effectiveness. Future work should aim to evaluate such practices considering climatic constraints and soil properties.",Dzylands; Aggregates; Fertility restoration; C sequestration; CAST model
527,excluded,Long term farming systems affect soils potential for n2o production and reduction processes under denitrifying conditions,"N2O is a potent greenhouse gas with an atmospheric lifetime of 114 years which also contributes to ozone layer destruction. Mitigating N2O emissions is especially challenging to the agricultural sector that is responsible for the majority of anthropogenic N2O release. In order to develop effective mitigation strategies, a detailed understanding of drivers for N2O production and reduction in agriculturally managed soils is needed. Denitrification is recognized as one of the most important source processes for N2O emissions from soils. However, the last step in denitrification, the reduction of N2O to N-2 is the only known sink for N2O in soil. Although the impact of single parameters on denitrification is quite well documented, there is still a knowledge gap when it comes to the impact of complex farming systems on N2O production and reduction. In this experiment, we incubated soil samples from the DOK long term field trial in Therwil/Switzerland comparing organic (BIOORG) and conventional (CONMIN) farming systems with an a non-fertilized control (NOFERT). Soil samples were incubated under 90% WFPS after fertilization with (NH4NO3)-N-15 equivalent to a moderate fertilization event in the field with 40 kg N ha(-1). In order to assess soil's potential for N2O production and reduction, we combined direct measurements of denitrification end products N2O and N-2 with molecular analysis of functional denitrifying communities involved in NO and N2O reduction on DNA and mRNA levels. In order to monitor N cycling processes under the chosen conditions, stable isotope tracing was employed to quantify nitrification and NO3- consumption rates. Results revealed increased NO3- consumption and greatest potential for N2O emissions in BIOORG as a result of increased soil organic carbon contents. Production of N-2 was similar in BIOORG and CONMIN and significantly lower in NOFERT, most likely due to significantly decreased pH inhibiting N2O reduction. This caused the greatest N20/(inhibiting N2O reduction. This caused the greatest N2O/(N2O + N-2) ratios in NOFERT (0.88 +/- 0.02) followed by BIOORG (0.79 +/- 0.01) and CONMIN (0.68 +/- 0.02) (p < 0.001). Lowest N2O/(N2O + N-2) ratios in CONMIN were reflected by lowest N2O emissions and coincided with elevated nosZ transcript copies in the beginning of incubation. Although highest N2O emissions in BIOORG were detected, the incubation setup cannot directly be translated to field conditions.

528,excluded,Safety of intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections in osteoarthritis: outcomes of a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundSome controversy exists regarding the safety of intra-articular hyaluronic acid (IAHA) in the management of osteoarthritis (OA).ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to re-assess the safety profile of IAHA in patients with OA, through a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials.MethodsA comprehensive literature search was undertaken in the databases MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Scopus. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials that assessed adverse events (AEs) with IAHA in patients with OA were eligible for inclusion. Authors and/or study sponsors were contacted to obtain the full report of AEs. The primary outcomes were overall severe and serious AEs, as well as the following MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC)-related AEs: gastrointestinal, cardiac, vascular, respiratory, nervous system, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, musculoskeletal, renal and urinary disorders, infections and infestations, and hypersensitivity reaction.ResultsDatabase searches initially identified 1481 records. After exclusions according to the selection criteria, 22 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, and nine studies having adequate data were ultimately included in the meta-analysis. From the studies excluded according to the pre-specified selection criteria, 21 with other pharmacological OA treatments permitted during the trials were a posteriori included in a parallel qualitative synthesis, from which eight studies with adequate data were finally included in a parallel meta-analysis. Since this meta-analysis was designed to assess safety, the exclusion criterion on concomitant anti-OA medication was crucial. However, due to the high number of studies that allowed mainly concomitant oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), we decided to include them in a post hoc parallel analysis in order to compare the results from the two analyses. No statistically significant difference in odds was found between IAHA and placebo for all types of SOC-related disorders, except for infections and infestations, for which significantly lower odds were found with IAHA compared with placebo, both overall (odds ratio [OR]=0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40-0.93; I-2=0%) and in studies without concomitant anti-OA medication (OR=0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.89). There were significant increased odds of reporting serious AEs with IAHA compared with placebo, both overall (OR=1.78, 95% CI 1.21-2.63; I-2=0%) and in studies with concomitant anti-OA medication (OR=1.78, 95% CI 1.10-2.89), but not in studies without concomitant anti-OA medication (OR=1.78, 95% CI 0.92-3.47).ConclusionsUsing the available data on studies without any concomitant anti-OA medication permitted during clinical trials, IAHA seems not to be associated with any safety issue in the management of OA. However, this evidence was associated with only a low to moderate certainty. A possible association with increased risk of serious AEs, particularly when used with concomitant OA medications, requires further investigation.",
529,excluded,Nitrogen deposition weakens plant-microbe interactions in grassland ecosystems,"Soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stoichiometry is a main driver of ecosystem functioning. Global N enrichment has greatly changed soil C:N ratios, but how altered resource stoichiometry influences the complexity of direct and indirect interactions among plants, soils, and microbial communities has rarely been explored. Here, we investigated the responses of the plant-soil-microbe system to multi-level N additions and the role of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and inorganic N stoichiometry in regulating microbial biomass in semiarid grassland in northern China. We documented a significant positive correlation between DOC and inorganic N across the N addition gradient, which contradicts the negative nonlinear correlation between nitrate accrual and DOC availability commonly observed in natural ecosystems. Using hierarchical structural equation modeling, we found that soil acidification resulting from N addition, rather than changes in the plant community, was most closely related to shifts in soil microbial community composition and decline of microbial respiration. These findings indicate a down-regulating effect of high N availability on plant-microbe interactions. That is, with the limiting factor for microbial biomass shifting from resource stoichiometry to soil acidity, N enrichment weakens the bottom-up control of soil microorganisms by plant-derived C sources. These results highlight the importance of integratively studying the plant-soil-microbe system in improving our understanding of ecosystem functioning under conditions of global N enrichment.",

The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) previously developed The AGS Guiding Principles for the Care of Older Adults With Multimorbidity using a systematic review of the literature and consensus. The objective of the current work was to translate these principles into a framework of Actions and accompanying Action Steps for decision making for clinicians who provide both primary and specialty care to older people with MCCs. A work group of geriatricians, cardiologists, and generalists: (1) articulated the core MCC Actions and the Action Steps needed to carry out the Actions; (2) provided decisional tips and communication scripts for implementing the Actions and Action Steps, using commonly encountered situations: (3) performed a scoping review to identify evidence-based, validated tools for carrying out the MCC Actions and Action Steps; and (4) identified potential barriers to, and mitigating factors for, implementing the MCC Actions. The recommended MCC Actions include: (1) identify and communicate patients' health priorities and health trajectory; (2) stop, start, or continue care based on health priorities, potential benefit vs harm and burden, and health trajectory; and (3) align decisions and care among patients, caregivers, and other clinicians with patients' health priorities and health trajectory. The tips and scripts for carrying out these Actions are included in the full MCC Action Framework available in the supplement ().

531,excluded,Conversion from temperate secondary forests into plantations (larix spp.): impact on belowground carbon and nutrient pools in northeastern china,"Conversions from natural broad-leaved forests into conifer plantations have been increasing over the past half century worldwide, especially in China. However, the impacts of plantation afforestation on macronutrient and micronutrient pools combined with litter, soil, and roots have not been well quantified. We compared macronutrient and micronutrient pools in litter, fine roots, and at 0- to 80-cm soil depths of paired secondary forests and larch plantations. The results showed that compared with natural forest soils, plantation soils exhibited lower concentrations and stocks of C, as well as lower fine root biomass at 0- to 10-cm depth. In contrast, the K, Fe, Mn, and Cu pools in the larch plantations were greater by 27-44% for the 20- to 40-cm depth. Furthermore, soil N, P, Ca, and Mg pools and stoichiometry of C/N/P in litter, soil, and fine roots did not differ significantly in the larch plantation relative to secondary forests. These results suggest that the conversion from secondary forests to larch plantations only decreases soil C pools but does not lead to reductions in other nutrient pools. Our results also showed that there were less C and nutrients in roots and more C and nutrients accumulated in litter of larch plantations compared with secondary forests. In conclusion, converting secondary forests to larch plantations changed the vertical distribution of C and nutrient pools in litter, soil, and root. The results suggest that C and nutrient pools in soils should be considered at levels below 40 cm in depth when evaluating C and nutrient change with afforestation.",C pool; fine root biomass; larch plantation; nutrient pool; secondary forest
532,excluded,Attachment states of mind in adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder and/or depressive disorders: a controlled study,"Little is known about the contribution of attachment insecurity to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), though speculations have been extensive. We aimed to study how states of mind (SoM) with regard to attachment relate to OCD with and without depressive disorder (DD). We interviewed 100 adolescents, 25 each with OCD, DD, OCD plus DD and general population controls, using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) to assess attachment SoM. In the AAI, interviewees are asked about both generalized/semantic and biographical/episodic descriptions of childhood experience. Discourse styles are coded and classified by a blinded coder. While about half of the adolescents from the general population had secure SoM (52%), most adolescents in the clinical groups did not: OCD 12%; DD 8%; and DD + OCD 4% (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.0001). SoM with regard to attachment profiles differed significantly across the groups with 60% of participants with OCD classified as dismissing (Ds), 40% of the DD group as unresolved with regard to loss or abuse (U) and 28% as cannot classify, while 44 and 36%, respectively, of those with OCD + DD group were classified as either Ds or U (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.0001). Different kinds of SoM reflecting insecure attachment differentiated the clinical groups studied, with OCD predominantly showing dismissing traits and depression attachment SoM commonly associated with severe adverse events. Such differences might play distinct roles in the pathogenic processes of the psychiatric disorders, or be the result of the cognitive states associated with OCD and DD.",
533,excluded,Assessing the effect of elevated carbon dioxide on soil carbon: a comparison of four meta-analyses,"Soil is the largest reservoir of organic carbon (C) in the terrestrial biosphere and soil C has a relatively long mean residence time. Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentrations generally increase plant growth and C input to soil, suggesting that soil might help mitigate atmospheric CO(2) rise and global warming. But to what extent mitigation will occur is unclear. The large size of the soil C pool not only makes it a potential buffer against rising atmospheric CO(2), but also makes it difficult to measure changes amid the existing background. Meta-analysis is one tool that can overcome the limited power of single studies. Four recent meta-analyses addressed this issue but reached somewhat different conclusions about the effect of elevated CO(2) on soil C accumulation, especially regarding the role of nitrogen (N) inputs. Here, we assess the extent of differences between these conclusions and propose a new analysis of the data. The four meta-analyses included different studies, derived different effect size estimates from common studies, used different weighting functions and metrics of effect size, and used different approaches to address nonindependence of effect sizes. Although all factors influenced the mean effect size estimates and subsequent inferences, the approach to independence had the largest influence. We recommend that meta-analysts critically assess and report choices about effect size metrics and weighting functions, and criteria for study selection and independence. Such decisions need to be justified carefully because they affect the basis for inference. Our new analysis, with a combined data set, confirms that the effect of elevated CO(2) on net soil C accumulation increases with the addition of N fertilizers. Although the effect at low N inputs was not significant, statistical power to detect biogeochemically important effect sizes at low N is limited, even with meta-analysis, suggesting the continued need for long-term experiments.",
534,excluded,Mood induction procedures: a critical review,"For a long period in the history of psychological, research, emotion and cognition have been studied independently, as if one were irrelevant to the other. The renewed interest of researchers for the study of the relations between cognition and emotion has led to the development of a range of laboratory methods for inducing temporary mood states. This paper aims to review the main mood induction procedures allowing the induction of a negative mood as well as a positive mood, developed since the pioneer study of Schachter and Singer [Psychol Rev 69 (1962) 379-399] and to account for the usefulness and problems related to the use of such techniques. The first part of this paper deals with the detailed presentation of some of the most popular mood induction procedures according to their type: simple (use of only one mood induction technique) or combined (association of two or more techniques at once). The earliest of the modern techniques is the Velten Mood Induction Procedure [Behav Res Ther 6 (1968) 473-482], which involves reading aloud sixty self-referent statements progressing from relative neutral mood to negative mood or dysphoria. Some researchers have varied the procedure slightly by changing the number of the statements [Behav Res Ther 21 (1983) 233-239, Br J Clin Psychol 21 (1982) 111-117, J Pers Soc Psychol 35 (1977) 625-636]. Various other mood induction procedures have been developed including music induction [Cogn Emotion 11 (1997) 403-432, Br J Med Psychol 55 (1982) 127-138], film clip induction [J Pers Soc Psychol 20 (1971) 37-43, Cogn Emotion 7 (1993) 171-193, Rottenberg J, Ray RR, Gross JJ. Emotion elicitation using films. In: Coan JA, Allen JJB, editors. The handbook of emotion elicitation and assessment. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007], autobiographical recall [J Clin Psychol 36 (1980) 215-226, Jallais C. Effets des humeurs positives et negatives sur les structures de connaissances de type script. These de doctorat non publiee. Universite de Nantes, Nantes] or combined inductions [Gilet AL. Etude des effets des humeurs positives et negatives sur l' organisation des connaissances en memoire semantique. These de doctorat non publiee, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, J Ment Imagery 19 (1995) 133-150]. In music or film clip inductions, subjects are asked to listen or view some mood-suggestive pieces of material determined by the experimenter according to standardized music or film sets [J Ment Imagery 19 (1995) 133-150, Cogn Emotion 7 (1993) 171-193] and selected to elicit target moods. According to many authors, these two mood induction procedures seem to be among the most effective manners to induce moods [Br J Psychol 85 (1994) 55-78, Eur J Soc Psychol 26 (1996) 557-580] in an individual or in a group setting [Jallais C. Effets des humeurs positives et negatives sur les structures de connaissances de type script. These de doctorat non publiee. Universite de Nantes, Nantes]. As it is believed that multiple inductions contribute additively to a mood [Am Psychol 36 (1981) 129-148], researchers proposed to combine two or more techniques at the same time. Thus, the Velten Mood Induction Procedure has been successively associated with the hypnosis mood induction procedure [J Pers Soc Psychol 42 (1982) 927-934], the music mood induction procedure [Behav Res Ther 21 (1983) 233-239, J Exp Soc Psychol 26 (1990) 465-480] or the imagination mood induction procedure [Br J Clin Psychol 21 (1982) 111-117]. Successful combinations of inductions usually use a first induction that occupies foreground attention and a second one tht contributes to congruent background atmosphere. One of the most successful combined mood induction procedures has been developed by Mayer, Allen and Beauregard [J Ment Imagery 19 (1995) 133-150]. This technique associates guided imagery with music and is supposed to increase effectiveness of the induction. In the second part of this paper the aim is to present the usefulness of mood induction procedures in the study of cognitive processes in depression [Clin Psychol Rev 25 (2005) 487-510], borderline personality disorder [J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry 36 (2005) 226-239] or associated with brain imaging [Am J Psychiatry 161 (2004) 2245-2256]. Then the inherent problems to the use of experimental mood induction procedures are reconsidered. Doubts have effectively arisen about the effectiveness and validity of the mood induction procedures usually used in research. Some authors questioned whether a sufficient intensity of mood is produced or the possibility that the effects observed are due mainly to demand effects [Br J Psychol 85 (1994) 55-78, Clin Psychol Rev 10 (1990) 669-697, Eur J Soc Psychol 26 (1996) 557-580]. In fact, the various mood induction procedures are not equal with regard to the demand effects observed. The question of demand characteristics with respect to mood induction procedures is still under debate, even if demand effects are supposed to be most likely to occur with self-statement techniques (especially with the Velten mood induction procedure) or when subjects are explicitly instructed to try to enter a specific mood state [Eur J Soc Psychol 26 (1996) 557-580]. Another interrogation relates to the effectiveness of these various procedures of induction and the duration of induced moods. Generally, the various techniques used produce true changes of moods in the majority if not the whole of the subjects. However, certain procedures seem more effective in inducing a mood in particular [Br J Psychol 85 (1994) 55-78, Clin Psychol Rev 10 (1990) 669-697, Eur J Soc Psychol 26 (1996) 557-580]. As for the duration of induced moods this depends at the same time on the procedure used and the mood induced. Nevertheless, mood induction remains fundamental in the study of the effects of mood on the cognitive activities, insofar as it makes it possible to study the effects of negative as well as positive moods.

535,excluded,Older adults' medication use 6 months before and after hip fracture: a population-based cohort study,"OBJECTIVES: To study changes in use of fall-risk increasing drugs (FRIDs) and bone density-related medication in participants with hip fracture before and after the fracture and to analyze differences between five healthcare districts. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Data retrieved from two national databases PARTICIPANTS: All 2,043 people with hip fracture aged 60 and older in a Swedish county in 2006. MEASUREMENTS: Changes in FRIDs and bone-active medications prescribed within 6 months before and 6 months after hip fracture and differences between health care districts. RESULTS: Before hip fracture, 1,308 participants (67.7%) received any FRIDs or combinations; after fracture, 97.7% were treated. Polypharmacy (>= 5 drugs) increased 39.3%, excessive polypharmacy (>= 10 drugs) increased 36.4%, and use of three or more psychotropic drugs increased 8.6%. After fracture, the use of all analyzed drugs including psychotropic, cardiovascular, opioid, and anticholinergic drugs increased significantly (P < . 001). Treatment with calcium and vitamin D increased from 9% before to 27.7% after and with bisphosphonates from 3.5% to 7.6%. Variations in postfracture prescribing between the five health care districts were observed regarding opioids (range 85-64%), bisphosphonates (range 20-4%), and calcium and vitamin D (72-13%) (P < .001, for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of participants with hip fracture were prescribed FRIDs before fracture, and the number increased significantly after fracture. Significant variations between healthcare districts in treating osteoporosis and pain were evident; geriatric support could be a contributing factor to the greater treatment in two districts.

536,excluded,The relationship between fas and fas ligand gene polymorphism and preeclampsia risk,"Preeclampsia is an idiopathic multisystem disorder with partial genetic and immunological etiology. Several studies investigated the association between various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) genes and the risk of preeclampsia. However, they achieved inconsistent results. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis by systematically searching the Cochrane Library, PubMed and Embase databases and assessed this association by calculating pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence interval to reach a more trustworthy conclusion. Subgroup analyses by genotype methods and source of controls (SOC) were also conducted. Seven citations containing nine studies were included for four SNPs (Fas -670 A/G, FasL 124A/G, FasL -844C/T, Fas -1377 G/A) in this meta-analysis. Our data suggested the G allele and genotype GG of the Fas -670 A/G polymorphism, GG genotype of the FasL 124A/G polymorphism, and TT genotype of the FasL -844C/T polymorphism increased the risk of preeclampsia. Stratification analyses by genotype methods and SOC also indicated that Fas -670 A/G polymorphism was related to increased risk for preeclampsia. In conclusion, Fas and FasL gene polymorphisms play important roles in the development of preeclampsia. Further well-designed studies in other races are needed to confirm the findings of this meta-analysis.",
537,included,Changes in soil organic carbon stocks as affected by cropping systems and cropping duration in China's paddy fields: a meta-analysis,"Great uncertainties remain in the impact of cropping systems on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in paddy fields that hold a large potential for carbon (C) sequestration. In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to examine trends on SOC stocks in unfertilized and fertilized fields from three of the most common rice cropping systems in China. Results showed that rice cropping without any nutrient application (Control) significantly increased SOC stocks by 9% compared to the initial level in double rice cropping systems (DR), whereas no significant effects were observed in single rice cropping systems (SR) and rice-upland crop rotation systems (RU). Paddy soils sequestered C in all the three cropping systems under inorganic NPK fertilization, and the magnitude of the increase in SOC stocks was in the order DR > RU > SR. Soil C stocks increased with the increasing cropping duration. Continuous rice cropping for more than 20 years led to average SOC gains of 15% and 23% in the control and NPK treatments, respectively. Furthermore, it seems that C sequestration was still occurring in the longest fields from the included studies. Thus, no SOC saturation trend was found over the investigated cropping duration. However, the negative relationship between SOC changes and their initial C stocks suggests indirectly the possibility of SOC saturation in paddy fields.",C sequestration; Crop rotation system; Cropping systems; Meta-analysis; NPK fertilization; Paddy fields; Paddy soils; Rice cropping systems; Soil organic carbon; Agriculture; Soils; carbon sequestration; cropping practice; fertilizer application; paddy field; rice; soil carbon; soil organic matter; China
538,excluded,Emergence of gentamicin-resistant bacteremia in hemodialysis patients receiving gentamicin lock catheter prophylaxis,"Background and objectives: Antibiotic locks in catheter-dependent chronic hemodialysis patients reduce the rate of catheter-related blood stream infections (CRIs), but there are no data regarding the long-term consequences of this practice. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: Over a 4-year period, from October 1, 2002, to September 30, 2006, we initiated a gentamicin and heparin lock (GHL) protocol in 1410 chronic hemodialysis patients receiving dialysis through a tunneled catheter in eight outpatient units. Results: Within the first year of the GHL protocol, our CRI rate decreased from 17 to 0.83 events per 1000 catheter-days. Beginning 6 months after initiation of the GHL protocol, febrile episodes occurred in 13 patients with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia resistant to gentamicin. Over the 4 years of GHL use, an additional 10 patients developed 11 episodes of gentamicin-resistant CRI (including 7 with Enterococcus faecalis), in which there were 4 deaths, 2 cases of septic shock requiring intensive care unit admission, and 4 cases of endocarditis. Because of these events, the GHL protocol was discontinued at the end of 2006. Conclusions: Although the use of GHL effectively lowered the CRI rate in our dialysis population, gentamicin-resistant CRIs emerged within 6 months. Gentamicin-resistant infections are a serious complication of the long-term use of GHLs. Alternative nonantibiotic catheter locks may be preferable to decrease the incidence of CRIs without inducing resistant pathogens.

539,excluded,The response patterns of arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal symbionts under elevated co2: a meta-analysis,"Elevated carbon dioxide (eCO(2)), a much-discussed topic in global warming, influences development and functions of mycorrhizal fungi and plants. However, due to the inconsistent results reported in various publications, the response patterns of symbionts associated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi to eCO(2) remains still unclear. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to identify how eCO(2) affected mycorrhizal fungi and if there is a significant different response between AM and ECM symbionts. Our results demonstrated that eCO(2) increased mycorrhizal plants biomass (+26.20%), nutrient contents [+2.45% in nitrogen (N), and +10.66% in phosphorus (P)] and mycorrhizal fungal growth (+22.87% in extraradical hyphal length and +21.77% in mycorrhizal fungal biomass), whereas plant nutrient concentrations decreased (-11.86% in N and -12.01% in P) because the increase in plant biomass was greater than that in nutrient content. The AM plants exhibited larger increases in their biomass (+33.90%) and in their N (+21.99%) and P contents (+19.48%) than did the ECM plants (+20.57% in biomass, -4.28% in N content and -13.35% in P content). However, ECM fungi demonstrated increased responses of mycorrhizal fungal biomass (+29.98%) under eCO(2) compared with AM fungi (+6.61%). These data indicate different patterns in the growth of AM and ECM symbionts under eCO(2): AM symbionts contributed more to plant growth, while ECM symbionts were more favorable to mycorrhizal fungal growth. In addition, the responses of plant biomass to eCO(2) showed no significant difference between short-term and long-term groups, whereas a significant difference in the responses of mycorrhizal fungal growth was found between the two groups. The addition of N increased plant growth but decreased mycorrhizal fungal abundance, and P addition increased total plant biomass and extraradical hyphal length, but shoot biomass largely increased in low P conditions. Mixtures of mycorrhizal fungi affected the total plant and root biomasses more than a single mycorrhizal fungus. Clarifying the different patterns in AM and ECM symbionts under eCO(2) would contribute to a better understanding of the interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and plant symbionts under the conditions of global climate change as well as of the coevolution of flora with Earth's environment.",mycorrhizal fungi-plant symbiont; eCO(2) fertilization effect; experimental duration; fertilization; global climate change
540,included,Elevated CO2 stimulates net accumulations of carbon and nitrogen in land ecosystems: A meta-analysis,"The capability of terrestrial ecosystems to sequester carbon (C) plays a critical role in regulating future climatic change yet depends on nitrogen (N) availability. To predict long-term ecosystem C storage, it is essential to examine whether soil N becomes progressively limiting as C and N are sequestered in long-lived plant biomass and soil organic matter. A critical parameter to indicate the long-term progressive N limitation (PNL) is net change in ecosystem N content in association with C accumulation in plant and soil pools under elevated CO, We compiled data from 104 published papers that study C and N dynamics at ambient and elevated CO2, The compiled database contains C contents, N contents, and C:N ratio in various plant and soil pools, and root:shoot ratio. Averaged C and N pool sizes in plant and soil all significantly increase at elevated CO2 in comparison to those at ambient CO2, ranging from a 5% increase in shoot N content to a 32% increase in root C content. The C and N contents in litter pools are consistently higher in elevated than ambient CO2 among all the surveyed studies whereas C and N contents in the other pools increase in some studies and decrease in other studies. The high variability in CO, induced changes in C and N pool sizes results from diverse responses of various C and N processes to elevated CO2. Averaged C:N ratios are higher by 3% in litter and soil pools and 11% in root and shoot pools at elevated relative to ambient CO2 Elevated CO2 slightly increases root:shoot ratio. The net N accumulation in plant and soil pools at least helps prevent complete down-regulation of, and likely supports, long-term CO2 stimulation of C sequestration. The concomitant C and N accumulations in response to rising atmospheric CO2 may reflect intrinsic nature of ecosystem development as revealed before by studies of succession over hundreds to millions of years.",carbon sequestration; ecosystem development; global change; meta-analysis; nitrogen; stoichiometry

Demographic analysis by regions in japan,"We reported a remarkable regional difference within Japan in the incidence of end-stage renal disease. Regional differences were also well-known for salt intake, blood pressure (BP), and mortality from stroke, which remains one of the leading causes of death. Noting these regional differences, we examined mutual relationships among salt intake, BP, and stroke mortality in 12 regions of Japan. Data of salt intake, BP, and stroke mortality in 12 regions were collected from National Nutrition Survey (NNS-J), reanalysis of NNS-J, and Vital Statistics of National Population Dynamic Survey (Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare), respectively. Significant regional differences were found in salt intake (P < .0001), mean arterial BP (P = .0001), and stroke mortality (P <.0001). Although annual changes in these parameters were also significant, their regional differences persisted. Salt intake had positive relationships with both mean arterial BP (r = 0.26, P = .0009) and stroke mortality (r = 0.26, P < .0001) across 12 regions, whereas mean arterial BP was not correlated with stroke mortality. Multiple regression analysis further identified salt intake as an independent factor to increase stroke mortality, but mean arterial BP was not a determinant. Compared with the four regions with lowest salt intake, odds ratios of stroke mortality adjusted by mean arterial BP were 1.04 (95% CI, 1.03-1.06) for the intermediate four regions and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.23-1.27) for the four regions with highest salt intake. These findings suggest that salt intake may have an adverse effect on stroke mortality independently of BP. J Am Soc Hypertens 2011;5(6):456-462. (C) 2011 American Society of Hypertension.

542,excluded,Response and driving factors of soil microbial diversity related to global nitrogen addition,"It is increasingly evident that soil microorganisms play a substantial role in ecosystem processes, which occupy a large part of genetic diversity in terrestrial ecosystems. During the past decades, nitrogen (N) addition induced by human has been regarded as the main driver of global changes to soil microecological processes. Although growing studies demonstrated the loss of biodiversity due to N addition in regional scale, the role of global N addition on soil microbial diversity is lacking. Here, we sought to illuminate the impacts and driving factors of soil microbial diversity in relation to global N addition using a meta-analysis from 1,078 paired observations in 212 studies. We found a negative influence of global N addition on soil microbial diversity, and the reduction of soil microbial diversity was determined by land use types, N fertility types, methods, N addition rates, and duration. In fact, there was a linear decrease of soil microbial diversity along the latitudinal gradient, and N addition-induced acidification was the predominant contributor to the reduction of soil microbial diversity. Both of soil properties (pH, soil organic carbon, soil total N, and soil microbial biomass C) and climatic factors (mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation) determined soil microbial diversity under global N addition. It was noted that soil fungal diversity was more adaptable to acidic environments, whereas soil bacterial diversity was more adaptable to neutral environment. Most importantly, soil fungal diversity was more sensitive than soil bacterial diversity under global N addition. Our meta-analysis provides a new insight in understanding the key role of global N addition in shaping soil microbial diversity. Thereby, we recommend that future research should be focused on the soil microbial processes using manipulative controlled experiments, which identify the available measures to reduce the loss of soil microbial diversity globally.",Chao1 index; global; N addition; Shannon index; soil microorganisms
543,excluded,Factors affecting agricultural nitrogen removal in riparian strips: examples from groundwater-dependent ecosystems of the po valley (northern ita,"The role of riparian ecosystems in mitigating the effects of diffuse agricultural sources is recognized in several regulatory measures and public policy initiatives in many parts of the world. This study aimed to evaluate the N buffering capacity of semi-natural riparian zones associated with spring-fed lowland streams, also known as ""fontanili"", representing the most important groundwater-dependent ecosystems in Northern Italy. Monitoring parcels were set up in nine riparian sites selected to cover a range of different soil properties and hydrogeological settings, and to sustain the evaluation of the main drivers affecting their N removal efficiency. Subsurface water level, nutrient concentrations and the main hydro-chemical parameters were monitored along transects of piezometers installed from crop fields to the spring channels. On selected samples from two sites stable isotopes of the water molecule were also determined. Median NO3- input concentrations from adjacent cropland to the riparian sites ranged from 0.10 to 21 mg NL-1, with maximum values exceeding the drinking water limit recorded during the summer and winter fertilization periods. Highly variable groundwater nitrate patterns were found in the riparian areas, including short nitrate plumes extending from the adjacent cropland into some riparian zones, or in others, small patches where NO3- declined at variable distance from the stream. Some chemical indicators (e.g., NO3-/Cl- ratio, O-2, DOC) suggested that NO3- attenuation was mostly due to the denitrifying activity occurring in the subsurface aquifers in specific conditions (hot spots and moments), although, in some cases, physical processes such as dilution also contributed. The overall N removal efficiency was greater than 90% in four sites, 74%, 34% and 30% in three sites, and zero in the remaining two sites. Useful predictors of the nitrate removal capacity were factors linked to the water residence time, such as the hydraulic conductivity, the soil texture and the slope of the riparian profile, together with the water table depth and soil organic carbon. A combination by standardized averaging of these five factors supported a clear discrimination of sites with zero or low N removal effectiveness from those with high efficiency.

544,excluded,Lupus nephritis: induction therapy in severe lupus nephritis-should mmf be considered the drug of choice?,"Severe lupus nephritis is an aggressive disease that requires an aggressive approach to treatment. Recent randomized clinical trials showed that mycophenolate mofetil compared favorably with cyclophosphamide (traditional approach) for remission induction. Consequently, mycophenolate mofetil is now commonly recommended as first-line therapy. Nevertheless, the role of mycophenolate mofetil in treating severe lupus nephritis is unclear, because such patients were excluded from these trials. With this limitation as background, this work addresses the question of mycophenolate mofetil for induction therapy for severe lupus nephritis. We performed a systematic review of the outcomes of treating severe lupus nephritis with mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide. Because no studies directly addressed this question, these data were extracted from the published literature or obtained by personal communications from investigators. There is no universally accepted definition, and therefore, severe lupus nephritis was arbitrarily defined by renal histology, resistance to therapy, or level of kidney function at presentation. For each trial analyzed, we determined the partial and complete remission rates. Long-term outcomes were compared when available. The pooled results suggest that mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide are equally effective in inducing remission of severe lupus nephritis. However, relapse rates and risk of developing ESRD were higher for mycophenolate mofetil compared with cyclophosphamide. In conclusion, in the short term, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide are about equal in inducing remission. However, long-term outcomes suggest better preservation of kidney function and fewer relapses with cyclophosphamide therapy. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil should not yet be considered the induction drug of choice for severe lupus nephritis. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 8: 147-153, 2013. doi: 10.2215/CJN.03290412",
545,included,Ecosystem service delivery of agri-environment measures: A synthesis for hedgerows and grass strips on arable land,"In north western Europe, agricultural systems are generally managed to maximize the potential delivery of provisioning ecosystem services. This has often been at the expense of other ecosystem services. Because the current supply of most ecosystem services is insufficient to meet the increasing demand, particular attention to ecosystem service delivery and hence multifunctionality in agriculture is vital. In this paper, we quantitatively assessed the impact of hedgerows and grass strips bordering parcels with annual arable crops on the simultaneous delivery of a set of ecosystem services and from there we identified synergies and trade-offs on virtual parcels. After a systematic literature search, mixed models were applied on observations from 60 studies and quantitative effect relationships between ecosystem service delivery and hedgerow and grass strip characteristics were developed. Next to the hedgerow, until a distance of twice the hedgerow height, arable crop yield was reduced by 29%. Beyond this' distance, until 20 times the hedgerow height, crop yield was increased by 6%. Compared to a similar arable parcel without hedgerow or grass strip, soil carbon stock was 22% higher in the hedgerow, on average 6% higher in the adjacent parcel next to the hedgerow and 37% higher in the upper 30 cm soil layer in the grass strip. Both hedgerows and grass strips intercepted nitrogen from the surface (69% and 67%, respectively) and subsurface (34% and 32%, respectively) flow and phosphorus (67% and 73%, respectively) and soil sediment (91% and 90%, respectively) from the surface flow. More natural predator species were found on parcels with hedgerows, but the number of predators was unaffected. On parcels with grass strips, both predator density and diversity was higher and aphid density was reduced. Our calculations on parcel level indicate that the trade-off between arable crop yield and regulating ecosystem services depends on hedgerow width and height and parcel dimensions. A similar trade-off is found on parcels with grass strips, but increasing grass strip width results in a proportionally higher delivery of regulating ecosystem services.",Agro-ecology; Agro-ecosystem; Field margins; Multifunctionality; Systematic review; Trade-offs
546,excluded,Full-inversion tillage and organic carbon distribution in soil profiles: A meta-analysis,"While the adoption of no-till (NT) usually leads to the accumulation of soil organic C (SOC) in the surface soil layers, a number Of Studies have shown that this effect is sometimes partly or completely offset by greater SOC content near the bottom of the plow layer under full-inversion tillage (FIT). Our purpose was to review the literature in which SOC profiles have been measured under paired NT and FIT situations. Only replicated and randomized studies directly comparing NT and FIT for >5 yr were considered. Profiles of SOC had to be measured to at least 30 cm. As expected, in most studies SOC content was significantly greater (P < 0.05) under,NT than FIT in the surface soil layers. At the 21- to 25-cm soil depth, however, which corresponds to the mean plowing depth for the data set (23 cm), the average SOC content was significantly greater under FIT than NT Moreover, under FIT, greater SOC content was observed just below the average depth of plowing (26-35 cm). On average, there was 4.9 Mg ha(-1) more SOC under NT than FIT (P = 0.03). Overall, this difference in favor of NT increased significantly but weakly with the duration of the experiment (R-2 = 0.15, P = 0.05). The relative accumulation of SOC at depth under FIT Could not be related to soil or climatic variables. Furthermore, the organic matter accumulating at depth under FIT appeared to be present in relatively stable form, but this hypothesis and the mechanisms involved require further investigation.",Agricultural machinery; Organic carbon; Windows operating system; Meta-analysis; No-till; Soil organic C; Surface soil layers; Programmable logic controllers; soil depth; soil profile; spatial distribution; tillage
547,excluded,Executive function in treatment-resistant depression before and after electroconvulsive therapy,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine executive functions (EF) in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) before and after bitemporal electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and to evaluate possible associations between the depression severity and executive tasks performances. Methods: Patients (n = 29), treated with bitemporal ECT, underwent assessment at three time points: baseline, immediately after ECT course and 1 month later. The Stockings of Cambridge (SOC, CANTAB) was used to assess EF: (1) number of problems solved in minimum moves (SOCP), (2) initial thinking time (SOC-I) and (3) subsequent thinking time (SOC-T). Results: The scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression scale were significantly reduced over time, with no negative effects on the EF. Among SOC subtests, only SOC-I improved over time, which was significantly correlated with the depressive symptoms reduction. SOC-T and SOC-P remained unchanged and did not correlate with mood. Interestingly, the patients with more lifetime psychiatric hospitalisations and more ECT applications were more likely to drop-out and to have longer SOC-T while performing the test. Conclusions: Our results support the view that ECT does not produce long-lasting EF deficits, nor exacerbates the pre-existing ones. The improvement of the EF performances during and after the ECT-induced alleviation of mood symptoms in TRD is based mostly on the reduction of time needed to plan the problem solution.",Executive functions; major depression; ECT; CANTAB; The Stockings of Cambridge task
548,excluded,Selective optimization with compensation (soc) competencies in depression,"Background: The metamodel of selective optimization with compensation (SOC) aims to integrate scientific knowledge about the nature of development and aging with a focus on successful adaptation. For the first time the present study examines how SOC competencies and depressive symptoms are associated. In particular, potential state or trait effects of SOC competencies are considered. Methods: Fifty-three patients (31 women and 22 men), aged 21 to 73 years, suffering from depression, were interviewed twice during inpatient treatment, first on admission to hospital and later during remission or on discharge, to assess the severity of depression and differences in the SOC competencies using standardized scales. For comparison purpose, data from a population based survey in Germany were used. Results: The SOC scores in the first interview were significantly lower than those of the comparison collective (p<0.0001), but in remission there was no significant difference left. Younger and older patients showed no significant difference in their SOC competencies, neither regarding the severity of depressive symptoms on admission to the hospital, nor during remission. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that the SOC ability is dynamic and mood dependent (state effect). Otherwise, there is no hint of life-long reduced SOC competencies or a trait effect which would be associated with an increased vulnerability to the development of a depressive disorder. Regarding the high prevalence of depression especially in the elderly and physically ill patients, (gerontological) studies on SOC competencies should take depression into account.

549,excluded,Sense of coherence in young people with congenital heart disease,"Objective: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have been found to play a role in the development of clinical complications. Hence, it is crucial to understand why some patients do well in terms of PROs and others do not and to identify these groups of patients. Sense of coherence (SOC), capturing a person's outlook on life, is associated with PROs in adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD). Therefore, we (1) examine how SOC develops in young people with CHD, (2) identify subgroups of SOC development, and (3) characterize subgroups in terms of demographic and clinical variables and PROs. Method: In this 4-wave longitudinal study, 429 adolescents with CHD (53.4% boys; median age = 16.3 years) completed assessments of SOC (SOC-13). PROs included quality of life (linear analog scale), loneliness (UCLA-8), depression (CES-D), and perceived health (PedsQL). Latent class growth analysis was used to identify clinically meaningful subgroups of SOC development. Results: Patients with CHD had a moderate SOC that slightly decreased over the first 18 months. Four subgroups of SOC development emerged: Consistently High (27%), Intermediate Stable (41%), Intermediate Decreasing (25%), and Chronically Low (7%). Subgroups differed in terms of sex and PROs, but not in terms of age, disease complexity, primary diagnosis, or surgical history. Conclusion: Patients with a strong and stable SOC over time showed a better adaptation than patients with a lower and/or decreasing SOC. Our results can guide the identification of patients at risk for adverse health outcomes and the development of interventions to enhance optimal living in patients with CHD.",
550,included,Changes in microbial biomass and the metabolic quotient with biochar addition to agricultural soils: A Meta-analysis,"Biochar has been increasingly recommended for world agriculture, but the effects on microbial activities in agricultural soils has not yet thoroughly assessed. In this study, using a meta analysis of experiment data retrieved from literature published up to March 1, 2015, changes were examined in microbial biomass and soil respiration in agricultural soils with biochar addition. Microbial responses to biochar addition were quantified in soil respiration quotient (RQ), microbial quotient (MQ) and metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) and their differences were evaluated between with and without biochar addition, and among groups of biochar production conditions and experiment conditions. There was an overall increase by 25% in soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) and nitrogen (SMBN) but a decrease by 13% in qCO(2), under biochar compared to the control. Whereas, microbial biomass carbon was increased by 26% but total soil CO2 production unchanged, across all short term experiments up to 6 months following a single biochar addition. A significant reduction (by <20%) in qCO(2) was found under crop residue and manure biochars in term of feedstock, and biochars pyrolyzed at high temperature over 500 degrees C in term of pyrolysis temperature. Whereas, the reduction was great (by over 30%) both in clay soils and in neutral soils but moderate (by 15%) in soil organic carbon (SOC) depleted soils, respectively in terms of soil texture, reaction and SOC level. Thus, soil conditions exerted great impacts on microbial metabolic quotient changes compared to biochar conditions. Nevertheless, microbial responses to biochar addition to agricultural soils were much uncertain with respect to both biochar and experiment conditions. Long term field experiments are still deserved to monitor soil microbial processes as long as sustainable soil managements are concerned with biochar technology in agriculture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

551,excluded,Meta-analysis of soil mercury accumulation by vegetables,"Mercury pollution in soil poses serious risks to human health through consumption of contaminated vegetables. We used a meta-analysis to examine the mercury enrichment ability of different vegetables and the main factors affecting mercury uptake. We drew the following conclusions. (1) Plants with a lower bioconcentration factor (BCF) include cowpea, long bean, and radish, whereas plants with a higher BCF include green pepper, spinach, cabbage, and Chinese cabbage. (2) Leaf and cucurbit have the highest and lowest capacity, respectively, for mercury enrichment. (3) When soil pH is < 6.5, mercury level uptake by the plant increases, whereas it decreases when the pH is > 7.5, meaning that increased soil pH reduces mercury uptake in soil. (4) When soil organic matter (SOM) is lower than 20 g/kg, tuber plants have the highest and eggplant has the lowest mercury adsorption capacity, respectively. When SOM is 20-30 g/kg, cucurbit has the lowest and leaf the highest adsorption capacity, respectively. When SOM is higher than 30 g/kg, however, eggplant has the highest mercury adsorption capacity, but there were no significant differences among the five types of vegetables. We argue that this meta-analysis aids in selecting vegetables suitable for absorption of heavy metals from polluted soil.",
552,excluded,Evidence map of crop diversification strategies at the global scale,"The diversification of cropping systems encompasses different strategies that may help maintain or enhance the sustainability of agriculture. Thousands of experiments have been carried out around the world since almost five decades to evaluate and compare the performances of various diversification strategies in a wide array of agroecosystems and climates. Although these analyses have been synthesized in a growing number of meta-analyses, the information remains somewhat fragmented. A multicriteria systematic synthesis of worldwide agricultural diversification is still lacking. Here, we review all meta-analyses conducted on crop diversification strategies and produce a detailed overview of their results and of their quality. We identified and analyzed 99 meta-analyses summarizing the results of more than 3700 agronomic experiments on seven crop diversification strategies. Among these strategies, rotation and associated plant species are dominant in the literature followed by intercropping, agroforestry and landscape heterogeneity. Our analysis reveals that rotation and intercropping are associated with yield increases. Agroforestry systematically induces an improvement of biodiversity and soil quality?in particular soil organic carbon. We show that, regardless of the context, a combination of several diversification strategies outperforms any individual strategy. Our review reveals that a significant knowledge gap remains, in particular regarding water use, farmers? profitability, product quality and production stability. Few meta-analyses investigate the performance of landscape heterogeneity and of systems with species other than cereals and pulses. Additionally, we show that most of the meta-analyses studied cannot be considered fully transparent and reproducible. Their conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution. Our systematic mapping provides a benchmark to guide and improve the relevance and reliability of future meta-analyses in agronomy.",agroforestry; cover crop; intercropping; rotation; variety mixture; systematic review; meta-analysis
553,excluded,Debate from the 2012 ash annual scientific sessions: should blood pressure be reduced in hemodialysis patients? Pro position,"Among chronic hemodialysis patients with hypertension, blood pressure should be lowered. Blood pressure reduction with antihypertensive drugs does not increase mortality; in contrast, meta-analysis of randomized trials suggests that treatment of hypertension in this high-risk population may, in fact, improve cardiovascular outcomes. The association of low blood pressure with increased mortality in longitudinal studies should not be considered as evidence against lowering blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure among hypertensive patients should primarily be done by sodium restriction and dry-weight reduction. Treatment is perhaps better directed to home blood pressure than pre- or post-dialysis blood pressure recordings. Although no firm data are available, it appears that treating home blood pressure to < 140/90 mm Hg appears reasonable. Nonetheless, all blood pressure recordings during dialysis are important to ensure patient safety. Adequately designed and powered randomized trials are needed to examine the notion that blood pressure lowering and, if so, to what level of blood pressure will improve clinically meaningful outcomes among chronic dialysis patients.

554,excluded,Differences in fertilization impacts on organic carbon content and stability in a paddy and an upland soil in subtropical china,"The stability of soil organic carbon (SOC) is of great importance in controlling long-term carbon (C) sequestration and feedbacks of soil C pools to climate change. It has been well documented that rice cropping and organic amendments could enhance SOC stocks, while the stability of the sequestered C has not been well understood yet. The objective of this study was to examine the difference in SOC content and stability between a paddy and an upland field under long-term fertilization and to explore the potential link between SOC chemical and biological stability. Soils were collected from two adjacent long-term paddy (annually double-rice cropping) and upland (annually double-corn cropping) experiments with the same soil parent material, where different fertilization regimes were initiated in 1981 and 1986, respectively. The chemical and biological stability of SOC were measured by acid hydrolysis and aerobic incubations, respectively. The C concentration was significantly higher in the paddy soil than in the upland soil, regardless of fertilization regimes. As compared to the initial level, long-term rice cropping without any fertilization (CK) significantly enhanced SOC concentration, whereas corn cropping led to a slight decline. Manure amendments combined with inorganic NPK fertilizers (NPKM) significantly increased SOC content relative to the inorganic NPK application alone treatment (NPK) in both the upland and paddy fields. The paddy soil had significantly greater cumulative C released per gram of soil C (i.e., the biological stability of SOC) than the upland soil. Cumulative C released per gram of soil C was significantly higher in NPKM than in NPK in both the paddy and upland soils, whereas no significant difference was observed between the CK and NPK treatments. Acid hydrolysis could reveal the difference in C stability between the paddy and upland soils, but could not characterize the effect of fertilization. Rice cropping facilitates SOC accumulation relative to upland cropping, whereas the inherent SOC stability is lower under the former than the latter in the site. The lower SOC turnover in the paddy than in the upland is mainly due to anaerobic conditions. Organic amendments significantly enhance SOC, but reduce its stability in both the paddy and upland fields. The sensitivity of acid hydrolysis is relatively low in determining SOC stability.",Soil organic carbon; Carbon sequestration; Long-termexperiment; Rice; Corn; Chemical and biological stability
555,excluded,Emotional congruence with children and sexual offending against children: a meta-analytic review,"Objective: Emotional congruence with children is an exaggerated affective and cognitive affiliation with children that is posited to be involved in the initiation and maintenance of sexual offending against children. The current meta-analysis examined the relationship between emotional congruence with children and sexual offending against children, sexual recidivism, and change following sexual offender treatment. Method: A systematic literature review of online academic databases, conference proceedings, governmental agency websites, and article, book chapter, and book reference lists was performed. Thirty studies on emotional congruence with children in sexual offenders against children (SOC) were included in a random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Extrafamilial SOC-especially those with male victims-evidenced higher emotional congruence with children than most non-SOC comparison groups and intrafamilial SOC. In contrast, intrafamilial SOC evidenced less emotional congruence with children than many of the non-SOC comparison groups. Higher levels of emotional congruence with children were associated with moderately higher rates of sexual recidivism. The association between emotional congruence with children and sexual recidivism was significantly stronger in extrafamilial SOC samples (d = 0.58, 95% CI [0.31, 0.85]) compared with intrafamilial SOC samples (d = -0.15, 95% CI [-0.58, 0.27]). Similarly, emotional congruence with children showed a significant reduction from pre- to posttreatment for extrafamilial SOC (d = 0.41, 95% Cl [0.33, 0.85]), but not for intrafamilial SOC (d = 0.06, 95% CI [-0.10, 0.22]). Conclusions: Emotional congruence with children is a characteristic of extrafamilial SOC, is moderately predictive of sexual recidivism, and is potentially amenable through treatment efforts.",

We aimed to determine the effect of two new potential interventions for TB contact tracing programmes: Point of Care CD4 (PoC CD4) on HIV linkage to care and household Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) provision on uptake and retention of IPT. Methods A pragmatic, three-arm, cluster-randomized trial was undertaken. TB Household contacts were randomised to 3 arms: 1) Standard of Care TB and HIV testing (SOC); 2) SOC with POC CD4 for those testing HIV positive; 3) SOC with POC CD4 and IPT for eligible household members. Linkage to care within 90 days was assessed either through patient visits (at 10 weeks and 6 months) or via telephonic contact. Results 2,243 index TB patients and 3,012 contacts (64,3% female, median age 30 years) were enrolled. On self-report, 26(1.2%) were currently receiving TB treatment and 1816 (60.3%) reported a prior HIV test. HIV testing uptake was 34.7% in the SoC arm, 40.2% in the PoC CD4 arm (RR1.16, CI 0.99 +/- 1.36, p-value = 0.060) and 39.9% in the PoC CD4 + HH-IPT arm (RR = 1.15, CI 0.99 +/- 1.35, p-value = 0.075). Linkage to care within 3 months was 30.8% in the SoC arm and 42.1% in the POC CD4 arms (RR 1.37; CI: 0.68 +/- 2.76, p-value = 0.382). 20/ 21 contacts (95.2%) initiated IPT in the PoC CD4 + HH-IPT arm, compared to 3/20 (15.0%) in the PoC CD4 arm (p = 0.004; p-value from Fisher's exact test < 0.001). Among 3,008 contacts screened for tuberculosis, 15 (3.4%) had bacteriologically confirmed TB with an overall yield of TB of 0.5% (95% CI: 0.3%, 0.8%). Conclusions Household PoC CD4 testing and IPT initiation is feasible. There was only weak evidence that PoCCD4 led to a small increase in HCT uptake and no evidence for an increase in link-age-to-care. IPT initiation and completion was increased by the household intervention. Although feasible, these interventions had low impact due to the low uptake of HIV testing in households.",
557,excluded,"Impacts of vegetation restoration strategies on soil organic carbon and nitrogen dynamics in a karst area, southwest china","Soil carbon (C) sequestration through cropland conversion has been regarded as a major strategy to absorb atmospheric CO2 and thus mitigate global warming, but much uncertainty still exists in terms of restoration strategies. In this study, soil C and nitrogen (N) were measured 13 years after cropland conversion in a karst area, southwest China. Four restoration strategies were included, i.e., (i) restoration with an economic tree species Toona sinensis (TS), (ii) restoration with Guimu-1 hybrid elephant grass (GG), (iii) restoration with a combination of Zenia insignis and Guimu-1 hybrid elephant grass (ZG), and iv) spontaneous regeneration (SR). Cropland under maize-soybean rotation (CR) was used as reference and the space-for-time substitution approach was adopted to evaluate soil C and N stock (0-15 cm) change. Soil C stocks in TS and SR were elevated by 40% and 50%, respectively, relative to CR, while those in GG and ZG were not significantly changed. Soil N stocks in GG were not significantly changed, but stocks in TS, ZG and SR were enhanced by 130%, 81% and 117%, respectively, relative to CR. Significant correlation was found between soil C and N stock changes with rate of relative N stock change greater than that of C stock change. Similar to soil N stock, nitrate concentration, net nitrification rate and 615N values in TS, ZG and SR were greater than those in GG or CR. Stepwise multiple linear regression indicated that exchangeable calcium was the soil variable mainly responsible for the dynamics of both soil C and N. Our results indicate that plantation with economic tree species and spontaneous regeneration are likely equally effective in soil C sequestration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Globally, they cover approximately 1 billion hectares of land and contribute to the livelihoods of over 900 million people. Agroforestry systems have the capacity to sequester large quantities of carbon (C) in both soil and biomass. However, these systems have not yet been fully considered in the approach to C accounting developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, largely due to the high diversity of agroforestry systems and scarcity of relevant data. Our literature review identified a total of 72 scientific, peer-reviewed articles associated with biomass C storage (50) and with soil organic carbon (SOC) (122), containing a total of 542 observations (324 and 218, respectively). Based on a synthesis of the reported observations, we are presenting a set of Tier 1 coefficients for biomass C storage for each of the eight main agroforestry systems identified, including alley cropping, fallows, hedgerows, multistrata, parklands, shaded perennial-crop, silvoarable and silvopastoral systems, disaggregated by climate and region. Using the same agroforestry classification, we are presenting a set of stock change factors (F LU ) and SOC accumulation/loss rates for three main land use changes (LUCs): cropland to agroforestry; forest to agroforestry; and grassland to agroforestry. Globally, the mean SOC stock change factors (± confidence intervals) were estimated to be 1.25 ± 0.04, 0.89 ± 0.07, and 1.19 ± 0.10, for the three main LUCs, respectively. However, these average coefficients hide huge disparities across and within different climates, regions, and types of agroforestry systems, highlighting the necessity to adopt the more disaggregated coefficients provided herein. We encourage national governments to synthesize data from local field experiments to generate country-specific factors for more robust estimation of biomass and SOC storage.",carbon sequestration; emission factor; climate change mitigation; land; use change
559,excluded,Extractable and dissolved soil organic nitrogen - a quantitative assessment,"Extractable Organic N (EON) or Dissolved Organic Nitrogen (DON) pools are often analyzed to predict N mineralisation, N leaching, and to evaluate agricultural (nutrient) management practices. Size and characteristics of both pools, however, are strongly influenced by methodology. Quantifying the influence of methodology can increase the accuracy of soil tests to predict N mineralisation, improve model simulations, and can help to quantify the contribution of the EON and DON pools to soil N cycling. We estimated the relative impact of methodological, management, and environmental factors on EON and DON, using a meta-analysis approach based on 127 studies. Our results indicate that the EON and DON pools are neither similar in size nor controlled by the same factors. The influence of factors controlling EON generally decreased in the order of methodology (Delta 10-2400%), followed by environment (Delta 11-270%) and management (Delta 16-77%). DON concentrations were primarily controlled by management factors: different land use and fertilisation caused a variation of 37-118%. Seasonal variations in DON concentrations were generally smaller than variations in EON, suggesting that high mineralisation and sorption rates buffer DON. The large range in EON as affected by different methodology emphasizes the importance of using appropriate and standardized methods for the determination of EON. The determination of DON can be useful to estimate leaching losses. EON, however, can be used to assess the impact of soil management practices on the turnover rate of labile soil organic matter pools. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

We compiled data of 1,160 observations from 52 individual studies and conducted a meta--analysis of N addition effects on 18 variables related to C chemical compositions in terrestrial ecosystems. Results showed that plant lignin (+7.13%), plant protein (+25.94%), and soil lignin (+7.30%) were significantly increased by N addition, and plant hemicellulose (-4.39%) was significantly decreased, whereas plant fiber, plant cellulose, plant non-structural carbohydrate (NSC), litter lignin, and litter cellulose were not significantly changed. The effects of N addition on C chemical composition varied among different ecosystems/plant types and different forms of N addition. Increasing treatment duration did not significantly change the effects of N addition on the chemical composition of plant, litter, and soil C. With increasing N addition rate, the effect of N addition on plant lignin, plant fiber, plant cellulose, and plant protein increased, while the effect of N addition on plant hemicellulose, plant NSC, and litter cellulose became more negative. Our meta--analysis provided a systematic evaluation of the responses of different C chemical components to N addition in the plant-litter-soil continuum. Results suggest that the change of plant and soil C chemical composition under N addition may be beneficial for ecosystem C sequestration and could affect ecosystem structure and function in the future.",carbon cycle; cellulose; lignin; meta-analysis; nitrogen deposition; non-structural carbohydrate

We conducted a meta-analysis using paired control data of shrubencroached grassland (SEG) vs. non-SEG collected from 142 studies worldwide. SOC contents (0-50 cm) were altered by shrub encroachment, with changes ranging from -50% to + 300%, with an effect size of 0.15 (p < 0.01). The SOC contents increased in semi-arid and humid regions, and showed a greater rate of increase in grassland encroached by leguminous shrubs than by non-legumes. The SOC content decreased in silty and clay soils but increased in sand, sandy loam and sandy clay loam. The SOC content increment was significantly positively correlated with precipitation and temperature as well as with soil bulk density but significantly negatively correlated with soil total nitrogen. We conclude the main effects of shrub encroachment would be to increase topsoil organic carbon content. As structural equation model revealed, soils properties seem to be the primary factors responsible for the extent of the changes, coarse textured soils having a greater capacity than fine textured soils to increase the SOC content. This increased effect appears to be secondarily enhanced by climate and plant elements.",Carbon/*chemistry; Climate; Grassland; Nitrogen/chemistry; Soil/*chemistry; Temperature
562,excluded,Soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in forests along an altitudinal gradient in the eastern Himalayas and a meta-analysis of global data,"High-altitude soils potentially store a large pool of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). The assessment of total C and N stocks in soils is vital to understanding the C and N dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we examined effects of altitude and forest composition on soil C and N along a transect from 317 to 3300 m a.s.l. in the eastern Himalayas. We used meta-analysis to establish the context for our results on the effects of altitude on soil C, including variation with depth. Total C and N contents of soils significantly increased with altitude, but decreased with soil depth. Carbon and N were similarly correlated with altitude and temperature, and temperature was seemingly the main driver of soil C along the altitudinal gradient. Altitude accounted for 73% of the variation in C and 47% of the variation in N stocks. Soil pH and cation exchange capacity were correlated with both soil C and N stocks. Increases in soil C and N stocks were related to forest composition, forest basal area as well as quantity of leaf litter that were in turn influenced by altitude and temperature. Concentrations of C in foliage increased by 2.1% for every 1000 m rise in altitude, while that in leaf litter increased by 2.3%.",altitude; carbon stocks; forest; Himalayas; meta-analysis; nitrogen stocks
563,excluded,Soil and the foliage nutrient status following soil amendment applications in a japanese cypress (chamaecyparis obtusa endlicher) plantation,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the response of soil amendment applications on soil and the foliage nutrient status of a Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa Endlicher) plantation established following clear-cutting in a pine-wilt-disease (PWD)-disturbed forest. We established four soil amendment treatments [(compound fertilizer (CF), compound fertilizer + biochar (CFB), compound fertilizer + sawdust (CFS) and a non-treated control treatment] in an 8-year-old Japanese cypress plantation. Soil organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) were not significantly different (P > 0.05) between the soil amendment treatments and the control treatments, whereas extractable phosphorus (P), NH4+, K+, and Mg2+ concentrations were significantly affected by the addition of biochar in CF. The mean soil CO2 efflux rates during the study period were the highest in CFB (0.79 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1)), followed by CFS (0.71 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1)), CF (0.62 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1)), and the control (0.46 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) treatments. Foliar N and P concentrations were significantly higher in the CFB than in the control treatments. The results suggest that the addition of biochar in CF can enhance extractable soil nutrients and foliar N and P conditions of Japanese cypress established in a PWD-disturbed forest.",Biochar; fertilization; forest disease; pine wilt disease; sawdust; vegetation restoration
564,excluded,A commentary on 'mineral soil carbon fluxes in forests and implications for carbon balance assessments': a deeper look at the data,"Forestry practitioners contacted us with their concerns about a recent review article by Buchholz T, Friedland AJ, Hornig CE, Keeton WS, Zanchi G, Nunery J (2013) GCB Bioenergy who questioned the way soil carbon is treated in many models and protocols, and indicated that an increasing number of research studies showed meaningful soil organic carbon (SOC) loss as a result of forest management. We revisit the major studies cited in the review and present a more complete look at the results, consistently treat forest floor carbon as a separate pool, discuss differences in interpretation, and suggest opportunities to advance the state of knowledge regarding SOC and forest carbon accounting. Overall, we conclude that the literature continues to support the current default assumption of little or no change in mineral SOC when sound forest management practices are followed.",
565,included,Global patterns of the dynamics of soil carbon and nitrogen stocks following afforestation: a meta-analysis,"Afforestation has been proposed as an effective method of carbon (C) sequestration; however, the magnitude and direction of soil carbon accumulation following afforestation and its regulation by soil nitrogen (N) dynamics are still not well understood. We synthesized the results from 292 sites and carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the dynamics of soil C and N stocks following afforestation. Changes in soil C and N stocks were significantly correlated and had a similar temporal pattern. Significant C and N stock increases were found 30 and 50 yr after afforestation, respectively. Before these time points, C and N stocks were either depleted or unchanged. Carbon stock increased following afforestation on cropland and pasture, and in tropical, subtropical and boreal zones. The soil N stock increased in the subtropical zone. The soil C stock increased after afforestation with hardwoods such as Eucalyptus, but did not change after afforestation with softwoods such as pine. Soil N stocks increased and decreased, respectively, after afforestation with hardwoods (excluding Eucalyptus) and pine. These results indicate that soil C and N stocks both increase with time after afforestation, and that C sequestration through afforestation depends on prior land use, climate and the tree species planted.",afforestation; carbon-nitrogen interaction; dynamics; global pattern; meta-analysis; soil nitrogen; soil organic carbon
566,included,A meta-analysis of soil extracellular enzyme activities in response to global change,"The crucial biogeochemical processes such as carbon and nutrient cycling are increasingly altered at the eco-system scale by global environmental changes. Although soil extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) play a critical role in biogeochemical processes, the global patterns of soil EEAs in a changing world remain elusive. Here, we synthesized eight EEAs involved in carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) acquisition in response to seven global change factors based on 132 peer-reviewed papers. Our results showed that elevated CO2 concentration had no significant effects on soil EEAs. Nitrogen addition stimulated C-acquisition (9.1%) and P acquisition (9.9%) EEAs, but suppressed oxidase activity (-6.8%). Phosphorus addition decreased P-acquisition EEA (-19.8%), while combined N and P addition increased C-acquisition EEA (30.7%). Moreover, decrease in precipitation dramatically suppressed oxidase activity (-47.2%), increase in precipitation marginally stimulated N-acquisition EEA (16.7%), while warming significantly decreased oxidase activity (-10.9%) and had minor positive effect on hydrolytic enzymes. Overall, our results provide some evidence (with exceptions) for the resource allocation theory of microbial enzyme production, and indicate that EEAs are generally more sensitive to nutrient addition than to atmospheric and climate change. We have shown that global environmental changes can alter EEAs, which have implications for soil carbon storage, nutrient cycling, and plant productivity. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving the responses of EEAs to global change and to collect data from particularly non-forest ecosystems (e.g., wetland, tundra and desert) and global-change drivers (other than N addition) that lack of EEA data. Our synthesis of the responses of soil enzyme activities to global change drivers can be used to develop better representations of microbial processes in ecosystem and earth system models.",Extracellular enzyme activities; Climate change; Nitrogen addition; Resource allocation theory; Carbon storage; Nutrient cycling
567,included,Effects of grazing patterns on grassland biomass and soil environments in China: A meta-analysis,"Background Grazing has important influences on the structures and functions of grassland ecosystems, but the effects of grazing patterns on grassland biomass and soil environments in China remain unclear. Objective We employed a meta-analysis to identify the response of biomass and soil environments to different grazing patterns in China. Methods Peer-reviewed journal articles were searched using the Web of Science and China National Knowledge to compile a database. A total of 1011 sets of sample observations satisfied the sampling standards; these were derived from 140 study sites and were obtained from 86 published articles. We conducted random effects meta-analyses and calculated correlation coefficients with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Results Grazing significantly decreased the total biomass, aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), soil organic matter, soil total nitrogen, soil total phosphorus and soil water content but increased the root-to-shoot ratio, soil available nitrogen, soil pH and bulk density. Generally, increasing grazing intensity and duration significantly increased the effects of grazing on the biomass and soil environment. Additionally, the smallest effects of grazing on the biomass and soil environments were observed under light grazing and cattle grazing alone. Moreover, non-growing season grazing significantly increased AGB, while annual grazing and growing-season grazing significantly reduced AGB. Furthermore, AGB was positively correlated with soil organic matter, soil available phosphorus and bulk density, while BGB was negatively correlated with pH. Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of grazing patterns in the biomass and soil environment response to grazing and suggest that cattle grazing alone and grazing during the non-growing season are beneficial for improving the quality of grassland in China.",Animals; *Biomass; Carbon/analysis; Cattle; China; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior/*physiology; *Grassland; Herbivory/*physiology; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Nitrogen/analysis; Phosphorus/analysis; Seasons; Soil/*chemistry; Water/analysis
568,included,Afforestation Effects on Soil Carbon Storage in the United States: A Synthesis,"Afforestation (tree establishment on nonforested land) is a management option for increasing terrestrial C sequestration and mitigating rising atmospheric carbon dioxide because, compared to nonforested land uses, afforestation increases C storage in aboveground pools. However, because terrestrial ecosystems typically store most of their C in soils, afforestation impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage are critical components of ecosystem C budgets. We applied synthesis methods to identify the magnitude and drivers of afforestation impacts on SOC, and the temporal and vertical distributions of SOC change during afforestation in the United States. Meta-analysis of 39 papers from 1957 to 2010 indicated that previous land use drives afforestation impacts on SOC in mineral soils (overall average = +21%), but mined and other industrial lands (+173%) and wildlands (+31%) were the only groups that specifically showed categorically significant increases. Temporal patterns of SOC increase were statistically significant on former industrial and agricultural lands (assessed by continuous meta-analysis), and suggested that meaningful SOC increases require >= 15 and 30 yr of afforestation, respectively. Meta-analysis of C-13 data demonstrated the greatest SOC changes occur at the surface soil of the profile, although partial replacement of C stocks derived from previous land uses was frequently detectable below 1 m. A geospatial analysis of 409 profiles from the National Soil Carbon Network database supported C-13 meta-analysis results, indicating that transition from cultivation to forest increased A horizon SOC by 32%. In sum, our findings demonstrate that afforestation has significant, positive effects on SOC sequestration in the United States, although these effects require decades to manifest and primarily occur in the uppermost (and perhaps most vulnerable) portion of the mineral soil profile.",Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Critical component; Geo-spatial analysis; Partial replacement; Soil carbon storage; Soil organic carbon storages; Terrestrial ecosystems; Vertical distributions; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Cultivation; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Land use; Soils; Reforestation; afforestation; carbon budget; carbon isotope; carbon sequestration; land use change; meta-analysis; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil profile; Carbon; Chelation; Forestation; Soil; USA; United States
569,included,The magnitude and spatial extent of influence of Faidherbia albida trees on soil properties and primary productivity in drylands,"Faidherbia (Faidherbia albida) is being promoted widely in interventions for combating desertification, regreening of the Sahel and agroforestry projects in dry lands. Some scientists have questioned the wisdom of its wider promotion without clear evidence of its impacts. This review provides novel analyses of the magnitude and spatial extent of its influence on soil properties and primary productivity. A meta analysis provided evidence for significant increases in soil organic carbon (SOC) (by 46%), total nitrogen (50%), phosphorus (21%), potassium (32%), and yields of maize (150%) and sorghum (73%) under the tree canopy compared to the open area. However, larger increases in SOC and nutrients occurred on inherently nutrient-poor sites than on nutrient-rich sites. Similarly, large increases in crop yields occurred in suboptimal conditions for crop productivity than in optimal conditions. The tree created predictable patterns in soil nutrients and crop yields consistent with distance decay models of spatial interaction. Its growth and canopy development appear to explain the size dependence of the spatial extent of its influence, with a marked influence observed under large trees than small trees. The review also identified enormous variability in study design and statistical rigor, which appear to mask the expected patterns. Study designs and inferential statistics in current use neither address the intrinsic causality of patterns nor do they offer a mechanistic insight into the observed patterns. The major concerns and their implications are discussed and improvements for future research on single-tree influences on ecosystem properties in dry lands are suggested.

570,included,Does crop rotation yield more in China? A meta-analysis,"Crop rotation has been widely used to mitigate weed, insect, and pathogen pressure, as well as to increase plant diversity. However, the magnitude of and variability in crop yield with rotation in China remain uncertain. We conducted a meta-analysis on 45 studies with 214 comparisons to examine the effects of crop rotation on yield and to explore the importance of environmental factors and field management in determining yield variability. Rotation increased crop yields by 20% on average when compared with continuous monoculture practices. Effects of rotation on crop yield were more pronounced in southwestern China (+ 38%) than in eastern China (+10%) and were notably less reliable and generally smaller in regions with moderate annual rainfall (400-550 mm). Rotation had greater yield benefits in soils with coarse or medium soil textures, intermediate levels of initial soil organic carbon (7-10 g kg(-1)), and lower total nitrogen (<= 1.2 g kg (-1))( ). Effect of rotation on crop yield also depends on the type of previously cultivated crops (hereinafter, pre-crops), ranging from 2% for Triticeae pre-crops to 27% for grain leguminous pre-crops. Yield increase under legume-based rotations was 14% higher than that without legumes. The mean yield response of the crop subsequent to rotation ranged from 6% (cereals, except for Triticeae crops) to 34% (root crops). The legacy benefit of rotation on subsequent crop yield persisted for 2-3 years, decreasing from +31% in the second year to +8% in the third year. Effect of rotation on crop yield under conventional tillage was greater than that under conservation tillage. The yield benefit of rotation on subsequent crops was much higher with a lower nitrogen fertilization rate (<= 120 kg ha(-1)), indicating that fertilization can be reduced and an acceptable yield maintained with crop rotation. In conclusion, crop rotation largely increases agricultural production without extra inputs, although its design may need to consider diverse climates, soils, crops, and management practices to maximize its agronomic and environmental benefits.",Sustainable agriculture; Cropping systems; Crop diversity; Pre-crop effect; Legumes
571,excluded,Meta-analysis on carbon sequestration through Conservation Agriculture in Africa,"Africa is the smallest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions among the continents, but the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The effects will not be limited to a rising average temperature and changing rainfall patterns, but also to increasing severity and frequency in droughts, heat stress and floods. Agriculture is not only impacted upon by climate change but also contributes to global warming. However, not all agricultural systems affect negatively climate change. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is a farming system that promotes continuous no or minimum soil disturbance (i.e. no tillage), maintenance of a permanent soil mulch cover, and diversification of plant species. Through these principles it enhances biodiversity and natural biological processes above and below the ground surface, so contributing to increased water and nutrient use efficiency and productivity, to more resilient cropping systems, and to improved and sustained crop production. Conservation Agriculture is based on the practical application of three interlinked principles along with complementary good agricultural practice. The characteristics of CA make it one of the systems best able to contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. In this article, the carbon sequestration potential of CA is assessed, both in annual and perennial crops, in the different agro-climatic regions of Africa. In total, the potential estimate of annual carbon sequestration in African agricultural soils through CA amounts to 143 Tg of C per year, that is 524 Tg of CO2 per year. This figure represents about 93 times the current sequestration figure.",Carbon sequestration; No-tillage; Groundcovers; Climate change
572,excluded,Rhizosphere processes are quantitatively important components of terrestrial carbon and nutrient cycles,"While there is an emerging view that roots and their associated microbes actively alter resource availability and soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition, the ecosystem consequences of such rhizosphere effects have rarely been quantified. Using a meta-analysis, we show that multiple indices of microbially mediated C and nitrogen (N) cycling, including SOM decomposition, are significantly enhanced in the rhizospheres of diverse vegetation types. Then, using a numerical model that combines rhizosphere effect sizes with fine root morphology and depth distributions, we show that root-accelerated mineralization and priming can account for up to one-third of the total C and N mineralized in temperate forest soils. Finally, using a stoichiometrically constrained microbial decomposition model, we show that these effects can be induced by relatively modest fluxes of root-derived C, on the order of 4% and 6% of gross and net primary production, respectively. Collectively, our results indicate that rhizosphere processes are a widespread, quantitatively important driver of SOM decomposition and nutrient release at the ecosystem scale, with potential consequences for global C stocks and vegetation feedbacks to climate.",
573,excluded,Prognostic value of myocardial perfusion analysis in patients with coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis,"Background: Myocardial perfusion (MP) imaging during stress myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) improves the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, its prognostic value to predict cardiac events in patients with known or suspected CAD is still undefined. Methods: A search was conducted for single-or multicenter prospective studies that evaluated the prognostic value of stress MCE in patients with known or suspected CAD. A database search was performed through June 2015. Effect sizes of relative risk ratios (RRs) with their corresponding 95% CIs were used to evaluate the association between the occurrence of total cardiac events (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization) and hard cardiac events (cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction) in subjects with normal and abnormal MP measured by MCE. The Cochran Q statistic and the I 2 statistic were used to assess heterogeneity. Results: A comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane, and Embase databases identified 11 studies enrolling a total of 4,045 patients. The overall analysis of RRs revealed that patients with abnormal MP were at higher risk for total cardiac events compared with patients with normal MP (RR, 5.58; 95% CI, 3.64-8.57; P < .001), with low heterogeneity among trials (I-2 = 48.15%, Q = 7.71, P = .103). Similarly, patients with abnormal MP were at higher risk for hard cardiac events compared with patients with normal MP (RR, 4.99; 95% CI, 1.75-14.32; P = .003), with significant heterogeneity among trials (I-2 = 81.48%, Q = 21.59, P < .001). Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that MP assessment using stress MCE is an effective prognostic tool for predicting the occurrence of cardiac events in patients with known or suspected CAD.

574,excluded,Impact of biochar application on yield-scaled greenhouse gas intensity: a meta-analysis,"The application of biochar to agricultural ecosystems is a potential solution to mitigate climate change and guarantee food security. However, the impacts of biochar on greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield are usually evaluated separately and the results are contradictory in individual studies. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted based on data from 28 peer-reviewed studies to quantify the impacts of biochar application on greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield using yield-scaled greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI). Potential factors (experimental conditions and properties of soil and biochar) influencing the effect of biochar on yield-scaled GHGI were explored. The results showed that overall, biochar significantly reduced yield-scaled GHGI by 29%. The reductions in yield-scaled GHGI induced by biochar varied with different experimental conditions and properties of soil and biochar. However, the difference was only significant between the two cropping systems, with significantly greater reduction being observed in dry lands (-41%) than in paddy fields (-17%). Therefore, it is suggested that biochar amendment in dry lands may bring more environmental and agronomic benefits than that in paddy fields. The response of crop yield to biochar application further implied that biochar made from crop residue, biochar produced at low pyrolysis temperatures (<= 400 degrees C), and biochar with high pH (>9.0) might contribute to save the production cost of biochar while promoting crop yield in agricultural ecosystems. Long-term field trials are required to elucidate the persistence of the impact of biochar on reducing yield-scaled GHGI and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. The balance between the price of biochar production and the benefits brought by biochar should also be focused in further studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

575,included,Decreasing soil microbial diversity is associated with decreasing microbial biomass under nitrogen addition,"While aboveground biodiversity has been widely studied, how microbial biodiversity responds to increasing nitrogen (N) deposition is still unclear. Here we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the responses of soil microbial diversity and composition to N addition. Overall, we found N addition decreased both soil microbial diversity and the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Nitrospirae, although the effect may vary among different ecosystems. The effect size on microbial Shannon index was positively correlated with the changes in soil microbial biomass under N addition. The initial soil conditions, the duration of treatment, the N addition rate and changes in soil organic carbon under N addition all affected the effect sizes of N addition on microbial Shannon index, while changes in soil pH played a minor role. Overall, our results suggest that the losses of microbial diversity with increasing N deposition rate would alter ecosystem functions and may have profound feedbacks to global climate change.",Nitrogen deposition; Belowground communities; Microbial biomass; Microbial diversity; Global biogeography; Meta-analysis
576,excluded,How the deadwood of different tree species in various stages of decomposition affected nutrient dynamics?,"The aim of the study was to estimate how the deadwood of different tree species in various stages of decomposition affected nutrient dynamics. The deadwood of eight species (common alder, common aspen, common ash, silver fir, pedunculate oak, Norway spruce, common hornbeam and silver birch) was selected. Three logs from each species in the third, fourth and fifth decay classes were chosen for analysis. Wood in the third decay class was characterised by larger hard fragments, fragmented bark and no branches; in the fourth decay class, it was characterised by small pieces and a fragmented bark; and in the fifth decay class, it was characterised by a soft texture and no bark. The investigation was carried out in the Czarna Rzga Reserve in Central Poland. Tension lysimeters were installed under each log in the humus horizon. The water samples collected from tension lysimeters were chemically analysed in the laboratory. The water chemistry was analysed by means of ion chromatography using a DIONEX ICS 5000 unit. The leachate obtained from different tree species contained different ion concentrations. The high similarity of the concentration of total anions and statistically significant differences in the content of total cations were determined in the leachate from the wood of coniferous and deciduous species. The concentration of the cations increases with the advancement of the decomposition level. A general linear model analysis demonstrates that wood species and the decomposition classes are of equal importance in defining the ion composition of the filtrate leaching from deadwood. Wood at the highest decomposition stage releases more ions to the surface soil layers than wood at the lower decay class. An exception from the rule is the wood of birch, which in the III decay class releases more ions than in its higher decay classes. When comparing the ionic composition of leachate released from wood of coniferous and deciduous tree species, the latter are characterised by higher cation concentrations in comparison with coniferous species. Among the deciduous species, wood of such species as ash, hornbeam, aspen, birch and alder has the most favourable effects on the soil surface horizons through its supply with ionic substances. The ash wood releases high amounts of calcium, hornbeam wood releases magnesium and sodium, and aspen releases calcium, potassium and nitrate anion. From the analysed coniferous species, fir wood has a more favourable effect in terms of ion release to soil than spruce wood.",Dead lying trees; Decomposition stages; Forest ecosystem; Water chemistry

Materials and methods: Women with at least one self-reported traumatic childbirth experience in or after 2005 were invited to participate through various social media platforms in March 2016. They completed a 35-item questionnaire including validated screening instruments for PTSD (PTSD Symptom Checklist, PCL-5), social support (Oslo social support scale, OSS-3), and coping (Antonovsky's sense of coherence scale, SoC). Results: Of the 1,599 women who completed the questionnaire, 17.4% met the diagnostic criteria for current PTSD according to the DSM-5, and another 26.0% recognized the symptoms from a previous period, related to giving birth. Twenty-six percent of the participating women had received one or more psychiatric diagnoses at some point in their life, and five percent of all women had been diagnosed with PTSD prior to their traumatic childbirth experience. Women with poor (OR = 15.320, CI = 8.001-29.336), or moderate (OR = 3.208, CI = 1.625-6.333) coping skills were more likely to report PP-PTSD symptoms than women with good coping skills. Low social support was significantly predictive for current PP-PTSD symptoms compared to high social support (OR = 5.557, CI = 2.967-7.785). A predictive model which could differentiate between women fulfilling vs. not fulfilling the symptom criteria for PTSD had a sensitivity of 80.8% and specificity of 62.6% with an accuracy of 66.5%. Conclusions: Low social support, poor coping, experiencing ""threatened death"" and experiencing ""actual or threatened injury to the baby"" were the four significant factors in the predictive model for women with a traumatic childbirth experience to be at risk of developing PP-PTSD. Further research should investigate the effects of interventions aimed at the prevention of PP-PTSD by strengthening coping skills and increasing social support, especially in women at increased risk of unfavorable obstetrical outcomes.",posttraumatic stress disorder; childbirth; traumatic experience; predictors; social support; coping; prevention

A meta-analysis of 582 paired-treatment data from 95 long-term field experiments published from 1980 to 2012 was used to characterize the changes in SOC under different fertilization treatments and residue management practices in China's paddy soils. All treatments sequestrated significant amounts of C compared with the control (CK, no fertilizer application). The greatest mean difference in SOC change rates was measured in the NPKM (mineral nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium plus manure) treatment, i.e., 0.401 g kg(-1) yr(-1), followed by the M (manure only) treatment (0.36 g kg(-1) yr(-1)), while the N (mineral nitrogen only) treatment caused the lowest rate of 0.046 g kg(-1) yr(-1). The rates of SOC change in the fertilization treatthents with C incorporation (e.g., manure application or straw return) were noticeably higher than those treated with inorganic chemical fertilizers only. The mean difference in the SOC change rates decreased with time and duration of the experiments. The effects of the initial SOC content on the rates of SOC change were not significant, and the effects of SOC accumulation originating from the fertilization treatments depended on the cropping systems. Potential SOC sequestration estimates were more accurate when two factors (sequestration duration and SOC saturation level) were taken into consideration. Our results indicate that the application of manure (e.g., M or NPKM) showed the greatest potential for C sequestration in agricultural soil and produced the longest SOC sequestration duration (45-51 yr).

579,excluded,A meta-analysis on pyrogenic organic matter induced priming effect,"Pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) is considered an important soil carbon (C) sink. However, there are evidences that its addition to soil may induce a priming effect (PE) thus influencing its C abatement potential. The direction, the size and the mechanisms responsible for PyOM induced PE are far from being understood. We collected approximately 650 data points from 18 studies to analyse the characteristics of the PE induced by PyOM. The database was divided between the PE induced on the native soil organic matter and on fresh organic matter. Most of the studies were short-term incubation therefore the projections of findings on the long term may be critical. Our findings indicate that over 1year PyOM induces an average positive PE of 0.3mgCg(-1) soil on native soil organic matter and a PE of approximately the same size but opposite direction on fresh organic matter. We studied the correlation of PE with several properties of soil, of the added PyOM, and time after PyOM addition. We found that PyOM primes positively the native soil organic matter in the first 20days while negative PE appears in a later stage. Negative PE was correlated with the soil C content. PyOM characterized by a low C content induced a higher positive PE on native soil organic carbon. No correlation was found between the factors record in our database and the PE induced on the fresh organic matter. We reviewed the mechanisms proposed in literature to explain PE and discussed them based on findings from our meta-analysis. We believe that the presence of a labile fraction in PyOM may trigger the activity of soil microorganisms on the short term and therefore induce a positive PE, while on the long term PyOM may induce a negative PE by promoting physical protection mechanisms.",
580,included,Impact of soil properties on the soil methane flux response to biochar addition: a meta-analysis,"In an effort to optimize soil management practices that can help mitigate terrestrial carbon emissions, biochar has been applied to a wide range of soil environments to examine its effect on soil greenhouse gas emissions. Such studies have shown that the soil methane (CH4) flux response can vary widely leading to both increase and decrease in CH4 flux upon biochar amendment. To address this discrepancy, multiple meta-analysis studies have been performed in recent years to determine the key factors that may control the direction of CH4 flux upon biochar treatment. However, even comparing across conclusions from meta-analyses reveals disagreement upon which factors ultimately determine the change in direction and magnitude of CH4 flux due to biochar addition. Furthermore, using multiple observations from a single study can lead to misinterpretation of the influence of a factor within a meta-analysis due to non-independence. In this study, we use a multivariate meta-regression approach that allows factor interactions to investigate which biochar, soil, and management practice factors in combination or individually best explain the CH4 flux response in past biochar amendment studies. Our results show that the interaction of multiple soil factors (i.e., water saturation, soil texture, and soil organic carbon content) best explains the soil CH4 flux response to biochar addition (minimum deviance information criterion (DIC) value along with lowest heterogeneity) as compared to all models utilizing individual factors alone. These findings provide insight into the specific soil factors that should be taken into account simultaneously when optimizing the CH4 flux response to biochar amendments and building empirical models to quantitatively predict soil CH4 flux.",Carbon; Charcoal/*chemistry; Methane/*chemistry; Soil/*chemistry
581,excluded,Why the better-than-average effect is a worse-than-average measure of self-enhancement: an investigation of conflicting findings from studies of east asian self-evaluations,"A recent meta-analysis on cross-cultural studies of self-enhancement finds that evidence for East Asian self-enhancement is consistently apparent only in studies where participants compare themselves to the average other, aka the '' Better-than-Average '' Effect (BAE). However, prior research has suggested that the BAE may conflate motivations to view the self in a positive light with non-motivational factors, such as a tendency to evaluate '' everyone as better than average '' [EBTA; Klar Y, Gilladi EE (1997) J Personal Soc Psychol 73:885-901]. In two studies, European-Canadian, Asian-Canadian, and Japanese students were asked to evaluate themselves as well as a fictitious student compared to the average. Replicating prior research, evidence for Japanese self-enhancement was found with the BAE, albeit weaker than Canadians. However, in the measures where the EBTA effect was circumvented, self-enhancement was no longer evident among Japanese. Likewise, within the BAE method, prior research has found that East Asians self-enhance more for important than unimportant traits. When the EBTA effect was circumvented this correlation was also significantly reduced. Findings from this research converge with other sources of evidence that East Asians do not appear to be motivated to self-enhance.",
582,excluded,Family history of exceptional longevity is associated with lower serum uric acid levels in ashkenazi jews,"OBJECTIVES: To test whether lower serum uric acid (UA) levels are associated with longevity independent of renal function. DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: Ashkenazi Jewish individuals with exceptional longevity (Longevity Genes Project at Albert Einstein College of Medicine). PARTICIPANTS: Long-lived individuals (LLI) of Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity (mean age +/- standard deviation 97.7 +/- 2.9, n = 365), their offspring (mean age +/- standard deviation 68.2 +/- 8.2, n = 593) and controls (without family history of longevity, mean age +/- standard deviation 72.5 +/- 9.9, n = 356). MEASUREMENTS: Association between UA levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as well as chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage, and correlation of UA levels of LLI and offspring were determined. Because LLI lack an appropriate control group, UA levels, eGFR, and prevalence of hyperuricemia and CKD stages were compared between offspring and controls. RESULTS: Offspring were less likely to have hyperuricemia and had lower UA levels than controls. Despite negative correlation between UA levels and eGFR and positive correlation between UA levels and CKD stages, eGFR and the prevalence of CKD stage III to V were not found to be different between offspring and controls. Furthermore, significant association between UA levels in LLI and their offspring (beta estimate 0.1544, 95% confidence interval = 0.08 -0.23, P < .001) has been observed. CONCLUSION: Offspring had lower UA levels than controls despite similar renal function, suggesting that other factors such as UA metabolism or renal tubular transport determine UA levels. The association between UA levels and longevity is particularly intriguing because UA levels are potentially modifiable with diet and drugs. J Am Geriatr Soc 60:745-750, 2012.",
583,included,"Fine root biomass, production and turnover rates in plantations versus natural forests: effects of stand characteristics and soil properties","AimsFine roots play a significant role in regulating the biogeochemical cycles of forest ecosystems, but how fine root biomass (FRB), production (FRP) and turnover rates (FRT) vary with forest origins remains not well understood.MethodsThe meta-analysis approach was used to examine the differences in FRB, FRP and FRT between plantations and their adjacent natural forests based on 238 cases reported in 45 published studies.ResultsFRB and FRP were 36.5% and 36.0% lower, respectively, in plantations than in natural forests. FRT was 22.4% higher in plantations relative to natural forests. The decrease in FRB in plantations relative to natural forests varied among plantations with different plant genera and root diameter classes. The general patterns for FRP and FRT in relation to various factors (biogeographic zone, leaf form, leaf seasonality, plant genus in plantations, and root diameter class) did not differ among the groups. The difference in FRB between plantations and natural forests was positively correlated with stand age but negatively related with soil totalnitrogen concentration, the difference in FRP was positively affected by diameter at breast height (DBH) and soil pH, and the difference in FRT was positively affected by DBH, tree height, soil bulk density and soil pH and negatively affected by soil organic carbon and totalnitrogen concentration.ConclusionsFRB, FRP and FRT exhibit significant differences between plantations and natural forests and that these differences are partially caused by shifts in stand characteristics and variations in soil properties.",Fine roots; Forest origins; Planted forests; Stand structure; Soil nutrient
584,included,Effect of fertilization on soil microorganisms in paddy rice systems - A meta-analysis,"Soil microorganisms are considered a sensitive indicator of soil health and quality. In cropping systems, soil microorganisms are strongly affected by crop management, including the application of fertilizers. While studies in natural ecosystems have generally found that increased nitrogen (N) inputs decrease microbial biomass, microorganisms in soils under upland crops often benefit from mineral fertilizer input. Paddy rice soils, being flooded for part of the season, are dominated by different carbon (C) and N cycle processes and microbial communities than soils under upland crops. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of fertilizer on soil microorganisms in paddy rice systems in a meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed literature. Across all studies (n = 55), the addition of mineral fertilizer significantly increased microbial biomass carbon content (MBC) by 26% in paddy rice soils. Mineral fertilizer applications also increased soil organic carbon content (SOC) by 13%. The higher crop productivity with fertilization likely led to higher organic C inputs, which in turn increased SOC and MBC contents. The time of sampling within a season (pre-plant rice, in-season rice, post-harvest rice, or post-harvest rotational crop) did not significantly affect the response of MBC to mineral fertilizer. The positive effect of mineral fertilizer on MBC content did not differ between cropping systems with continuous rice and systems where paddy rice was grown in rotation with other crops. However, compared with upland cropping systems, the increase in the microbial biomass due to mineral fertilizer application is more pronounced in rice cropping systems, even when rice is grown in rotation with an upland crop. Differences in climate and soil oxygen availability likely explain the stronger response of soil microorganisms to mineral fertilizer input in paddy rice systems. Our analysis suggests that fertilization does not consistently select for specific microbial groups (e.g. gram positive or negative bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes) in paddy rice systems; however, it affects microbial community composition through changes in soil properties. How specific groups of microorganisms respond to mineral fertilization likely depends on environmental factors. Overall, our results suggest that in paddy rice systems the application of inorganic fertilizers increases SOC and MBC contents, both of which are important indicators of soil health.

585,excluded,Historical soil amendment with charcoal increases sequestration of non-charcoal carbon: a comparison among methods of black carbon quantification,"We have shown previously that soil with historical (>150 years) applications of charcoal had larger recent (C4-maize derived) carbon content than adjacent soil; however, we could not determine whether there was an effect on older, C3-plant-derived, soil organic carbon (SOC). Therefore, we assessed the effect of historical additions of charcoal on the sequestration of recent and older SOC with a combination of delta C-13 analysis and different quantification techniques for black carbon (BC): dichromate oxidation (Cr2O7), chemo-thermal oxidation (CTO-285) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Topsoils cropped with maize (Zea mays) under former charcoal production sites (N = 12) were identified in the field as black spots and had a larger (3.5%, P < 0.05) percentage of organic carbon (OC) contents than adjacent soil outside these spots (2.0%). The charcoal content varied with the detection technique used as follows: CTO-285 > DSC > Cr2O7. Black spots contained 1.6-1.7 times more (P < 0.05) maize-derived OC content than adjacent soil, irrespective of the BC quantification technique. The content of non-charcoal OC was 1.0-1.4 times larger in black spots than in adjacent soil, but differences were significant only for the Cr2O7 method. Soil physicochemical fractionation showed that at charcoal production sites more OC was recovered in the particulate organic matter and silt and clay fractions. The delta C-13 analysis suggested that additional maize-OC in black spots was in the physically more protected silt and clay fraction. Overall, this study shows that historical charcoal amendment in soil enhances the accumulation of recent maize-derived OC in a temperate climate without replacing the older C stocks.",
586,included,Element interactions limit soil carbon storage,"Rising levels of atmospheric CO2 are thought to increase C sinks in terrestrial ecosystems. The potential of these sinks to mitigate CO2 emissions, however, may be constrained by nutrients. By using metaanalysis, we found that elevated CO2 only causes accumulation of soil C when N is added at rates well above typical atmospheric N inputs. Similarly, elevated CO2 only enhances N-2 fixation, the major natural process providing soil N input, when other nutrients (e.g., phosphorus, molybdenum, and potassium) are added. Hence, soil C sequestration under elevated CO2 is constrained both directly by IN availability and indirectly by nutrients needed to support N2 fixation.",global climate change; N-2 fixation; soil organic matter

This has been explained by deficits in self-management and resources, such as enabling social support, planning, and self-regulation in the face of barriers. The present study examines the role of perceived social support, planning, and self-regulation in facilitating physical activity. Methods: In a prospective online study, intention was assessed at baseline (Time 1), planning and social support at 4-week follow-up (Time 2), self-regulation and physical activity at 6-month follow-up (Time 3). A path analysis was conducted to shed light on mediating psychological mechanisms contributing to maintenance of physical activity. Results: Perceived support (Time 2), planning (Time 2), and self-regulation (Time 3) mediated the link from intention (Time 1) to physical activity (Time 3); the specific and total indirect effects were significant. Conclusions: Findings suggest that perceived social support, planning, and self-regulation can bridge the intention-behavior gap.

589,excluded,Reversing land degradation through grasses: a systematic meta-analysis in the Indian tropics,"Although intensive agriculture is necessary to sustain the world's growing population, accelerated soil erosion contributes to a decrease in the environmental health of ecosystems at local, regional and global scales. Reversing the process of land degradation using vegetative measures is of utmost importance in such ecosystems. The present study critically analyzes the effect of grasses in reversing the process of land degradation using a systematic review. The collected information was segregated under three different land use and land management situations. Meta-analysis was applied to test the hypothesis that the use of grasses reduces runoff and soil erosion. The effect of grasses was deduced for grass strip and in combination with physical structures. Similarly, the effects of grasses were analyzed in degraded pasture lands. The overall result of the meta-analysis showed that infiltration capacity increased approximately 2-fold after planting grasses across the slopes in agricultural fields. Grazing land management through a cut-and-carry system increased conservation efficiencies by 42 and 63% with respect to reduction in runoff and erosion, respectively. Considering the comprehensive performance index (CPI), it has been observed that hybrid Napier (Pennisetum purpureum) and sambuta (Saccharum munja) grass seem to posses the most desirable attributes as an effective grass barrier for the western Himalayas and Eastern Ghats, while natural grass (Dichanthium annulatum) and broom grass (Thysanolaena maxima) are found to be most promising grass species for the Konkan region of the Western Ghats and the northeastern Himalayan region, respectively. In addition to these benefits, it was also observed that soil carbon loss can be reduced by 83% with the use of grasses. Overall, efficacy for erosion control of various grasses was more than 60 %; hence, their selection should be based on the production potential of these grasses under given edaphic and agro-ecological conditions. The present analysis also indicated that grass must be used as a vegetative strip to maintain soil quality in sloppy arable areas (8.5 Mha) of Indian hilly regions. Similarly, due attention should be paid for establishing grasses in 3 Mha of degraded pasture lands and 3.5 Mha of shifting cultivation areas in India to reverse the land degradation.",

The aim of the study was to perform a systematical review and meta-analysis comparing CCTA with other standard-of-care (SOC) approaches in evaluation of patients with acute chest pain. Methods Electronic databases were systematically searched to identify randomised clinical trials of patients with acute chest pain comparing CCTA with SOC approaches. We examined the following end points: mortality, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), myocardial infarction (MI), invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and revascularisation. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and their 95% CIs were calculated using random-effects models. Results Ten trials with 6285 patients were included. The trials used different definitions and implementation for SOC but all used physiologic testing. The clinical follow-up ranged from 1 to 19 months. There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.36, p=0.17), MI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.39, p=0.47) or MACE (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.43, p=0.92) between the groups. However, significantly higher rates of ICA (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.63, p=0.01) and revascularisation (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.31, p<0.0001) were observed in the CCTA arm. Conclusions Compared with other SOC approaches use of CCTA is associated with similar major adverse cardiac events but higher rates of revascularisation in patients with acute chest pain.",
591,excluded,Environmental controls on soil respiration across a southern us climate gradient: a meta-analysis,"Carbon (C) cycling in the soil is intimately associated with soil respiration as organic matter is decomposed by microbes. Consequently, soil C stocks and sequestration potential are also intimately associatedwith soil respiration. Althoughmany soils of the southern and southeastern United States (US) are generally more weathered and contain less C than those of the upper Midwest due to moist, and generallywarmer climatic conditions, their soil C sequestration potential may be greater due to their ability to produce biomass year-round, which, in turn, results in greater C inputs. Identifying influential environmental factors that control soil respiration across a large geographic area and climate gradient can improve understanding of soil C sequestration potential in the southern US. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of i) physiographic region (i.e.,Arkansas Ozark Highlands, Arkansas Delta, and Florida Flatwoods) and ii) soil moisture regime (i.e., udic and aquic) on the relationship among soil respiration and combined soil moisture and soil temperature related environmental parameters. Despite some expected differences and generally low model predictiveness (R-2 < 0.4), results showed numerous similarities among multiple regression model coefficient estimates across widely differing physiographic regions along a southern climate gradient. Results also showed the relationship among soil respiration and soil moisture and soil temperature related environmental parameters differed (P < 0.05) between soil moisture regimes within regions. Improving the ability to predict soil respiration from directly measured and/or indirectly calculated environmental parameters will increase the understanding of factors controlling soil C sequestration, and potential agronomic and ecological sustainability, in the weathered soils of the southern and southeastern US.

Soil conditions, such as initial soil organic matter and soil pH, were more important for increasing soil pH in field-based experiments, while lime material type and application method were more important for improving crop yield. To effectively neutralize soil acidity, the optimum liming duration, rate, and material type were<3years, 3-6Mgha(-1), and Ca (OH)(2), respectively. Averaged across different crop species, the application of CaO, CaCO3, Ca (OH)(2), and CaMg (CO3)(2) increased yield by 13.2, 34.3, 29.2, and 66.5%, respectively.ConclusionsThis meta-analysis will help design liming management strategies to ameliorate soil acidity and thus improve crop yield in agroecosystems.",Liming; Liming material; Soil acidity; Soil nutrients; Yield

We compiled and analysed field-measured data for annual background N2O emission in agricultural (BNEA) and natural (BNEN) lands from 600 and 307 independent experimental studies, respectively. There were no significant differences between BNEA (median: 0.70 & mean: 1.52 kg N2O -aEuro parts per thousand N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and BNEN (median:0.31 & mean:1.75 kg N2O -aEuro parts per thousand N ha(-1) yr(-1)) (P > 0.05). A simultaneous comparison across all BNEA and BNEN indicated that BNEs from riparian, vegetable crop fields and intentional fallow areas were significantly higher than from boreal forests (P < 0.05). Correlation and regression analyses supported the underlying associations of soil organic carbon (C), nitrogen (N), pH, bulk density (BD),and/or air temperature (AT) with BNEs to a varying degree as a function of land-use or ecosystem type (Ps < 0.05). Although overall BNEN tended to be lower than BNEA on median basis, results in general suggest that land-use shifts between natural and managed production systems would not result in consistent changes in BNE.",

They are therefore an important asset for soil fertility and crop growth. This study quantifies the additional yield effect due to organic inputs for arable crops in Europe when macro-nutrients are not a limiting factor. A meta-analysis was performed using data from 20 long-term experiments in Europe. Maxima of yield response curves to nitrogen were compared, with and without organic inputs, under abundant P and K supply. We were surprised to find that, across all experiments, the mean additional yield effect of organic inputs was not significant (+ 1.4 % +/- 1.6 (95 % confidence interval)). In specific cases however, especially for root and tuber crops, spring sown cereals, or for very sandy soils or wet climates, organic inputs did increase attainable yields. A significant correlation was found between increase in attainable yields and increase in soil organic matter content. Aggregating data from 20 long-term experiments in Europe, this study shows that organic inputs and/or soil organic matter do not necessarily increase yields, given sufficient nutrients are supplied by mineral fertilisers. Results show the relevance of some environmental factors for additional yield effect of organic inputs, but no simple relation between organic inputs and crop growth.",Soil fertility; Soil organic matter; Organic inputs; Crop yield; Food security; Soil carbon sequestration

However, the overall effects of CRU on maize productivity and reactive nitrogen (N) losses remain unclear. Our global meta-analysis based on 866 observations of 120 studies indicated that application of CRU instead of urea (same N rate) increased maize yield by 5.3% and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by 24.1%, and significantly decreased nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, N leaching and ammonia (NH3) volatilization by 23.8%, 27.1% and 39.4%, respectively. The increase of NUE and reduction of N2O emission by CRU application were greater with medium and high N rates (150 <= N < 200 and N >= 200 kg N ha(-1)) than with low N rates. The reduction in N2O emission and N leaching with CRU application were enhanced when soil organic carbon (SOC) content was <15.0 g kg(-1), and soil texture was medium or coarse. The reduction in N2O emission and NH3 volatilization with CRU were greater in soils with pH >= 6.0. We concluded that use of CRU should be encouraged for maize production, especially on light-textured soils with low organic matter content. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We measured the distribution and quality of SOC in a mosaic of rangeland-forest vegetation types that occurs under similar climatic conditions on non-calcareous soils at Utah State University's T.W. Daniel Experimental Forest in northern Utah: the forest types were aspen [Populus tremuloides] and conifer (mixture of fir [Abies lasiocarpal and spruce [Picea engelmannii]); the rangeland types were sagebrush steppe [Artemisia tridentata], grass-forb meadow, and a meadow-conifer ecotone. Total SOC was calculated from OC concentrations, estimates of bulk density by texture and rock-free soil volume in five pedons. The SOC quality was expressed in terms of leaching potential and decomposability. Amount and aromaticity of water-soluble organic carbon (DOC) was determined by water extraction and specific ultra violet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA) of leached DOC. Decomposability of SOC and DOC was derived from laboratory incubation of soil samples and water extracts, respectively. Although there was little difference in total SOC between soils sampled under different vegetation types, vertical distribution, and quality of SOC appeared to be influenced by vegetation. Forest soils had a distinct O horizon and higher SOC concentration in near-surface mineral horizons that declined sharply with depth. Rangeland soils lacked O horizons and SOC concentration declined more gradually. Quality of SOC under rangelands was more uniform with depth and SOC was less soluble and less decomposable (i.e., more stable) than under forests. However, DOC in grass-forb meadow soils was less aromatic and more bioavailable, likely promoting C retention through cycling. The SOC in forest soils was notably more leachable and decomposable, especially near the soil surface, with stability increasing with soil depth. Across the entire dataset, there was a weak inverse relationship between the decomposability and the aromaticity of DOC. Our data indicate that despite similar SOC pools, vegetation type may affect SOC retention capacity under future climate projections by influencing potential SOC losses via leaching and decomposition.

597,excluded,Accuracy of root modelling and its impact on simulated wheat yield and carbon cycling in soil,"Accurate modelling of root biomass and root distribution of crop plants has become increasingly important in order to address issues related to carbon sequestration in soil and resource use efficiency of crops under different environmental and management conditions. However, the performance of crop models for simulating crop root system has been rarely tested in many environments due to lack of detailed data on roots. In this paper, we present detailed measurement data on root biomass and distribution in 0-200 cm soil profile at key developmental stages of wheat crop at Wuqiao in the North China Plain, and compare them with the root dynamics simulated by the agricultural systems model APSIM. The objectives are to test the model performance for simulating root biomass and distribution, and to investigate the potential impact of errors in root modelling on simulated wheat yield and soil carbon change. Compared to the measurements at the study site, APSIM version 7.5 underestimated the rooting front advance and final rooting depth of winter wheat, but overestimated the root biomass and root-shoot ratio at maturity by 100-200%. Modifications to root growth parameters in the model led to improved simulations of root depth and biomass dynamics. The modifications had little impact on simulated shoot biomass and grain yield under conditions of sufficient nitrogen supply, but led to higher simulated grain yield when nitrogen was deficient. They also resulted in reduction in simulated soil organic carbon in the top (0-20 cm) soil layer by 0.02%. A meta-analysis combining wheat root and shoot data from literature indicated that the APSIM model simulated a much tighter root-shoot relationship than that observed in the data, and that both versions of the model simulated the root-shoot relationships within the measured range. The relationship simulated from the original model better matched the data points from dry climate and dryland conditions. While the modified model based on Wuqiao data simulated a relationship better matching the data points from wet climate and irrigated conditions. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness (incremental [A] cost per A quality adjusted life-year [QALY]; or cost utility) of evolocumab plus standard of care (SoC; statins) versus SoC, assuming lifetime treatment. Cohorts with baseline LDL-C > 100 mg/dL and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or CV event history (secondary prevention [SP]) were considered. Lifetime CV event rates were predicted either (1) using risk equations considering local risk factors (Spanish Familial Hypercholesterolemia Cohort Study) adjusted to reflect the increased risk of FH patients or (2) using CV event rates from local registries (Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care) for SP patients. LDL-C relative reductions from evolocumab trials (Evolocumab 140 mg Q2W (bi-weekly) and 420 mg QM (monthly)) were converted into CV event reductions using rate ratios per millimole per liter (mmol/L; 38.67 mg/dL) from a meta-analysis of statin trials (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration). Findings: Predicted 10-year/lifetime CV risks were 50%/95% (FH) and 62%/82% (SP) for SoC and 27%/83% (FH) and 44%/69% (SP) for evolocumab plus SoC.

Emissions-mitigating land use options include displacement of fossil fuels via biofuel production and afforestation. Comparing C recovery dynamics under these different options is crucial to assessing the efficacy of offset programs. In this paper, we focus on forest recovery on marginal land, and show that there is substantial inaccuracy and discrepancy in the literature concerning carbon accumulation. We find that uncertainty in carbon accumulation occurs in estimations of carbon stocks and models of carbon dynamics over time. We suggest that analyses to date have been largely unsuccessful at determining reliable trends in site recovery due to broad land use categories, a failure to consider the effect of current and post-restoration management, and problems with meta-analysis. Understanding of C recovery could be greatly improved with increased data collection on pre-restoration site quality, prior land use history, and management practices as well as increased methodological standardization. Finally, given the current and likely future uncertainty in C dynamics, we recommend carbon mitigation potential should not be the only environmental service driving land use decisions on marginal lands.",

601,excluded,Atmosphere-soil carbon transfer as a function of soil depth,"The exchange of carbon between soil organic carbon (SOC) and the atmosphere affects the climate(1,2) and-because of the importance of organic matter to soil fertility-agricultural productivity(3). The dynamics of topsoil carbon has been relatively well quantified(4), but half of the soil carbon is located in deeper soil layers (below 30 centimetres)(5-7), and many questions remain regarding the exchange of this deep carbon with the atmosphere(8). This knowledge gap restricts soil carbon management policies and limits global carbon models(1,9,10). Here we quantify the recent incorporation of atmosphere-derived carbon atoms into whole-soil profiles, through a meta-analysis of changes in stable carbon isotope signatures at 112 grassland, forest and cropland sites, across different climatic zones, from 1965 to 2015. We find, in agreement with previous work(5,6), that soil at a depth of 30-100 centimetres beneath the surface (the subsoil) contains on average 47 per cent of the topmost metre's SOC stocks. However, we show that this subsoil accounts for just 19 per cent of the SOC that has been recently incorporated (within the past 50 years) into the topmost metre. Globally, the median depth of recent carbon incorporation into mineral soil is 10 centimetres. Variations in the relative allocation of carbon to deep soil layers are better explained by the aridity index than by mean annual temperature. Land use for crops reduces the incorporation of carbon into the soil surface layer, but not into deeper layers. Our results suggest that SOC dynamics and its responses to climatic control or land use are strongly dependent on soil depth. We propose that using multilayer soil modules in global carbon models, tested with our data, could help to improve our understanding of soil-atmosphere carbon exchange.",

Despite differences in time since fire and dominant post-fire vegetation, forest floor and mineral soil organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations and pools were not significantly different between burned and unburned pairs or across sites. However, mineral soil carbon : nitrogen ratio was significantly higher in the burned area of B9-UB (0-10 cm) and B5-UB (10-20 cm), indicating small losses of nitrogen relative to carbon, likely from plant uptake or possibly leaching of nitrogen post fire. Combined, the data suggest that traditional fire management did not dramatically affect forest floor and mineral soil organic carbon and total nitrogen dynamics at these sites.",C : N ratio; forest floor; mineral soil layers; Wondo Genet Forest
603,excluded,Understanding carbon storage in volcanic soils under selectively logged temperate rainforests,"A disturbance due to selective logging causes the release of carbon from forest soils. Here, we examine this effect under Nothofagus stands in Andisols of southern Chile (39 degrees 38'S, 72 degrees 02'W, > 4000 mm yr(-1)). We postulate that soil carbon destabilization caused by forest management is counteracted by two contrasting carbon stabilization mechanisms linked to pedogenic processes: (1) the formation of allophane-imogolite-like materials (i.e., short-range ordered aluminosilicate particles with a specific Al/Si molar ratio, for example in the present study 3.8) and (2) formation of Al- and Fe-carbon complexes. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of selective logging on the organic carbon storage of forest Andisols. We estimated that carbon storage occurred in the uppermost 1 m of soils under evergreen (EGF) and secondary growth mixed deciduous forests (DMF). The selective dissolution method was used to estimate the mechanisms of soil carbon storage. The soil carbon storage under the unmanaged EGF did not differ significantly from that of the stands measured 10 or 50 years after selective logging. Likewise, the soil carbon storage under DMF was similar to that under stands measured 2, 6 or 50 years after selective logging. Overall, soil carbon storage was 24% lower under DMF than under EGF, which was attributed to the faster decomposition of organic matter produced by deciduous forests. The soil pH of the Ah-horizon was significantly lower (4.5-5.1) than that of the subsoil (5.5-6.0) due to the leaching of cations, leading to the development of less allophanic properties (i.e., an aluandic horizon). This effect increased the formation of organo-mineral complexes and reduced the content of allophane-imogolite-like precursors (e.g., non-crystalline Si and Al). As a result, an inverse relationship was found between metals (Al, Fe) complexed with carbon and the content of non-crystalline Si and Al, both of which were within single horizons and the entire soil profile in general. We conclude that disturbances caused by forest management did not alter carbon storage in these Andisols, which can be explained by (1) the potential mechanisms of carbon stabilization studied here and (2) humid climate, which protected the bare horizon from irreversible drying after the management of these ecosystems, thus preventing potential carbon loss.",Soil carbon sequestration; Soil organic matter stabilization mechanisms; Forest logging
604,excluded,Greenhouse gas emissions and soil organic matter dynamics in woody crop orchards with different irrigation regimes,"Water scarcity in arid, semiarid and dry regions is a limiting factor for the development of sustainable agriculture. As a consequence, the adoption of new strategies such as regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) to reduce water and energy consumption will be essential. Decreases in irrigation water content may also have positive effects on soil C cycle. Thus, an experiment was setup in three woody crop orchards during two years, with the objective of assessing if RDI can reduce soil CO2 and N2O emissions, modify soil inorganic C and organic C quality and stability and affect soil aggregation. Soil CO2 and N2O emissions were measured every two weeks while soil samplings were carried out every three months. Results indicated that decreases in soil moisture by RDI implementation were related to significant decreases in CO2 emissions in all crops. RDI contributed to an average decrease, compared with full irrigation, of 1088-1664 g CO2 m(-2) in the experimental period. Furthermore, CO2 emission was negatively correlated with inorganic C, suggesting the protective effect of soil carbonates towards organic matter. RDI also contributed to significantly decrease soil N2O emissions. However, N2O emission patterns did not directly follow soil moisture patterns and were constant in the experimental period. RDI contributed to an average decrease, compared with full irrigation, of 90-409 mg N2O m(-2). No physicochemical property was significantly affected by irrigation regime. Although microbial biomass was not significantly affected by RDI, beta-glucosidase activity was significantly higher under full irrigation during the warm seasons, with significant positive correlation with CO2 emissions. This seems to suggest that a significant fraction of CO2 emitted from soil derives from organic matter degradation, which is limited with low water content. So, RDI could contribute to promote soil C sequestration by reduced greenhouse gas emissions, with no negative effects on soil structure at short-term. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

605,excluded,Multiple models and experiments underscore large uncertainty in soil carbon dynamics,"Soils contain more carbon than plants or the atmosphere, and sensitivities of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks to changing climate and plant productivity are a major uncertainty in global carbon cycle projections. Despite a consensus that microbial degradation and mineral stabilization processes control SOC cycling, no systematic synthesis of long-term warming and litter addition experiments has been used to test process-based microbe-mineral SOC models. We explored SOC responses to warming and increased carbon inputs using a synthesis of 147 field manipulation experiments and five SOC models with different representations of microbial and mineral processes. Model projections diverged but encompassed a similar range of variability as the experimental results. Experimental measurements were insufficient to eliminate or validate individual model outcomes. While all models projected that CO2 efflux would increase and SOC stocks would decline under warming, nearly one-third of experiments observed decreases in CO2 flux and nearly half of experiments observed increases in SOC stocks under warming. Long-term measurements of C inputs to soil and their changes under warming are needed to reconcile modeled and observed patterns. Measurements separating the responses of mineral-protected and unprotected SOC fractions in manipulation experiments are needed to address key uncertainties in microbial degradation and mineral stabilization mechanisms. Integrating models with experimental design will allow targeting of these uncertainties and help to reconcile divergence among models to produce more confident projections of SOC responses to global changes.",Soil organic carbon; Warming; Modeling; Meta-analysis; Litter addition; Decomposition
606,excluded,The effectiveness of compulsory drug treatment: a systematic review,"Background: Despite widespread implementation of compulsory treatment modalities for drug dependence, there has been no systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of compulsory drug treatment. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of studies assessing the outcomes of compulsory treatment. We conducted a search in duplicate of all relevant peer-reviewed scientific literature evaluating compulsory treatment modalities. The following academic databases were searched: PubMed, PAIS International, Proquest, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Soc Abstracts, JSTOR, EBSCO/Academic Search Complete, REDALYC, SciELO Brazil. We also searched the Internet, and article reference lists, from database inception to July 15th, 2015. Eligibility criteria are as follows: peer-reviewed scientific studies presenting original data. Primary outcome of interest was post-treatment drug use. Secondary outcome of interest was post-treatment criminal recidivism. Results: Of an initial 430 potential studies identified, nine quantitative studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies evaluated compulsory treatment options including drug detention facilities, short (i.e., 21-day) and long-term (i.e., 6 months) inpatient treatment, community-based treatment, group-based outpatient treatment, and prison-based treatment. Three studies (33%) reported no significant impacts of compulsory treatment compared with control interventions. Two studies (22%) found equivocal results but did not compare against a control condition. Two studies (22%) observed negative impacts of compulsory treatment on criminal recidivism. Two studies (22%) observed positive impacts of compulsory inpatient treatment on criminal recidivism and drug use. Conclusion: There is limited scientific literature evaluating compulsory drug treatment. Evidence does not, on the whole, suggest improved outcomes related to compulsory treatment approaches, with some studies suggesting potential harms. Given the potential for human rights abuses within compulsory treatment settings, non-compulsory treatment modalities should be prioritized by policymakers seeking to reduce drug-related harms.

607,included,Effect of improved management practices on soil organic carbon sequestration in wheat-maize double cropping system in north china,"Carbon sequestration in cropland soils which could be achieved through improved management practices (IPMs) represents an important opportunity to offset a portion of greenhouse gas emissions. North China is the main wheat and maize production region where many IMPs have been widely used during the last several decades, but the effect size and duration of IMPs on soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in wheat-maize double cropping system in this region is scarcely studied. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effect size and duration of four IMPs on SOC sequestration in wheat-maize double cropping system in north China. A total of 29 long-term experiments, consisting of 119 paired treatments were compiled in this analysis. The results indicated that the four IMPs of organic manure application (OM), organic manure combined with chemical fertilizer application (MF), straw return (SR) and reduced or no tillage (RNT) all had significant effects on SOC sequestration in the study area. On average, the IMPs of OM, MF, SR and RNT enhanced SOC density by 260, 328, 278 and 134 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively. The effect duration of OM, MF, SR and RNT on SOC sequestration were about 48, 26, 22 and 18 years, respectively. Accumulation enhancements of SOC for OM, MF, SR and RNT over SOC sequestration period were about 34.7%, 36.1%, 22.0% and 12.7%, respectively. OM and MF could be the appropriate practices on SOC sequestration in wheat-maize double cropping system in the research area.","improved management practice, soil organic carbon, carbon sequestration, wheat-maize double,cropping system, North China"

Mean fluxes ranged from -0.3 to 27.4 nmol CH4 m-2 s-1, with small emissions or low rates of net uptake in mineral soils (site means of -0.3 to 0.7 nmol m-2 s-1) and much larger emissions from organic soils (site means of -0.3 to 27.4 nmol m-2 s-1). Less than half of the observed variability in instantaneous fluxes could be explained by independent variables measured. The reasons for this include measurement error, stochastic processes and, probably most importantly, poor correspondence between the independent variables measured and the actual variables influencing the processes underlying methane production, transport and oxidation. When temporal variation was accounted for, and the fluxes averaged at larger spatial scales, simple models explained up to ca. 75% of the variance in CH4 fluxes. Soil carbon, peat depth, soil moisture and pH together provided the best sub-set of explanatory variables. However, where plant species composition data were available, this provided the highest explanatory power. Linear and nonlinear models generally fitted the data equally well, with the exception that soil moisture required a power transformation. To estimate the impact of changes in peatland water table on CH4 emissions in the United Kingdom, an emission factor of +0.4 g CH4 m-2 yr-1 per cm increase in water table height was derived from the data.",
609,included,Faster Decomposition Under Increased Atmospheric CO2 Limits Soil Carbon Storage,"Soils contain the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon (C) and are a major source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Thus, they may play a key role in modulating climate change. Rising atmospheric CO2 is expected to stimulate plant growth and soil C input but may also alter microbial decomposition. The combined effect of these responses on long-term C storage is unclear. Combining meta-analysis with data assimilation, we show that atmospheric CO2 enrichment stimulates both the input (+19.8%) and the turnover of C in soil (+16.5%). The increase in soil C turnover with rising CO2 leads to lower equilibrium soil C stocks than expected from the rise in soil C input alone, indicating that it is a general mechanism limiting C accumulation in soil.",Atmosphere/*chemistry; *Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide/*chemistry; Climate Change; Soil/*chemistry
610,included,Earthworms increase plant production: a meta-analysis,"To meet the challenge of feeding a growing world population with minimal environmental impact, we need comprehensive and quantitative knowledge of ecological factors affecting crop production. Earthworms are among the most important soil dwelling invertebrates. Their activity affects both biotic and abiotic soil properties, in turn affecting plant growth. Yet, studies on the effect of earthworm presence on crop yields have not been quantitatively synthesized. Here we show, using meta-analysis, that on average earthworm presence in agroecosystems leads to a 25% increase in crop yield and a 23% increase in aboveground biomass. The magnitude of these effects depends on presence of crop residue, earthworm density and type and rate of fertilization. The positive effects of earthworms become larger when more residue is returned to the soil, but disappear when soil nitrogen availability is high. This suggests that earthworms stimulate plant growth predominantly through releasing nitrogen locked away in residue and soil organic matter. Our results therefore imply that earthworms are of crucial importance to decrease the yield gap of farmers who can't -or won't- use nitrogen fertilizer.",

Although no obvious vertical band spectrum exists in Taihang Mountain region, vertical differentiation of ecological characteristics in the region is obvious. The ecosystem characteristics of vertical differentiation were analyzed using 4 typical ecological indices (land use, temperature, net primary productivity, and water yield). The ecosystem service functional pattern was determined based on analysis of the ecosystem services value per unit area. The 2 ecosystem critical zones of vertical differentiation (500-600 m and 1400-1500 m) were determined. The mountain area was divided into 3 ecological zones-sub-alpine zone (>1500 m), mid-mountain zone (600-1400 m) and hilly zone (<500 m). The ecosystem services functional pattern was as follows: provisioning services was the main ecosystem services function in the hilly zone, 4 ecosystem service functions were equally important in the mid-mountain zone, regulating, supporting and cultural services were the main ecosystem service functions in the sub-alpine zone. The model of ecosystem service regulation and management in 3 ecological zones was built based on the functional patterns to promote sustainable development.",sustainable development; mountain region; vertical differentiation; critical line; ecosystem service
612,included,The impact of biochar on soil carbon sequestration: Meta-analytical approach to evaluating environmental and economic advantages,"Soil carbon (SC) is important for food security, ecosystem functioning, and environmental health, especially in light of global climate change. The physico-chemical character of biochar (pyrolyzed crop residue) has been shown to augment SC levels. This review systematically compares the environmental and economic benefits of applying crop residue versus biochar produced from crop residues to soils and the potential implications for SC sequestration. Crop residues enhance the mineralization rate of SC, while biochar can increase or decrease SC depending on the types of biochar/soil and duration. Therefore, converting crop residues to biochar may be more efficient for sequestering SC, but may/may not be more cost-effective. In this review, special emphasis is given to understanding the underlying mechanisms and biogeochemical processes of biochar production, in particular: surface (crystallinity), redox, and ability to control electron transfer reactions. By using meta-analytics, we determined the role of biochar compared to crop residue to enhance the status of organic SC.",Biochar; Carbon storage; Crop residues; Greenhouse gas emission; Sequestration; Meta-analysis

To indirectly assess efficacy of cabozantinib versus standard-of-care (SoC) comparators in the first-line treatment of aRCC. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify randomized controlled studies in the first-line setting for aRCC. The outcomes analyzed were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted comparing OS and PFS hazard ratios (HRs). Thirteen studies were identified in the SLR to be eligible for inclusion in the NMA. The overall study populations were heterogeneous in terms of risk groups; some studies included favorable risk patients. In intermediate-risk patients, HRs (95% confidence interval) for PFS were 0.52 (0.33, 0.82), 0.46 (0.26, 0.80), 0.20 (0.12, 0.36), and 0.37 (0.20, 0.68) when cabozantinib was compared with sunitinib, sorafenib, interferon (IFN), or bevacizumab plus IFN, respectively. In poor-risk patients, the NMA also demonstrated significant superiority in terms of PFS for cabozantinib; HRs were 0.31 (0.11, 0.90), 0.22 (0.06, 0.87), 0.16 (0.04, 0.64), and 0.20 (0.05, 0.88), when cabozantinib was compared with sunitinib, temsirolimus, IFN, or bevacizumab plus IFN, respectively. When the overall study populations were compared, the results were similar to the subgroup analyses. OS HRs in all analyses favored cabozantinib, but were not statistically significant. The results suggest that cabozantinib significantly increases PFS in intermediate-, and poor-risk subgroups when compared to standard-of-care comparators. Although overall populations included favorable risk patients in some studies, the results seen were consistent with the subgroup analyses.",

Our goal was to evaluate the effect of long-term crop rotation and tillage on the quantity of C and N stored in SOM and microbial biomass. Two experimental sites were used to evaluate four rotationscontinuous corn (Zea mays L.) (CCC), corn-soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) (CS), corn-soybean-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (CSW), and continuous soybean (SSS), each split into chisel tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) subplots. The CSW rotation increased soil organic carbon (SOC) content compared to SSS; SSS also reduced total nitrogen (TN) compared to other rotations. Levels of SOC and TN were 7% and 9% greater under NT than CT, respectively. Rotation did not affect microbial biomass C and N (MBC, MBN) while tillage reduced only MBN at 10-20 cm compared to NT, likely related to dispersion of N fertilizers throughout the soil. Despite the apparent lack of sensitivity of microbial biomass, changes in SOC and TN illustrate the effects of rotation and tillage on SOM dynamics. The inclusion of crops with high C: N residues and no-till use both support higher C and N content in the top 20 cm of the soil.",rotation; no-till; soil biology
615,included,Contrasting approaches for estimating soil carbon changes in Amazon and Cerrado biomes,"The Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado are among the principal agricultural frontiers of the world, and have attracted global attention because of their potential to be a source or sink of atmospheric CO2. However, accurately quantifying alterations in soil organic carbon (SOC) due to land-use changes remains to be a major challenge. Using a meta-analysis, our objective was to evaluate tillage effects on SOC stocks in Brazil's Amazon and Cerrado biomes. Two approaches: (1) the classical SOC annual change rate which provides only an arithmetic average of SOC changes, and (2) the rate of annual change adjusted from management factors derived according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SOC methodology, which allows a temporal dataset adjustment, were used. Regardless of approach, conservation technologies such as no-tillage (NT) and integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems were identified as viable options for SOC sequestration, increasing it between 9 and 16%. One exception was adoption of NT in the Amazon forest, where SOC decreased by 9% over 20 years. Comparing results of the two approaches showed substantial differences between them. For conversions from NT to ICL or from native vegetation to full tillage (FT), the IPCC-based approach produced SOC stock estimates that were 65 and 47% lower, respectively, than with the classical approach. The IPCC approach also identified modeling covariate effects and was influenced less by outliers, thus reducing the risk of under or overestimating soil management effects on SOC.

The objective of the study was to determine the distribution and the main factors governing SOC storage along a representative toposequence in North-Eastern Algeria. The soil organic matter (SOM) was characterized by SOC content, carbon stocks, particle size distribution and mineralization potential. The amount and the dynamics of the deep SOC depended on the topographical position. In the mountain soils, most of the SOC stock (100 t C ha(-1)) was in the topsoil (0-30 cm) and associated with the > 50 mu m fractions (plant materials) whereas in the piedmont and alluvial plain soils, most of the SOC stock (168 t C ha(-1)) was accumulated in subsoil (30-100 cm) and associated with the < 20 mu m fractions (mineral fractions). The SOC in the subsoil contributed to SOC potential of mineralization and should not be underestimated, especially in the alluvial cultivated plains. This carbon should be considered as an important component in agro-ecological agriculture but it is also a potential source of CO2.

617,included,Response of alpine soils to nitrogen addition on the Tibetan Plateau: A meta-analysis,"A meta-analysis approach was used to identify general tendency of alpine soil responses to nitrogen fertilizer on the Tibetan Plateau. Nitrogen addition increased ammonium nitrogen (NH4(+)) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-), but decreased pH. Effects of nitrogen addition on soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), C:N ratio and pH differed among forests, alpine meadows and alpine steppes. Effects of nitrogen addition on NH4+, NO3-, soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) differed between alpine meadows and forests. Effects of NH4NO3 addition on SOC, TN, C:N ratio, NH4+, NO3-, MBC and pH differed with those of urea addition. The effect of nitrogen addition on pH was negatively correlated with mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation. Soil conditions in control plots were positively correlated with the effect of nitrogen addition on pH, but negatively correlated with the effect of nitrogen addition on TN. Nitrogen addition rate was correlated with the effect of nitrogen fertilizer on NO3- and pH. Nitrogen addition duration was positively correlated with the effect of nitrogen fertilizer on pH. Therefore, effects of nitrogen fertilizers on alpine soils varied with nitrogen fertilizer types; climatic warming and precipitation change regulated effects of nitrogen fertilizer on alpine soils; and response of alpine soils to nitrogen addition may depend on initial soil conditions, rate and duration of nitrogen addition on the Tibetan Plateau.

Based on this list of interventions, a three round Delphi exercise with an international and multidisciplinary expert panel, including patient research partners, was performed to achieve expert consensus. Results Six documents were included and used for further analysis. Out of them, 46 interventions have been extracted and 10 consensus based SOC were formulated. In addition, a patient version, written in a lay-understandable wording and in the format of checklist questions was developed. An example is SOC 5: People with OA should achieve optimal pain control using pharmacological and non-pharmacological means.

Design, setting, participants, & measurements: MEDLINE (1966 to December 2008), EMBASE (1980 to December 2008), and the Cochrane Trial Registry (Issue 4 2008) were searched for parallel and crossover randomized and quasi-randomized trials. Treatment effects were summarized as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (Cl) using a random effects model. Results: Fourteen trials (328 patients) were included. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5i) compared with placebo significantly increased the overall International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) score (three trials, 101 patients, MD 1.81, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.10), all of its individual domains, and the complete 15-item IIEF-5 (two trials, 80 patients, MD 10.64, 95% CI 5.32 to 15.96). End-of-treatment testosterone levels were not significantly increased by addition of zinc to dialysate (two trials, 22 patients, SMD 0.19 ng/dl, 95% CI -2.12 to 2.50), but oral zinc improved end-of-treatment testosterone levels. There was no difference in plasma luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormone level at the end of the study period with zinc therapy. Conclusions: PDE5i and zinc are promising interventions for treating sexual dysfunction in CKD. Evidence supporting their routine use in CKD patients is limited.

They particularly depend on soil organic matter (SOM) content, which is considered one of the main components of soil fertility. But agricultural intensification and the increase in the use of fertilisers of mineral origin in recent decades (to the detriment of the incorporation of organic materials in agricultural soils) have resulted in a continuous loss of agricultural soil quality and fertility, which is considered one of the greatest challenges to addressing global food security. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms driving soil improvement via soil microbiota could result in a sustainable improvement in crop yields. Soils were sampled in 40 intensively managed greenhouses in southeast Spain to understand how SOM influences soil fungal community and how both these factors influence plant development. The values of three out of four growth-related variables (plant height, aerial dry weight and leaf area, but not root dry weight) in both tomato and cucumber plants showed a positive relation with SOM content and soil fungal diversity. This study concludes that SOM is key for the maintenance of soil fertility in intensive horticulture and that it is linked to the composition and diversity of soil fungal community. Both SOM and soil fungal communities should be considered as essential factors in achieving high soil fertility, and ultimately, to ensure an optimum crop development.",fungal genera; greenhouse; monoculture

Here, we assess CO2 and CH4 fluxes from a forest soil in response to biochar additions using a before-after-control-intervention experimental design. Soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes were measured over a series of wetting cycles by coupling soil mesocosms equipped with auto-chambers to a laser-based spectrometer for high-frequency measurements of gas fluxes and related soil processes. We found that soil CO2 fluxes were higher and CH4 fluxes were less negative (e. g. reduced CH4 uptake) for the biochar-amended soil compared to the no biochar condition. Furthermore, biochar improved soil infiltrability under wet conditions, and enhanced soil moisture levels under dry conditions. Biochar additions shifted the point of maximum soil respiration (i.e. soil CO2 efflux) to a slightly wetter soil moisture level. The point of maximum CH4 uptake was also shifted to a slightly wetter moisture level for soil with biochar. Overall differences in soil gas fluxes were found to be minor compared to the increase in soil carbon resulting from the biochar addition. Biochar may thus contribute to improved forest management through increases to soil carbon stocks and improved soil moisture levels.",
622,included,Effects of plant diversity on soil carbon in diverse ecosystems: a global meta-analysis,"ABSTRACT Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a valuable resource for mediating global climate change and securing food production. Despite an alarming rate of global plant diversity loss, uncertainties concerning the effects of plant diversity on SOC remain, because plant diversity not only stimulates litter inputs via increased productivity, thus enhancing SOC, but also stimulates microbial respiration, thus reducing SOC. By analysing 1001 paired observations of plant mixtures and corresponding monocultures from 121 publications, we show that both SOC content and stock are on average 5 and 8% higher in species mixtures than in monocultures. These positive mixture effects increase over time and are more pronounced in deeper soils. Microbial biomass carbon, an indicator of SOC release and formation, also increases, but the proportion of microbial biomass carbon in SOC is lower in mixtures. Moreover, these species-mixture effects are consistent across forest, grassland, and cropland systems and are independent of background climates. Our results indicate that converting 50% of global forests from mixtures to monocultures would release an average of 2.70 Pg C from soil annually over a period of 20 years: about 30% of global annual fossil-fuel emissions. Our study highlights the importance of plant diversity preservation for the maintenance of soil carbon sequestration in discussions of global climate change policy.",biodiversity; soil carbon content; stand age; soil depth; microbial; biomass carbon

DESIGN Monocentric retrospective study of a prospective maintained database of all laser PVPs performed at our university hospital between December 2012 and June 2017. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 305 patients (three groups: younger than 70, 70-80, and older than 80 years) were operated on in our hospital center for the treatment of urinary tract disorders related to benign prostatic hyperplasia. RESULTS A difference was found between the three age groups, with a higher rate of complications for patients older than 80 years (45%) (P = .013). Rate of patients with postoperative bladder catheters at 1 year was higher for patients older than 80 years (15%) (P = .004). Postoperative quality-of-life (QoL) score was worse for patients older than 80 years (P = .04). For patients with an indwelling bladder catheter undergoing surgery, morbidity was greater in patients older than 80 years, but the difference was not significant. International Prostate Symptom Score and QoL score were not significantly different between the three groups. Rate of patients with a remaining bladder catheter at 1 year was higher for patients older than 80 years (17.1% vs 7.1% for patients between 70 and 80, and 4.8% for patients under 70.) but with no statistical difference. CONCLUSION PVP had a greater morbidity in octogenarians compared to younger subjects. Functional results were less satisfactory for patients older than 80 years compared to younger ones. For subjects operated on with an indwelling bladder catheter, no significant difference in outcome and morbidity was found between the three groups.

624,excluded,Impact of phyllosilicate mineralogy on organic carbon stabilization in soils: incomplete knowledge and exciting prospects,"Soil mineral phases strongly influence soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. Clay-size particles have been recognized as protecting SOC from microbial decomposition. Among clay-size minerals, phyllosilicates (clay minerals) have been shown to efficiently protect SOC. There is an important variety of phyllosilicate types present in soils which have contrasting surface properties (specific surface area, charge density). Although these differing surface properties should influence their ability in protecting SOC, this has not been clearly established yet. Publications comparing the ability of the different phyllosilicates to protect SOC are reviewed in this study. Relatively few studies dealing with the link between phyllosilicate mineralogy and SOC protection exist. The few existing studies have followed different methodologies and are based on various analytical techniques, such that direct comparisons among them are difficult. More problematic, they provide different conclusions. Indeed, if experiments conducted in suspension using pure clay phases and recent meta-analyses suggest that phyllosilicate mineralogy has a significant importance for SOC stabilization and SOC stock response to land-use change, these results are not clearly corroborated by studies conducted on a reduced number of soils. The recent technical developments which allow improving both quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the soil clay mineral assemblages, together with nanoscale investigations of phyllosilicate/OM interactions, offer exciting perspectives for determining more accurately the efficiency of the different phyllosilicate types in SOC protection. Such information may provide a much clearer understanding of the impact of phyllosilicate mineralogy on SOC dynamics in the coming years.",

We investigated changes in soil properties and the soil bacterial community composition in the topsoil (0-20 cm) following afforestation on cropland on the Loess Plateau. Forests of six types ranging from 23 to 25 years in age were chosen in this study: Robinia pseudoacacia (RP), Platycladus orientalis (PO), Pinus tabuliformis (PT), Robinia pseudoacacia + Platycladus orientalis (RPPO), Robinia pseudoacacia + Pinus tabuliformis (RPPT), and Platycladus orientalis + Pinus tabuliformis (POPT). Afforestation with different tree species altered the soil nutrient contents, with total nitrogen (TN) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+) contents increased by 18.28-87.10% and 13.97-141.34%, respectively, and available phosphorus (AP) content decreased by 56.09-82.13% compared to cropland sites. Cropland afforestation reduced the soil bacterial richness and core bacterial genera abundance (relative abundance >= 0.1%), and significantly altered the bacterial diversity. Soil properties explained 73.41% of the total variation in the core soil bacterial community composition at the genus level, and soil organic carbon (SOC), TN, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-), NH4+, AP, pH and the carbon:phosphorus (C:P) ratio were significantly correlated with first two RDA (redundancy analysis) axes. The results of hierarchical clustering indicated that the soil bacterial community composition in the RPPO, RPPT and POPT sites was largely affected by Platycladus, Pinus tabuliformis and Platycladus, respectively. Our observations suggest that soil bacterial community composition and diversity following afforestation were mainly affected by tree species, followed by soil parameters. The effect of afforestation on the soil bacterial diversity was larger than its effect on bacterial richness.",Single and mixed tree species; Loess Plateau; 16S rRNA sequencing; Core bacterial genera group
626,excluded,Evidence for the effectiveness of chlorhexidine bathing and health care-associated infections among adult intensive care patients: a trial sequential meta-analysis,"BackgroundHealth care associated infections (HAI) among adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) have been shown to increase length of stay, the cost of care, and in some cases increased the risk of hospital death (Kaye et al., J Am Geriatr Soc 62:306-11, 2014; Roberts et al., Med Care 48:1026-35, 2010; Warren et al., Crit Care Med 34:2084-9, 2006; Zimlichman et al., JAMA Intern Med 173:2039-46, 2013). Daily bathing with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) has been shown to decrease the risk of infection in the ICU (Loveday et al., J Hosp Infect 86:S1-S70, 2014). However, due to varying quality of published studies, and varying estimates of effectiveness, CHG bathing is not universally practiced. As a result, current opinion of the merit of CHG bathing to reduce hospital acquired infections in the ICU, is divergent, suggesting a state of clinical equipoise'.This trial sequential meta-analysis aims to explore the current status of evidence for the effectiveness of chlorhexidine (CHG) bathing, in adult intensive care patients, to reduce hospital acquired infections, and address the question: do we need more trials?MethodsA systematic literature search was undertaken to identify trials assessing the effectiveness of chlorhexidine bathing to reduce risk of infection, among adult intensive care patients. With particular focus on: (1) Blood stream infections (BSI); (2) Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSI); (3) Multi-Resistant Drug Organism (MRDO); (4) Ventilator Associated Pneumonia; and, Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI). Only randomised-control or cluster randomised cross-over trials, were include in our analysis. A Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) was used to describe the current status of evidence for the effectiveness of chlorhexidine (CHG) bathing, in adult intensive care patients, to reduce hospital acquired infections.ResultsFive trials were included in our final analysis - two trials were individual patient randomised-controlled, and the remaining cluster-randomised-crossover trials. Daily bathing with CHG was estimated to reduce BSI in the ICU by approximately 29% (Der-Simonian and Laird, Random-Effects.(DL-RE) Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)=0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51, 0.98); reduce CLABSI in the ICU by approximately 40% (DL-RE IRR=0.60, 95% CI 0.34, 1.04); reduce MDRO in the ICU by approximately 18% (DL-RE IRR=0.82, 95% CI 0.69, 0.98); no effect in reducing VAP in the ICU (DL-RE IRR=1.33, 95% CI 0.81, 2.18); and, no effect in reducing CAUTI in the ICU (DL-RE IRR=0.77, 95% CI 0.52, 1.15). Upper (superiority) monitoring boundaries from TSA were not crossed for all five specific infections in the ICU.ConclusionRoutine bathing with CHG does not occur in the ICU setting, and TSA suggests that more trials are needed to address the current state of clinical equipoise'. Ideally these studies would be conducted among a diverse group of ICU patients, and to the highest standard to ensure generalisability of results.",Intensive care; Preventing hospital acquired infection; Chlorhexidine bathing; Meta-analysis; Trial sequential analysis
627,excluded,Response of deep soil carbon pools to forest management in a highly productive andisol,"Soil contains more C than the atmosphere and plant biomass combined. Consequently, it is the most important long-term sink for C within terrestrial ecosystems. An understanding of the potential to induce C sequestration in soils through management is crucial in light of increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, soil has historically been under-represented in C cycling research, especially regarding subsurface (>30 cm) layers and processes. Research on the effects of forest management practices on deep soil C has been lacking. To test the effects of biomass removal and vegetation control treatments on deep soil C, soils were sampled to a depth of 3 m at the Fall River Long-term Soil Productivity Site in western Washington State. Treatments were installed 15 yr previously in a complete randomized block design. No difference was found in total soil C among treatments, but there was significantly less (a = 0.10) C stored at the deepest interval measured (250-300 cm) in the plots with vegetation control (8.6 Mg C ha(-1)) than in those without (16.3 Mg C ha(-1)). These results suggest the stability of soil C pools at Fall River and indicate that more intensive management practices may not deplete C pools at this site, but imply that these deep soil pools may be more sensitive to change than shallow pools. Here, 58.2% of the soil C pool is located below 30 cm, which demonstrates that shallow sampling significantly underestimates soil C pools and highlights the importance of understanding processes that control deep soil C.",
628,included,Dynamics of soil carbon and nitrogen stocks after afforestation in arid and semi-arid regions: A meta-analysis,"Arid and semi-arid regions store approximately 27% of global soil organic carbon (SOC), thus playing an important role in the global carbon cycle. Although afforestation is widely used to achieve the goals of landscape protection and ecological restoration in these regions, its effects on the dynamics of SOC and total nitrogen (TN) stocks as well as the related controlling factors are still poorly understood. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted by compiling results from published studies to evaluate the influences of afforestation on dynamics of SOC and TN stocks in mineral soils (0-30 cm) in arid and semi-arid regions, and to examine whether the changes in SOC and TN stocks were influenced by prior land-use, planted tree species and plantation age. The results showed that overall, afforestation significantly increased SOC stock by 131% and TN stock by 88%. Prior land-use was found to be the most important factor that influenced the dynamics of SOC and TN stocks following afforestation. Significantly larger increases in SOC and TN stocks were observed after barren land afforestation in comparison to cropland and grassland afforestation. The accumulations in SOC and TN stocks after afforestation decreased in the following order: broadleaf deciduous forests > coniferous forests N broadleaf evergreen forests. However, significant differences in SOC and TN accumulations were only detected between broadleaf deciduous forests and broadleaf evergreen forests. Plantation age did not affect the dynamics of SOC and TN stocks after afforestation, mainly due to the rapid accumulations in SOC and TN after barren land afforestation. The results indicate that afforestation, especially on barren land with broadleaf deciduous species, provides substantial opportunities for SOC and TN sequestrations in arid and semi-arid regions.

629,excluded,What are the effects of agricultural management on soil organic carbon in boreo-temperate systems?,"Background: Soils contain the largest stock of organic carbon (C) in terrestrial ecosystems and changes in soil C stocks may significantly affect atmospheric CO2. A significant part of soil C is present in cultivated soils that occupy about 35 % of the global land surface. Agricultural intensification has led to practices that may decrease soil organic carbon (SOC), and agricultural management has the potential to be a powerful tool for climate change mitigation and increased soil fertility through SOC sequestration. Here, we systematically map evidence relating to the impacts of agricultural management on SOC in arable systems of the warm temperate and snow climate zones (subset of temperate and continental climates: Koppen-Geiger Classification). Methods: Seventeen academic citation databases, 3 search engines and 25 organisational websites were searched for literature (academic and grey) using search strings translated into a range of languages relevant to the included geographical scope of the topic. Stakeholders were also contacted with requests for evidence. Bibliographic checking of 127 relevant reviews was undertaken to check for missing articles. Screening for relevance against predefined inclusion criteria was undertaken at title, abstract and full text levels according to a published protocol. All relevant studies were coded in a meta-database describing the citation, study settings, methods and quantitative data available (without extraction of the study findings). A basic critical appraisal of included studies was also performed. A geographical information system (GIS) presenting the map database on a physical, online map was also produced. Results: A total of 735 studies from 553 articles was included in the systematic map database. Studies investigated one or more of five broad categories of interventions: amendments (286 studies), crop rotations (238), fertilisers (307), tillage (306), and multiple interventions (55). Studies were identified from across the includible climate zones, with the notable underrepresentation from Russia. The majority of studies employed only point sampling of SOC, low levels of true spatial replication and moderate study periods (i.e. 10-20 years). Missing key methodological information was found in 28 % of studies. Conclusions: Long-term study sites identified in this map provide a useful addition to existing databases of longterm experiments (LTEs). The identification of knowledge gaps, such as studies from Russia, also identify a need for improved cataloguing or reporting of existing and on-going research. This systematic map database represents a useful resource for decision-makers wishing to identify knowledge gaps warranting further primary research, knowledge gluts warranting further secondary research, and deficiencies and best practice in research methodology. In addition to the systematic map database, we have also produced two further resources: (1) a database of LTE sites investigating agricultural management and SOC, and (2) a database of reviews and meta-analyses. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review or map that utilises a GIS for presentation of an evidence base, which we believe substantially increases the utility of the map outputs.",
630,excluded,Depth heterogeneity of soil organic carbon dynamics in a heavily grazed alpine meadow on the northeastern tibetan plateau: a radiocarbon-based approach,"A deep understanding of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics on the Tibetan Plateau is crucial for predicting the response of the alpine carbon pool to future climate changes. Here we present information about SOC stocks and turnover time in a heavily grazed alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau based on radiocarbon (C-14) measurements and inverse modeling. Our results reveal that the alpine meadow soil is composed of three distinct carbon pools. The topsoil represents the active carbon pool, which has a carbon inventory-weighted mean turnover time of 64years. The CO2 efflux due to the mineral soil respiration from this pool is approximately 48.45gCm(-2)yr(-1), accounting for 91% of the total heterotrophic soil respiration. The intermediate carbon pool has an inventory-weighted mean turnover time of 780years, and the rate of mineral soil respiration in this pool is an order of magnitude lower than that in the active carbon pool. The parental materials feature the passive carbon pool, which has millennia-long turnover time and the mineral soil respiration is trivial. Comparing our results with other C-14-based studies suggests that grazing intensity may alter not only the SOC stocks but also the soil respiration rate in the alpine grassland ecosystem. The heavily grazed alpine meadow broadly fits the exponential relationship between turnover time and mean annual air temperature identified by meta-analysis of published data from the Tibetan Plateau, alpine grassland, and forest sites elsewhere.",Alpine meadow; Tibetan Plateau; radiocarbon; soil organic carbon; turnover time; grazing
631,included,"Response of soil carbon dioxide fluxes, soil organic carbon and microbial biomass carbon to biochar amendment: a meta-analysis","Biochar as a carbon-rich coproduct of pyrolyzing biomass, its amendment has been advocated as a potential strategy to soil carbon (C) sequestration. Updated data derived from 50 papers with 395 paired observations were reviewed using meta-analysis procedures to examine responses of soil carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes, soil organic C (SOC), and soil microbial biomass C (MBC) contents to biochar amendment. When averaged across all studies, biochar amendment had no significant effect on soil CO2 fluxes, but it significantly enhanced SOC content by 40% and MBC content by 18%. A positive response of soil CO2 fluxes to biochar amendment was found in rice paddies, laboratory incubation studies, soils without vegetation, and unfertilized soils. Biochar amendment significantly increased soil MBC content in field studies, N-fertilized soils, and soils with vegetation. Enhancement of SOC content following biochar amendment was the greatest in rice paddies among different land-use types. Responses of soil CO2 fluxes and MBC to biochar amendment varied with soil texture and pH. The use of biochar in combination with synthetic N fertilizer and waste compost fertilizer led to the greatest increases in soil CO2 fluxes and MBC content, respectively. Both soil CO2 fluxes and MBC responses to biochar amendment decreased with biochar application rate, pyrolysis temperature, or C/N ratio of biochar, while each increased SOC content enhancement. Among different biochar feedstock sources, positive responses of soil CO2 fluxes and MBC were the highest for manure and crop residue feedstock sources, respectively. Soil CO2 flux responses to biochar amendment decreased with pH of biochar, while biochars with pH of 8.1-9.0 had the greatest enhancement of SOC and MBC contents. Therefore, soil properties, land-use type, agricultural practice, and biochar characteristics should be taken into account to assess the practical potential of biochar for mitigating climate change.",biochar; carbon dioxide; climate change; microbial biomass carbon; soil organic carbon

Electronic searches were performed in five databases. Manual searches were also performed. To be included, studies needed to address the relationship between SOC and OHRQoL. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scales for cross-sectional and cohort studies and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale for clinical trials. Seven cross-sectional studies, four cohort studies, and one clinical trial were included in the present review. Two independent reviewers selected the studies, extracted that data, and performed the evaluations of methodological quality based on the standardized scales. The majority of authors found a significant association between a weak SOC and greater impact on OHRQoL, but some methodological flaws were found in the execution of the studies. Based on the analysis of the studies included in the present systematic review, there is scientific evidence that a sense of coherence exerts an influence on oral health-related quality of life, but further population-based studies are needed to confirm such evidence.",Sense of coherence; Quality of life; Oral health
633,excluded,Efficacy of hypertonic saline dextran fluid resuscitation for patients with hypotension from penetrating trauma,"Background: The purpose of this study was to assess whether the administration of hypertonic saline dextran (HSD) was detrimental when administered to patients who were hypotensive because of penetrating injuries to the torso. The administration of HSD causes an immediate and sustained increase in blood pressure that could contribute to an increase in bleeding in the presence of uncontrolled hemorrhage. We prospectively designed a series of questions to be addressed by a meta-analysis of individual patient data using a computerized data file and case report forms from a multicenter study of HSD. Methods: The investigators were ""blind"" as to the treatment the patient received. Patients (n = 230) with penetrating injuries to the torso were studied as to survival until discharge. The patients were administered 250 mL of HSD or normal saline (standard of care [SOC]) as the initial fluid therapy. Results: Of the 120 patients treated with HSD, 82.5% survived compared with 75.5% for 110 SOC patients (p = 0.19). Sixty-eight percent (n = 157) of these patients required surgery. HSD treatment (n = 84) in this population improved survival, 84.5% compared with 67.1% with SOC (n = 73) (p = 0.01). HSD resulted in an increase in blood pressure and a reduction in hematocrit, with no differences noted in fluid requirements or indices of clotting. conclusion: For patients with penetrating injuries to the torso that result in hypotension, initial fluid resuscitation with HSD is beneficial in improving survival, especially if surgery is subsequently required.",
634,excluded,Knowledge mapping of carbon footprint research in a lca perspective: a visual analysis using citespace,"Carbon emissions are inevitably linked to lifestyle and consumption behaviours, and the concept of ""carbon footprinting"" is now well-recognised beyond academia. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is one of the primary tools for assessing carbon footprints. The aim of this paper is to present a systematic review of literatures focusing on carbon footprint calculated with life cycle assessment. We used CiteSpace software to draw the knowledge map of related research to identify and trace the knowledge base and frontier terminology. It was found that the LCA application in respects of carbon footprint studies was completed mainly for the following aspect: beef production and dairy industry, seafood and fishery, nutrition, urban structure and energy use. The CiteSpace analysis showed the development path of the above aspects, for example, beef production and dairy industry has been a long-term topic in this kind of research, while the topic of nutrition appeared in recent years. There was also a cluster of literature discussing footprint evaluation tools, such as comparing LCA with input-output analysis. The CiteSpace analysis indicated that earlier methodological literature still plays an important role in recent research. Moreover, through the analysis of burst keywords, it was found that agriculture productions (dairy, meat, fish, crop) as well as global climate issues (greenhouse gases emission, global warming potential) have always been the areas of concern, which matches the result of co-citation analysis. Building materials (low-carbon building, natural buildings, sustainable buildings) and soil issues (soil carbon sequestration, soil organic carbon) are the topics of recent concern, which could arouse the attention of follower-up researchers.",carbon footprint; life cycle assessment; CiteSpace; a visual analysis
635,excluded,Long-term fertilization of a boreal norway spruce forest increases the temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon mineralization,"Boreal ecosystems store one-third of global soil organic carbon (SOC) and are particularly sensitive to climate warming and higher nutrient inputs. Thus, a better description of how forest managements such as nutrient fertilization impact soil carbon (C) and its temperature sensitivity is needed to better predict feedbacks between C cycling and climate. The temperature sensitivity of in situ soil C respiration was investigated in a boreal forest, which has received long-term nutrient fertilization (22years), and compared with the temperature sensitivity of C mineralization measured in the laboratory. We found that the fertilization treatment increased both the response of soil in situ CO2 effluxes to a warming treatment and the temperature sensitivity of C mineralization measured in the laboratory (Q(10)). These results suggested that soil C may be more sensitive to an increase in temperature in long-term fertilized in comparison with nutrient poor boreal ecosystems. Furthermore, the fertilization treatment modified the SOC content and the microbial community composition, but we found no direct relationship between either SOC or microbial changes and the temperature sensitivity of C mineralization. However, the relation between the soil C:N ratio and the fungal/bacterial ratio was changed in the combined warmed and fertilized treatment compared with the other treatments, which suggest that strong interaction mechanisms may occur between nutrient input and warming in boreal soils. Further research is needed to unravel into more details in how far soil organic matter and microbial community composition changes are responsible for the change in the temperature sensitivity of soil C under increasing mineral N inputs. Such research would help to take into account the effect of fertilization managements on soil C storage in C cycling numerical models.",
636,excluded,Effects of cover crops on multiple ecosystem services: ten meta-analyses of data from arable farmland in california and the mediterranean,"Cover crops are considered to be beneficial for multiple ecosystem services, and they have been widely promoted through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the EU and Farm Bill Conservation Title Programs, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), in the USA. However, it can be difficult to decide whether the beneficial effects of cover crops on some ecosystem services are likely to outweigh their harmful effects on other services, and thus to decide whether they should be promoted by agricultural policy in specific situations. We used meta-analysis to quantify the effects of cover crops on five ecosystem services (food production, climate regulation, soil and water regulation, and weed control) in arable farmland in California and the Mediterranean, based on 326 experiments reported in 57 publications. In plots with cover crops, there was 13% less water, 9% more organic matter and 41% more microbial biomass in the soil, 27% fewer weeds, and 15% higher carbon dioxide emissions (but also more carbon stored in soil organic matter), compared to control plots with bare soils or winter fallows. Cash crop yields were 16% higher in plots that had legumes as cover crops (compared to controls) but 7% lower in plots that had non-legumes as cover crops. Soil nitrogen content was 41% lower, and nitrate leaching was 53% lower, in plots that had non-legume cover crops (compared to controls) but not significantly different in plots that had legumes. We did not find enough data to quantify the effects of cover crops on biodiversity conservation, pollination, or pest regulation. These gaps in the evidence need to be closed if cover crops continue to be widely promoted. We suggest that this novel combination of multiple meta-analyses for multiple ecosystem services could be used to support multi-criteria decision making about agri-environmental policy.",Catch crops; Conservation agriculture; Conservation evidence; Conservation practices; Evidence synthesis; Green manures
637,excluded,Stakeholder theory classification: a theoretical and empirical evaluation of definitions,"Stakeholder theory is widely accepted but elementary aspects remain indeterminate as the term 'stakeholder' is an essentially contested concept (Miles, J Bus Ethics 108:285-298, 2012; Mitchell, Organ Stud 33:1407-1411, 2012), being variously describable, internally complex and open in character (Gallie, Proc Aristot Soc 56:167-198, 1956). Such contestability is highly problematic for theory development and empirical testing. The extent of essential contestability, previously unknown, is demonstrated in this paper through a bounded systematic review of 593 different stakeholder theory definitions. As an essentially contested concept, the solution does not lie in a universal stakeholder definition, but in debating the boundaries of stakeholder identification. To this end, this paper presents the first major attempt at sorting, filtering and ordering stakeholder theory and stakeholder definitions to produce a comprehensive, multi-dimensional classification of stakeholder theory. The constructs of the classification model juxtapose existing stakeholder theories and contributions from across the multi-contextual applications of stakeholder theory, thereby providing an invaluable overview of what we know about stakeholder theory in one model. The classification model is then tested with positive results. The paper concludes with a comprehensive discussion of the implications of classification stakeholder theory definitions, which has for future research.",Classification; Essentially contested concepts; Stakeholder classification; Stakeholder definitions; Stakeholder identification; Stakeholder theory
638,included,"Impacts of elevated N inputs on north temperate forest soil C storage, C/N, and net N-mineralization","Nitrogen (N) availability influences carbon (C) storage in forest soils through effects on plant growth, litter production, and soil C decomposition and stabilization. Soil C/N and net N-mineralization are commonly reported empirical measures of soil N availability, and changes in these variables due to N inputs may feed back to soil C storage through a variety of biotic and abiotic pathways. We conducted a meta-analysis of the responses of soil C storage, C/N, and net N-mineralization (N-min) to N inputs in north temperate forests. The modes of N addition we considered were the establishment of N-fixing vegetation (N-fix), N-fertilization (N-fert), and simulated chronic N deposition (N-dep). Overall, N inputs increased soil C (+7.7%) and N-min (+62%), while decreasing C/N (-4.9%). Soil C concentrations and C storage (pool sizes) responded similarly to N inputs, although increased soil C storage occurred only in the mineral soil (+12.2%). C/N shifts were restricted to the forest floor (-7.8%), whereas forest floor and mineral soil N-min responses to N inputs were very similar (+61% and +64%, respectively). Significant between-study variation in the effects of N inputs on soil parameters was related to the mode of N addition, biogeographic factors, and time. Temporal relationships between N inputs and soil response parameters suggested that increases in forest floor and mineral soil N-min were large but transient, and were followed by decadal-scale changes in forest floor C/N and mineral soil C storage. Temporal patterns present in the dataset could have been due to changes in soil organic matter decomposition and stabilization, or increased plant productivity and litter inputs. In either case, the results of this study quantitatively demonstrate that managing forest N supply affects N availability and soil C storage, and highlight the importance of long-term measurements for accurately assessing the effects of N inputs on forest soils.

Precipitation across the globe is predicted to change more intensively under future climate change scenarios, but the resulting impact on plant roots remains unclear. Based on 154 observations from experiments in which precipitation was manipulated in the field and root biomass was measured, we investigated responses in fine-root biomass of herbaceous and woody plants to alterations in precipitation. We found that root biomass of herbaceous and woody plants responded differently to precipitation change. In particular, precipitation increase consistently enhanced fine-root biomass of woody plants but had variable effects on herb roots in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. In contrast, precipitation decrease reduced root biomass of herbaceous plants but not woody plants. In addition, with precipitation alteration, the magnitude of root responses was greater in dry areas than in wet areas. Together, these results indicate that herbaceous and woody plants have different rooting strategies to cope with altered precipitation regimes, particularly in water-limited ecosystems. These findings suggest that root responses to precipitation change may critically influence root productivity and soil carbon dynamics under future climate change scenarios.",drought; fine roots; plant functional type; precipitation increase; rainfall; root biomass; root production
640,excluded,Effects of agricultural intensification on soil biodiversity and implications for ecosystem functioning: a meta-analysis,"Environmental perturbations such as agricultural intensification may alter soil biodiversity in a manner that affects ecosystem functioning, but links are not well quantified. With this review we ask: (1) ""How does agricultural intensification affect soil biodiversity?"" and (2) ""How do such changes in soil biodiversity affect ecosystem function?"" We used meta-analysis to quantify responses across studies. Our results indicate that agricultural intensification can significantly alter soil biodiversity, with negative impacts of synthetic N fertilization on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) and faunal diversity, and positive effects on fungal-and microbial functional diversity. Bacterial diversity increased with low synthetic N input rates (<150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), with organic N inputs, and when application duration was >5 years, suggesting that agricultural management practices that promote soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation and retention enhance bacterial biodiversity. Tillage negatively impacted soil faunal and bacterial diversity, but did not affect AMF, fungal or functional diversity, and organic farming relative to conventional farming did not affect soil biodiversity. Biodiversity manipulation studies indicate that changes in soil biodiversity affect ecosystem process rates, although manipulated biodiversity levels tend to exaggerate biodiversity losses and possibly overestimate consequences for ecosystem functioning relative to measured biodiversity losses from environmental perturbations. There is a need for more studies that evaluate how losses in soil biodiversity following environmental perturbations directly affect ecosystem functioning. Advances in analytical techniques to identify soil organisms and an increase in soil biodiversity manipulation experiments should help solidify links between environmental changes, soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.",
641,excluded,The change of soil carbon stocks and fine root dynamics after land use change from a native pasture to a pine plantation,"A published meta-analysis of worldwide data showed soil carbon decreasing following land use change from pasture to conifer plantation. A paired site (a native pasture with Themeda triandra dominant, and an adjacent Pinus radiata plantation planted onto the pasture 16 years ago) was set up as a case study to assess the soil carbon reduction and the possible reason for the reduction under pine, including the change in fine root (diameter <2 mm) dynamics (production and mortality). Soil analysis confirmed that soil carbon and nitrogen stocks to 100 cm under the plantation were significantly less than under the pasture by 20 and 15%, respectively. A 36% greater mass of fine root was found in the soil under the pasture than under the plantation and the length of fine root was about nine times greater in the pasture. Much less fine root length was produced and roots died more slowly under the plantation than under the pasture based on observations of fine root dynamics in minirhizotrons. The annual inputs of fine root litter to the top 100 cm soil, estimated from soil coring and minirhizotron observations, were 6.3 Mg dry matter ha(-1) year(-1) (containing 2.7 Mg C and 38.9 kg N) under the plantation, and 9.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) (containing 3.6 Mg C and 81.4 kg N) under the pasture. The reduced amount of carbon, following afforestation of the pasture, in each depth-layer of the soil profile correlated with the lower length of dead fine roots in the layer under the plantation compared with the pasture. This correlation was consistent with the hypothesis that the soil carbon reduction after land use change from pasture to conifer plantation might be related to change of fine root dynamics, at least in part.",
642,excluded,"Soil nitrogen transformations under populus tremuloides, betula papyrifera and acer saccharum following 3 years exposure to elevated co2 and o-3","Increases in atmospheric CO2 and tropospheric O-3 may affect forest N cycling by altering plant litter production and the availability of substrates for microbial metabolism. Three years following the establishment of our free-air CO2-O-3 enrichment experiment, plant growth has been stimulated by elevated CO2 resulting in greater substrate input to soil; elevated O-3 has counteracted this effect. We hypothesized that rates of soil N cycling would be enhanced by greater plant productivity under elevated CO2, and that CO2 effects would be dampened by O-3. We found that elevated CO2 did not alter gross N transformation rates. Elevated O-3 significantly reduced gross N mineralization and microbial biomass N, and effects were consistent among species. We also observed significant interactions between CO2 and O-3: (i) gross N mineralization was greater under elevated CO2 (1.0 mg N kg(-1) day(-1)) than in the presence of both CO2 and O-3 (0.5 mg N kg(-1) day(-1)) and (ii) gross NH4+ immobilization was also greater under elevated CO2 (0.8 mg N kg(-1) day(-1)) than under CO2 plus O-3 (0.4 mg N kg(-1) day(-1)). We used a laboratory N-15 tracer method to quantify transfer of inorganic N to organic pools. Elevated CO2 led to greater recovery of NH4+-N-15 in microbial biomass and corresponding lower recovery in the extractable NO3- pool. Elevated CO2 resulted in a substantial increase in NO3--N-15 recovery in soil organic matter. We observed no O-3 main effect and no CO2 by O-3 interaction effect on N-15 recovery in any soil pool. All of the above responses were most pronounced beneath Betula papyrifera and Populus tremuloides, which have grown more rapidly than Acer saccharum. Although elevated CO2 has increased plant productivity, the resulting increase in plant litter production has yet to overcome the influence of the pre-existing pool of soil organic matter on soil microbial activity and rates of N cycling. Ozone reduces plant litter inputs and also appears to affect the composition of plant litter in a way that reduces microbial biomass and activity.",
643,excluded,Carbon outcomes of major land-cover transitions in se asia: great uncertainties and redd plus policy implications,"Policy makers across the tropics propose that carbon finance could provide incentives for forest frontier communities to transition away from swidden agriculture (slash-and-burn or shifting cultivation) to other systems that potentially reduce emissions and/or increase carbon sequestration. However, there is little certainty regarding the carbon outcomes of many key land-use transitions at the center of current policy debates. Our meta-analysis of over 250 studies reporting above- and below-ground carbon estimates for different land-use types indicates great uncertainty in the net total ecosystem carbon changes that can be expected from many transitions, including the replacement of various types of swidden agriculture with oil palm, rubber, or some other types of agroforestry systems. These transitions are underway throughout Southeast Asia, and are at the heart of REDD+ debates. Exceptions of unambiguous carbon outcomes are the abandonment of any type of agriculture to allow forest regeneration (a certain positive carbon outcome) and expansion of agriculture into mature forest (a certain negative carbon outcome). With respect to swiddening, our meta-analysis supports a reassessment of policies that encourage land-cover conversion away from these [especially long-fallow] systems to other more cash-crop-oriented systems producing ambiguous carbon stock changes – including oil palm and rubber. In some instances, lengthening fallow periods of an existing swidden system may produce substantial carbon benefits, as would conversion from intensely cultivated lands to high-biomass plantations and some other types of agroforestry. More field studies are needed to provide better data of above- and below-ground carbon stocks before informed recommendations or policy decisions can be made regarding which land-use regimes optimize or increase carbon sequestration. As some transitions may negatively impact other ecosystem services, food security, and local livelihoods, the entire carbon and noncarbon benefit stream should also be taken into account before prescribing transitions with ambiguous carbon benefits.","farmland, plantation, forest   "
644,excluded,Searching for genes that matter in acute kidney injury: a systematic review,"Background and Objectives: Identifying patients who may develop acute kidney injury (AKI) remains challenging, as clinical determinants explain only a portion of individual risk. Another factor that likely affects risk is intrinsic genetic variability. Therefore, a systematic review of studies was performed that related the development or prognosis of AKI to genetic variation. Design, setting, participants, and measurements: MEDLINE, EMBASE, HuGEnet, SCOPUS, and Web of Science were searched for articles from 1950 to Dec 2007. Two independent researchers screened articles using predetermined criteria. Studies were assessed for methodological quality via an aggregate scoring system. Results: The 16 included studies were of cohort or case-cohort design and investigated 35 polymorphisms in 21 genes in association with AKI. Fifteen gene-gene interactions were also investigated in four separate studies. Study populations were primarily premature infants or adults who were critically ill or postcardiac bypass patients. Among the studies, five different definitions of AKI were used. Only one polymorphism, APO E e2/e3/e4, had greater than one study showing a significant impact (P < 0.05) on AKI incidence. The mean quality score of 5.8/10 (range four to nine), heterogeneity in the studies, and the dearth of studies precluded additional meta-analysis of the results. Conclusions: Current association studies are unable to provide definitive evidence linking genetic variation to AKI. Future success will require a narrow consensus definition of AKI, rigorous epidemiologic techniques, and a shift from a priori hypothesis-driven to genome-wide association studies.

645,excluded,Climate change effects on livestock in the northeast us and strategies for adaptation,"The livestock industries are a major contributor to the economy of the northeastern United States. Climate models predict increased average maximum temperatures, days with temperatures exceeding 25 A degrees C, and higher annual precipitation in the Northeast. These environmental changes combined with increased atmospheric CO2 concentration are expected to either increase or decrease forage productivity depending on the crop, and may decrease protein content and forage digestibility. Winter damage to sensitive forage species may also increase. Predicted temperature increases are expected to reduce fertility in dairy cattle and heat stress-induced inflammation may limit energy available for productive functions. Additional loss in milk production due to decreased feed intake is estimated to be up to 1% of the projected annual milk production through 2100. The effects of climate change on the beef industry in the Northeast are expected to be minimal. Broiler production in the region may benefit from warmer winter and summer temperatures, but future housing will require greater insulation and ventilation fan capacity. Providing adequate housing and ventilation to offset climate changes will also be important for the layer industry and will likely increase the price of eggs. Climate change is expected to have an economic impact on the horse industry in the region through additional management of land and forage resources, building of shelters, and heat abatement at equine events. Increased temperatures and more intense storms will increase nutrient losses and gaseous emissions from animal manure. Uncertainties about how host animals, pathogens, and disease vectors will respond to climate change highlight the need for continued animal health monitoring.",
646,included,Controls over soil microbial biomass responses to carbon amendments in agricultural systems: A meta-analysis,"Soil microbial biomass (MB) facilitates key ecosystem functions such as soil aggregation and nutrient cycling and makes a substantial contribution to soil organic matter. While agricultural conversion drastically reduces MB, the use of organic amendments is an effective way to rebuild depleted MB. Yet, little is known about broad-scale, global controls over MB responses to organic inputs. We used a meta-analysis to identify the degree to which soil properties, agricultural management, and geographic location regulate MB response (carbon, C(mic); nitrogen, N(mic); and C:N ratio, C:N(mic)) to animal manure-based inputs relative to inorganic fertilizers. We show that organic amendments increased C(mic) by 36% and N(mic) by 27% across all observations. The chemistry of amendments and their application rates were the strongest regulators of C(mic) but edaphic properties were also important. C:N(mic) averaged 8.6 and was not influenced by organic amendments under any conditions, providing evidence that the physiological requirements of microbes, rather than management or environmental factors, constrain their elemental stoichiometry. Our study indicates that even small quantities of organic amendments can be used to rapidly restore MB across a range of cropping systems but specific responses depend upon the type and rate of inputs as well soil characteristics.

647,excluded,FUNGAL SYMBIONTS ALTER PLANT RESPONSES TO GLOBAL CHANGE,"NAWhile direct plant responses to global change have been well characterized, indirect plant responses to global change, via altered species interactions, have received less attention. Here, we examined how plants associated with four classes of fungal symbionts (class I leaf endophytes [EF], arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF], ectomycorrhizal fungi [ECM], and dark septate endophytes [DSE]) responded to four global change factors (enriched CO2, drought, N deposition, and warming). We performed a meta‐analysis of 434 studies spanning 174 publications to search for generalizable trends in responses of plant–fungal symbioses to future environments. Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (1) Can fungal symbionts ameliorate responses of plants to global change? (2) Do fungal symbiont groups differ in the degree to which they modify plant response to global change? (3) Do particular global change factors affect plant–fungal symbioses more than others? In all global change scenarios, except elevated CO2, fungal symbionts significantly altered plant responses to global change. In most cases, fungal symbionts increased plant biomass in response to global change. However, increased N deposition reduced the benefits of symbiosis. Of the global change factors we considered, drought and N deposition resulted in the strongest fungal mediation of plant responses. Our analysis highlighted gaps in current knowledge for responses of particular fungal groups and revealed the importance of considering not only the nonadditive effects of multiple global change factors, but also the interactive effects of multiple fungal symbioses. Our results show that considering plant–fungal symbioses is critical to predicting ecosystem response to global change.",plants associated with fungal symbionts
648,excluded,"A global assessment of holistic planned grazing (tm) compared with season-long, continuous grazing: meta-analysis findings","It has been claimed that Holistic Planned Grazing (TM) (HPG), a type of rotational grazing, can increase productivity in rangelands and reverse climate change while doubling the stocking rate, mainly through the impact of densely bunched animals on primary production. Previous reviews have found similar or greater plant and animal production in continuous (season-long) compared with rotational grazing. Here season-long continuous grazing is compared with HPG alone to explore the evidence for animal impact. Three quantitative meta-analysis models were used to assess data sets from literature between 1972 and 2016. Weighted mean differences (effect sizes) between HPG and continuous grazing showed that there was no difference in plant basal cover, plant biomass and animal gain responses (p > 0.05). Thus, from the balance of studies, if animal impact is occurring during HPG, it has no effect on production. As interesting as the overall result is the significant between-study heterogeneity assessed using Cochran's Q (p = 0.007 to < 0.0001). Studies with positive effect sizes tended to have higher precipitation (p < 0.05), suggesting that only some rangelands have the resources to support HPG. Furthermore, there is scope for investigating the impact of HPG on socio-ecological aspects of rangelands, such as management.",animal density; aridity index; biodiversity; Holistic Planned Grazing (TM); rotational grazing
649,excluded,Comparisons between oral anticoagulants among older nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients,"OBJECTIVES Older adult patients are underrepresented in clinical trials comparing non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin. This subgroup analysis of the ARISTOPHANES study used multiple data sources to compare the risk of stroke/systemic embolism (SE) and major bleeding (MB) among very old patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) prescribed NOACs or warfarin. DESIGN Retrospective observational study. SETTING The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and three US commercial claims databases. PARTICIPANTS A total of 88 582 very old (aged >= 80 y) NVAF patients newly initiating apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or warfarin from January 1, 2013, to September 30, 2015. MEASUREMENTS In each database, six 1:1 propensity score matched (PSM) cohorts were created for each drug comparison. Patient cohorts were pooled from all four databases after PSM. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of stroke/SE and MB. RESULTS The patients in the six matched cohorts had a mean follow-up time of 7 to 9 months. Compared with warfarin, apixaban (HR = .58; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .49-.69), dabigatran (HR = .77; 95% CI = .60-.99), and rivaroxaban (HR = .74; 95% CI = .65-.85) were associated with lower risks of stroke/SE. For MB, apixaban (HR = .60; 95% CI = .54-.67) was associated with a lower risk; dabigatran (HR = .92; 95% CI = .78-1.07) was associated with a similar risk, and rivaroxaban (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.07-1.24) was associated with a higher risk compared with warfarin. Apixaban was associated with a lower risk of stroke/SE and MB compared with dabigatran (stroke/SE: HR = .65; 95% CI = .47-.89; MB: HR = .60; 95% CI = .49-.73) and rivaroxaban (stroke/SE: HR = .72; 95% CI = .59-.86; MB: HR = .50; 95% CI = .45-.55). Dabigatran was associated with a lower risk of MB (HR = .77; 95% CI = .67-.90) compared with rivaroxaban. CONCLUSION Among very old NVAF patients, NOACs were associated with lower rates of stroke/SE and varying rates of MB compared with warfarin.

650,included,Soil carbon stock change following afforestation in Northern Europe: a meta-analysis,"Northern Europe supports large soil organic carbon (SOC) pools and has been subjected to high frequency of land-use changes during the past decades. However, this region has not been well represented in previous large-scale syntheses of land-use change effects on SOC, especially regarding effects of afforestation. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of SOC stock change following afforestation in Northern Europe. Response ratios were calculated for forest floors and mineral soils (0-10 cm and 0-20/30 cm layers) based on paired control (former land use) and afforested plots. We analyzed the influence of forest age, former land-use, forest type, and soil textural class. Three major improvements were incorporated in the meta-analysis: analysis of major interaction groups, evaluation of the influence of nonindependence between samples according to study design, and mass correction. Former land use was a major factor contributing to changes in SOC after afforestation. In former croplands, SOC change differed between soil layers and was significantly positive (20%) in the 0-10 cm layer. Afforestation of former grasslands had a small negative (nonsignificant) effect indicating limited SOC change following this land-use change within the region. Forest floors enhanced the positive effects of afforestation on SOC, especially with conifers. Meta-estimates calculated for the periods <30 years and >30 years since afforestation revealed a shift from initial loss to later gain of SOC. The interaction group analysis indicated that meta-estimates in former land-use, forest type, and soil textural class alone were either offset or enhanced when confounding effects among variable classes were considered. Furthermore, effect sizes were slightly overestimated if sample dependence was not accounted for and if no mass correction was performed. We conclude that significant SOC sequestration in Northern Europe occurs after afforestation of croplands and not grasslands, and changes are small within a 30-year perspective.",meta-analysis; climatic change. duff. flooring. organic matter in soil. reafforestation. reforestation.

The aim of this study is to examine the potential patient- and procedure-related risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis in a prospective multicenter study. METHODS: A 160-variable database was prospectively collected by a defined protocol on patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic ERCP at 15 centers in the Midwest Pancreaticobiliary Group and participating in a randomized controlled study evaluating whether prophylactic corticosteroids will reduce the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Data were collected prior to the procedure, at the time of procedure, and 24-72 h after discharge. Post-ERCP pancreatitis was diagnosed and its severity graded according to consensus criteria. RESULTS: Of the 1,115 patients enrolled, diagnostic ERCP with or without sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM) was performed in 536 (48.1%) and therapeutic ERCP in 579 (51.9%). Suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) was the indication for the ERCP in 378 patients (33.9%). Pancreatitis developed in 168 patients (15.1%) and was graded mild in 112 (10%), moderate in 45 (4%), and severe in 11(1%). There was no difference in the incidence of pancreatitis or the frequency of investigated potential pancreatitis risk factors between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. By univariate analysis, the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis was significantly higher in 19 of 30 investigated variables. In the multivariate risk model, significant risk factors with adjusted odds ratios (OR) were: minor papilla sphincterotomy (OR: 3.8), suspected SOD (OR: 2.6), history of post-ERCP pancreatitis (OR: 2.0), age < 60 yr (OR: 1.6), >= 2 contrast injections into the pancreatic duct (OR: 1.5), and trainee involvement (OR: 1.5). Female gender, history of recurrent idiopathic pancreatitis, pancreas divisum, SOM, difficult cannulation, and major papilla sphincterotomy (either biliary or pancreatic) were not multivariate risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis. CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the role of patient factors (age, SOD, prior history of post-ERCP pancreatitis) and technical factors (number of PD injections, minor papilla sphincterotomy, and operator experience) as the determining high-risk predictors for post-ERCP pancreatitis.",

654,excluded,A salutogenic interpretation of the ottawa charter,"Twenty years have passed since the philosophy and principals were formulated in the Ottawa Charter for health promotion. A critical reflection of the content and success of the Ottawa Charter was published before the IUHPE World Conference in Vancover in June 2007. This paper contextualizes and discusses Salutogenesis and Antonovsky in the development of health promotion practice and research and, further, relates the salutogenic concept Sense of Coherence (SOC) to the Ottawa Charter. An overview of the development of health promotion and the salutogenic theory of health is presented. In addition, this is illustrated in a new way using the metaphors of 'health in the river of life' and 'SOC in a life course perspective'. Health promotion, including the Ottawa charter, lacks a clear theoretical foundation. The results of a systematic review of salutogenic research are used to demonstrate how the salutogenic framework could support the philosophical and practical intentions of the OC. The salutogenic model contributes to the maintenance and development of health and quality of life (QoL), i.e. the process and outcome of the principles of the OC. The metaphor of the river and the life cycle are new ways of demonstrating the paradigm shift provided by the Salutogenesis and health promotion in relation to public health and medicine. The salutogenic theory is an important contribution to the theory base of health promotion research and practice.",
655,included,Regulation of soil CO2 and N2O emissions by cover crops: A meta-analysis,"Cover crops provide multiple agronomic and environmental benefits, such as enhanced soil carbon sequestration, aggregation, water infiltration, and reduced erosion and nutrient leaching compared with no cover crop. However, little is known regarding the effect of cover crop species, biomass quality and quantity, and method of residue placement on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using meta-analysis, this study examined the effect of cover crop species, quality and quantity of biomass, and residue management on response ratios (RRs) of cover crops to no cover crop on CO2 and N2O emissions following cash crops. All cover crop species increased CO2 emissions, but reduced N2O emissions compared with no cover crop, except legumes which increased N2O emissions. Cover crop biomass explained 63% of variability in increased CO2 emissions and 55% of variability in decreased N2O emissions. Both CO2 and N2O emissions decreased polynomially with increased cover crop biomass C/N ratio, with greater rate of decline for legumes than nonlegumes. Cover crop residue incorporated into the soil increased CO2 and N2O emissions compared with the residue placed at surface or removed from the soil. Cover crops emitted lower CO2 and N2O emissions than no cover crops in silty loam and sandy clay loam soils, respectively, compared to clay loam and silty clay loam soils. Both soil organic carbon and total nitrogen increased with cover crop compared to no cover crop. Although CO2 and N2O emissions varied with cover crop species, using legume and nonlegume cover crop mixture to enhance residue C/N ratio compared to legumes and placing the residue at the surface instead of incorporating into the soil can reduce GHG emissions. Because of enhanced soil C and N storage and other known benefits, improvement in soil health and environmental quality due to cover crop may outweigh CO2 emissions compared to no cover crop.",croplands
656,excluded,Hypertension treatment and control and risk of falls in older women,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES A lower risk of falls is commonly cited as a reason to treat hypertension conservatively in older individuals. We examined the effect of hypertension treatment and control status and measured blood pressure (BP) level on the risk of falls in older women. DESIGN/SETTING Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS A total of 5971 women (mean age 79 years; 50.4% white, 33.1% black, 16.5% Hispanic/Latina) enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative and Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health study. MEASUREMENTS BP was measured by trained nurses, and hypertension treatment was assessed by medication inventory. Participants mailed in monthly calendars to self-report falls for 1 year. RESULTS Overall, 70% of women had hypertension at baseline (53% treated and controlled, 12% treated and uncontrolled, 5% untreated). There were 2582 women (43%) who reported falls in the 1 year of surveillance. Compared with nonhypertensive women, when adjusted for fall risk factors and lower limb physical function, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for falls was 0.82 (confidence interval [CI] = 0.74-0.92) in women with treated controlled hypertension (p = .0008) and 0.73 (CI = 0.62-0.87) in women with treated uncontrolled hypertension (p = .0004). Neither measured systolic nor diastolic BP was associated with falls in the overall cohort. In women treated with antihypertensive medication, higher diastolic BP was associated with a lower risk of falls in a model adjusted for fall risk factors (IRR = 0.993 per mm Hg; 95% CI = 0.987-1.000; p = .04). The only class of antihypertensive medication associated with an increased risk of falls compared with all other types of antihypertensive drugs was beta-blockers. CONCLUSION Women in this long-term research study with treated hypertension had a lower risk of falls compared with nonhypertensive women.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to assess the effect of different intensities of RRT on all-cause mortality and renal recovery in AKI patients. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library database were systematically searched for trials published between 1950 and 2009. Inclusion criteria were completed, prospective, adult-population, randomized controlled studies. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Summary estimates of RR were obtained using a random effects model. Heterogeneity, metaregression, publication bias, and subgroup analyses were conducted. Results: Eight trials were identified that provided data on 3841 patients and 1808 deaths. More intense RRT (35 to 48 ml/kg per h or equivalent) had no overall effect on the risk of death (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.04, P = 0.143) or recovery of renal function (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.31, P = 0.181) compared with less-intensive regimens (20 to 25 ml/kg per h or equivalent). Significant heterogeneity was identified with contributing factors including publication year (P = 0.004) and Jadad score (P = 0.048). Conclusions: Within the intensity ranges studied, higher intensity RRT does not reduce mortality rates or improve renal recovery among patients with AKI. The results do not negate the importance of RRT intensity in the treatment of AKI patients but rather reinforce the need to better understand the effects of treatment modalities, doses, and timing in this varied, high-risk population.

658,excluded,"Laboratory, field and airborne spectroscopy for monitoring organic carbon content in agricultural soils","The temporal evolution in Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) content is often used in estimations of greenhouse gas fluxes and is an important indicator of soil quality. Regional estimates of SOC changes can only be obtained by analyzing very large number of samples over large areas due to the strong spatial variability in SOC contents. Visible and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (VNIRS) provides an alternative to chemical analyses. The benefits of this technique include a reduction of the sampling processing time, an increase of the number of samples that can be analyzed within time and budget constraints and hence an improvement of the detection of small changes in SOC stocks for a given area. Carbon contents are predicted from spectra through Partial Least Square Regressions (PLSR). The performance of three different instrumental settings (laboratory, field and airborne spectroscopy) has been assessed and their relative advantages for soil monitoring studies have been outlined using the concept of Minimal Detectable Difference. It appears that ground-based spectrometers give Root Mean Square Errors of Cross-Validation similar to the limit of repeatability of a routine SOC analytical technique such as the Walkley and Black method (+/- 1 g C kg(-1)). The airborne spectrometer, despite its greater potential to cover large areas during a single flight campaign, has some difficulties to reach such values due to a lower Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Because of its statistical nature, the method and its potential rely on the stability of the calibrations obtained. It appears that calibrations are currently site-specific due to variation in soil type and surface condition. However, it is shown that PLSR can take into account both soil and spectral variation caused by different measuring campaigns and study areas. Further research is needed to develop regional spectral libraries in order to be able to use VNIRS as a robust analytical technique for precisely determining the SOC content and its spatial variation.

659,excluded,"Using meta-analyses to assess pedo-variability under different land uses and soil management in central Ohio, USA","The conflicting information on the impacts of management on spatial and temporal soil quality changes necessitates a comprehensive approach that can combine soil property data into a credible soil quality index. Thus, a field study was conducted to demonstrate an application of meta-analytic methods to integrate and quantitatively describe the effects of management practices on key soil physical and chemical properties which influence soil quality. Soil samples were obtained during spring 2012 from 5 sites within Ohio, USA, at a similar landscape position under conventional tillage (CT), no-till (NT), and natural vegetation (NV) land uses. Soil samples from 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm depths were analyzed for determination of total soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, bulk density (rho(b)), available water capacity (AWC), electrical conductivity (EC), and pH. These data were compared using analyses of variance (ANOVA), and the Odds Ratio (OR) from the DerSimonian-Liard (DSL) meta-analysis model. The OR is the ratio of a statistical test being positive relative to being falsely positive. There were significant differences in the soil properties for each site, depth, management, except for AWC and pH which were similar under three land uses and management. The SOC, pH, EC did not vary with site x depth, and management x depth interactions. Soil under CT had a lower OR than that under NT for SOC (0.57), pH (0.81), rho(b) (0.84), and AWC (0.69). However, the OR for EC followed an opposite trend, being higher in soil under CT than NT (1.36). Based on the meta-analyses which provide a systematic comparative assessment within the whole profile, the data support the conclusion that soils under CT are of a relatively lower quality than those under NT because they have lower SOC and AWC, but higher EC.

660,included,Soil carbon sequestration and land use change associated with biofuel production: empirical evidence,"Abstract Soil organic carbon (SOC) change can be a major impact of land use change (LUC) associated with biofuel feedstock production. By collecting and analyzing data from worldwide field observations of major LUCs from cropland, grassland, and forest to lands producing biofuel crops (i.e. corn, switchgrass, Miscanthus, poplar, and willow), we were able to estimate SOC response ratios and sequestration rates and evaluate the effects of soil depth and time scale on SOC change. Both the amount and rate of SOC change were highly dependent on the specific land transition. Irrespective of soil depth or time horizon, cropland conversions resulted in an overall SOC gain of 6–14% relative to initial SOC level, while conversion from grassland or forest to corn (without residue removal) or poplar caused significant carbon loss (9–35%). No significant SOC changes were observed in land converted from grasslands or forests to switchgrass, Miscanthus, or willow. The SOC response ratios were similar in both 0–30 and 0–100 cm soil depths in most cases, suggesting SOC changes in deep soil and that use of top soil only for SOC accounting in biofuel life cycle analysis (LCA) might underestimate total SOC changes. Soil carbon sequestration rates varied greatly among studies and land transition types. Generally, the rates of SOC change tended to be the greatest during the 10 years following land conversion and had declined to approach 0 within about 20 years for most LUCs. Observed trends in SOC change were generally consistent with previous reports. Soil depth and duration of study significantly influence SOC change rates and so should be considered in carbon emission accounting in biofuel LCA. High uncertainty remains for many perennial systems and forest transitions, additional field trials, and modeling efforts are needed to draw conclusions about the site- and system-specific rates and direction of change.",corn; cropland; emission factor; forest; grassland; life cycle analysis; Miscanthus; poplar; switchgrass; willow
661,included,A global synthesis reveals more response sensitivity of soil carbon flux than pool to warming,"Purpose Climate change continues to garner attention in the public sphere. Most recognize its potential to affect global carbon (C) dynamics in the biosphere. Many posit that global warming promotes the decomposition of soil organic C (SOC) and increases soil C release. However, it remains unclear how soil C dynamics respond to different influencing factors (e.g., warming method, magnitude/duration, mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP)) across ecosystems on a global scale. Materials and methods Here, we performed a meta-analysis to identify the general global patterns of how warming impacts soil C dynamics. Results and discussion Across all terrestrial ecosystems, warming reduced SOC by 4.96% and stimulated soil microbial biomass C (MBC), soil respiration (SR), and heterotrophic respiration (HR) by 6.30, 14.56, and 8.42%, respectively. Warming affected soil C pools in grasslands and soil C fluxes in forests. The changes in SOC did not correlate to warming magnitude/duration or climate factors (MAT and MAP). However, changes in both MBC and SR did correlate to warming magnitude/duration and MAT. The changes in HR showed a quadratic response to warming magnitude and a linear response to MAP. Open-top chamber method can effectively affect soil C pools. SR proved to be more sensitive than HR to most warming methods. Conclusions Our results showed that soil C release exhibited more sensitivity to warming magnitude/duration or MAT/MAP than did net soil C sequestration. These results indicate that warming induces accelerated transition of soils from C sink to C source. Furthermore, they show the potential for global warming effects to exacerbate the positive feedback loop in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the declining rates-of-change in SR and HR under high magnitude warming may mitigate the positive feedback. Our analyses can improve the predictions of feedback between atmospheric and soil C pools.",Carbon cycle; Global warming; Soil carbon pools; Soil carbon fluxes; Terrestrial ecosystems
662,excluded,More haste less speed: a meta-analysis of thinking latencies during planning in people with psychosis,"Cognitive impairment is a core feature of psychosis, with slowed processing speed thought to be a prominent impairment in schizophrenia and first-episode psychosis. However, findings from the Stockings of Cambridge (SOC) planning task suggest changes in processing speed associated with the illness may include faster responses in early stages of planning, though findings are inconsistent. This review uses meta-analytic methods to assess thinking times in psychosis across the available literature. Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Eligibility criteria: 1) included a sample of people with non-affective psychosis according to DSM III, DSM IV, DSM V or ICD-10 criteria; 2) employed the SOC task; 3) included a healthy control group; and 4) published in English. We identified 11 studies that employed the SOC task. Results show that people with psychosis have significantly faster initial thinking times than non-clinical participants, but significantly slower subsequent thinking times during problem execution. These findings indicate that differences in processing speed are not limited to slower responses in people with psychosis but may reflect a preference for step-by-step processing rather than planning before task execution. We suggest this style of responding is adopted to compensate for working memory impairment.","Schizophrenia; Cognition; Executive function; Processing speed, CANTAB"

In particular, we aimed to use bacterial laccase-encoding genes as molecular markers for soil organic C cycling. Using rainfed olive farming as an experimental model, we determined the stability and accumulation levels of humic substances and applied these data to bacterial laccase-encoding gene expression and diversity in soils under four different agricultural management systems (bare soils under tillage/no tillage and vegetation cover under chemical/mechanical management). Materials and Methods: Humic C (>10(4) Da) was subjected to isoelectric focusing. The GC-MS method was used to analyze aromatic hydrocarbons. Real-Time PCR quantification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) for functional bacterial laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO)-encoding genes and transcripts were also carried out. Results: Soils under spontaneous vegetation, eliminated in springtime using mechanical methods for more than 30 years, showed the highest humic acid levels as well as the largest bacterial population rich in laccase genes and transcripts. The structure of the bacterial community based on LMCO genes also pointed to phylogenetic differences between these soils due to the impact of different management systems. Soils where herbicides were used to eliminate spontaneous vegetation once a year and those where pre-emergence herbicides resulted in bare soils clustered together for DNA-based DGGE analysis, which indicated a certain amount of microbial selection due to the application of herbicides. When LMCO-encoding gene expression was studied, soils where cover vegetation was managed either with herbicides or with mechanical methods showed less than 10% similarity, suggesting that the type of weed management strategy used can impact weed community composition and consequently laccase substrates derived from vegetation decay. Conclusions: We suggest that the low humic acid content retrieved in the herbicide-treated soils was mainly related to the type (due to vegetal cover specialization) and smaller quantity (due to lower vegetal biomass levels) of phenolic substrates for laccase enzymes involved in humification processes. We also found that spontaneous vegetal cover managed using mechanical methods could be the best option for achieving C stabilization in rainfed Mediterranean",C sequestration; Cover crops; Olive farming; Litter decomposition; Bacterial laccase; Humic acids
664,included,Agroforestry boosts soil health in the humid and sub-humid tropics: A meta-analysis,"Agroforestry has been increasingly recognized as a key example of agroecological praxis contributing to the sustainable intensification of food production while providing a number of additional benefits to society. However, a quantitative synthesis of the impact of agroforestry on soil health and associated ecosystem services in the humid and sub-humid tropics is still lacking. The objective of this study was to quantify the contribution of agroforestry practices to soil-mediated ecosystem services, specifically, regulation of soil erosion, storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N), availability of soil N and phosphorus (P) to crops, and alleviation of soil acidity across the humid and sub-humid tropics. The analysis demonstrated that agroforestry can reduce soil erosion rates by 50 % compared to crop monocultures. This finding is supported by higher infiltration rates, lower runoff, higher proportion of soil macroggregates, and greater stability of soil structure under agroforestry. SOC increased by 21 %, N storage increased by 13 %, available N by 46 % and available P by 11 % while soil pH increased by 2% under agroforestry compared to crop monocultures. We conclude that agroforestry can make significant contributions to provision of soil-mediated ecosystem services in the humid and sub-humid tropics.",Agroecology; Indicators; Soil health; Tropical agriculture
665,excluded,Soc sequestration as affected by historic and present management,"In 1978, after > 70 years of continuous management of the long-term fertilization experiment in Bad Lauchstadt, a general change of soil management was implemented for several treatments. Experimental plots which had previously received a high input of organic matter (OM) now received only low OM input and vice versa. The resulting changes of SOC concentrations on different treatments vary from -0.1 to +0.1 g kg(-1) yr(-1). These trends were analyzed in order to explain the observed variations with the mean carbon input together with the quality of the different sources to build up new SOC. The results showed that this quality related carbon flux from fresh organic matter (FOM) into SOC, here defined as ""carbon reproduction flux"" (C-rep), is a useful indicator to explain changes in SOC trends. Moreover, it can be used to predict the amount of FOM carbon input that is needed to achieve a given sequestration rate. The results revealed that carbon sequestration requires less effort on plots that had already higher carbon input rates in the past because the SOC storage, still far from the equilibrium state, had already a positive trend. Therefore, it is important to consider not only SOC stock but also the direction of the current trend when selecting measures that increase SOC to achieve the goal of the ""4%o Initiative: soils for food security and climate"" which was launched during the COP21 conference.",Soil organic carbon; Soil carbon reproduction; SOC trend prediction; Indicator
666,included,No-tillage lessens soil CO2 emissions the most under arid and sandy soil conditions: results from a meta-analysis,"The management of agroecosystems plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle with soil tillage leading to known organic carbon redistributions within soils and changes in soil CO2 emissions. Yet, discrepancies exist on the impact of tillage on soil CO2 emissions and on the main soil and environmental controls. A meta-analysis was conducted using 46 peer-reviewed publications totaling 174 paired observations comparing CO2 emissions over entire seasons or years from tilled and untilled soils across different climates, crop types and soil conditions with the objective of quantifying tillage impact on CO2 emissions and assessing the main controls. On average, tilled soils emitted 21aEuro-% more CO2 than untilled soils, which corresponded to a significant difference at P < 0.05. The difference increased to 29aEuro-% in sandy soils from arid climates with low soil organic carbon content (SOC(C)aEuro-< aEuro-1aEuro-%) and low soil moisture, but tillage had no impact on CO2 fluxes in clayey soils with high background SOCC (> aEuro-3aEuro-%). Finally, nitrogen fertilization and crop residue management had little effect on the CO2 responses of soils to no-tillage. These results suggest no-tillage is an effective mitigation measure of carbon dioxide losses from dry land soils. They emphasize the importance of including information on soil factors such as texture, aggregate stability and organic carbon content in global models of the carbon cycle.",croplands

Based on journal publications and a meta-analysis approach, this paper investigates the effects, and their spatiotemporal variations, of different land covers on red soil rehabilitation in China. Results indicate that all the land covers used in red soil rehabilitation had been effective in improving degraded red soils but the degrees of effectiveness varied. Soil organic carbon was the most sensitive of the three major soil nutrients considered with regard to land-cover change during ecological rehabilitation. Coniferous and broadleaf mixed forest was detected as the most effective land cover in red soil rehabilitation. Some spatiotemporal trends of land-cover effectiveness on red soil rehabilitation exist in a statistically significant sense. These findings are important for land use and ecological rehabilitation decision-making such as the selection of a soil rehabilitation pathway and the determination of priority areas for ecological rehabilitation.",ecological rehabilitation; land cover; meta-analysis; non-linearity; soil quality; spatiotemporal differentiation
668,excluded,Changes in soil phosphorus pools during prolonged arable cropping in semiarid grasslands,"It is assumed that land-use change has less effect on soil phosphorus (P) than on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Little is known, however, about the changes in soil P pools during prolonged arable cropping in semiarid grasslands. In this research, we measured changes in phosphorus pools of soil that had been cropped for 0-98 years in the South African Highveld. Hedley sequential extraction was carried out on bulk soil samples and size fractions to quantify inorganic and organic P pools along this temporal gradient. Total P content did not change with prolonged arable cropping, indicating that P removed by crops was compensated for by fertilizer application. The contributions of inorganic P (P-i) to the total P of bulk soil increased from 37 to 63%, with a corresponding decrease in organic P (P-o). After approximately 60 years of cultivation, a steady-state equilibrium was approached in all P fractions, which was characterized overall by smaller P-o and larger Pi contents. These temporal dynamics were controlled mainly by P pools in the sand fraction and by the 0.1 m NaOH pool from the Hedley fractionation. Increases in P-i may reflect inorganic fertilizer applications, whereas losses in P-o were attributed to crop harvest, erosion and mineralization of organic matter. Arable cropping affected both labile and stable P pools after land conversion, indicating that stable P pools were not mere sinks, but also slowly available sources of plant-available P.",
669,included,Impact of tropical land-use change on soil organic carbon stocks - a meta-analysis,"Land-use changes are the second largest source of human-induced greenhouse gas emission, mainly due to deforestation in the tropics and subtropics. CO(2) emissions result from biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and may be offset with afforestation programs. However, the effect of land-use changes on SOC is poorly quantified due to insufficient data quality (only SOC concentrations and no SOC stocks, shallow sampling depth) and representativeness. In a global meta-analysis, 385 studies on land-use change in the tropics were explored to estimate the SOC stock changes for all major land-use change types. The highest SOC losses were caused by conversion of primary forest into cropland (-25%) and perennial crops (-30%) but forest conversion into grassland also reduced SOC stocks by 12%. Secondary forests stored less SOC than primary forests (-9%) underlining the importance of primary forests for C stores. SOC losses are partly reversible if agricultural land is afforested (+29%) or under cropland fallow (+32%) and with cropland conversion into grassland (+26%). Data on soil bulk density are critical in order to estimate SOC stock changes because (i) the bulk density changes with land-use and needs to be accounted for when calculating SOC stocks and (ii) soil sample mass has to be corrected for bulk density changes in order to compare land-use types on the same basis of soil mass. Without soil mass correction, land-use change effects would have been underestimated by 28%. Land-use change impact on SOC was not restricted to the surface soil, but relative changes were equally high in the subsoil, stressing the importance of sufficiently deep sampling.",afforestation; bulk density; deforestation; land-use change; soil; organic carbon; subsoil; tropics
670,included,Climatic role of terrestrial ecosystem under elevated CO2: a bottom-up greenhouse gases budget,"The net balance of greenhouse gas (GHG) exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere under elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) remains poorly understood. Here, we synthesise 1655 measurements from 169 published studies to assess GHGs budget of terrestrial ecosystems under elevated CO2. We show that elevated CO2 significantly stimulates plant C pool (NPP) by 20%, soil CO2 fluxes by 24%, and methane (CH4) fluxes by 34% from rice paddies and by 12% from natural wetlands, while it slightly decreases CH4 uptake of upland soils by 3.8%. Elevated CO2 causes insignificant increases in soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes (4.6%), soil organic C (4.3%) and N (3.6%) pools. The elevated CO2-induced increase in GHG emissions may decline with CO2 enrichment levels. An elevated CO2-induced rise in soil CH4 and N2O emissions (2.76 Pg CO2-equivalent year(-1)) could negate soil C enrichment (2.42 Pg CO2 year(-1)) or reduce mitigation potential of terrestrial net ecosystem production by as much as 69% (NEP, 3.99 Pg CO2 year(-1)) under elevated CO2. Our analysis highlights that the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to act as a sink to slow climate warming under elevated CO2 might have been largely offset by its induced increases in soil GHGs source strength.",Climate change; elevated CO2; greenhouse gas; meta-analysis; plant C pool; soil C and N cycle

This study aims to investigate the responses of these C and N pools to short- term experimental warming in an alpine meadow of Tibet. A warming experiment using open top chambers was conducted in an alpine meadow at three elevations (i.e., a low (4313 m), mid- (4513 m), and high (4693 m) elevation) in May 2010. Topsoil (0-20 cm depth) samples were collected in July-September 2011. Experimental warming increased soil temperature by similar to 1-1.4 degrees C but decreased soil moisture by similar to 0.04 m(3) m(-3). Experimental warming had little effects on SOC, TN, DOC, and DON, which may be related to lower warming magnitude, the short period of warming treatment, and experimental warming-induced soil drying by decreasing soil microbial activity. Experimental warming decreased significantly inorganic N at the two lower elevations, but had negligible effect at the high elevation. Our findings suggested that the effects of short- term experimental warming on SOC, TN and dissolved organic matter were insignificant, only affecting inorganic forms.",

Meanwhile a lot of leadership behaviors have been identified that affect the health of employees. To measure them requires high costs. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify core-factors of salutogenic leadership and to operationalize them for an efficient diagnosis. As an integrative work-related indicator of employees' health sense of work coherence (Work-SoC) was chosen. In a deductive and inductive process the TIMP-inventory has been developed that enables the economic assessment of three leadership dimensions: Trust, Incident Management and Pressure. These factors explain with less items more variance of the Work-SoC construct than established general and health-related leadership scales of transformational leadership, consideration, social support, demanding leadership as well as positive and negative health behavior. That is why the TIMP-factors can be recognized as core-factors of health-promoting leadership.",Leadership; Health; Sense of coherence; Interaction processes; Salutogenesis

Whereas some argue that dexamethasone might aid antibiotic treatment, others believe that because of its immunosuppressive characteristics, it might have a negative impact on outcomes. How corticosteroid use affects overall mortality of brain abscess patients remains unclear. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were utilized to identify all studies related to patients diagnosed with a brain abscess treated with dexamethasone. The main outcome of interest was mortality. Pooled effect estimates were calculated using fixed-effects (FE) and random-effects (RE) models. RESULTS: After removal of duplicates, 1681 articles were extracted from the literature of which 11 were included. These included 7 cohort studies and 4 case series. Indications to administer dexamethasone were either hospital brain abscess protocol or clinical presentation of cerebral edema. The 7 cohort studies involving 571 patients with brain abscesses comprised of 330 patients treated with standard of care (SOC) plus dexamethasone and 241 patients treated with SOC alone, after aspiration or surgical management of the abscess in either group. Pooling results from all seven cohort studies demonstrated a nonsignificant mortality benefit comparing SOC and dexamethasone patients to SOC patients (FE: risk ratio [RR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-1.37; RE: RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 049-1.82; I-2 [53.9%; P for heterogeneity [0.04).

We assessed soil and microbial C in a 7-year manipulation of CO2 and warming in a semi-arid grassland. Continuous field isotopic labelling under elevated CO2 further allowed us to study the dynamics of the existing C (Old C) in soil and microbes as affected by warming. Warming reduced soil C under elevated CO2 but had no impact under ambient CO2. Loss of soil C under warming and elevated CO2 was attributed to increased proportional loss of Old C. Warming also reduced the proportion of Old C in microbes, specifically the bacteria, but not the fungi. These findings highlight that warming impacts are C pool and microbial taxa dependent and demonstrate interactive effects of warming and atmospheric CO2 on soil C.",Bacteria; carbon; climate change; elevated CO2; microbial C use; microbial communities; microbial function; soil; warming
675,excluded,Effects of elevated carbon dioxide on green leaf tissue and leaf litter quality in an intact mojave desert ecosystem,"The effects of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2 ) on plant litter are critical determinants of ecosystem feedback to changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We measured concentrations of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) and calculated C : N ratios of green leaves of two desert perennial shrubs, and the same quality parameters plus lignin and cellulose content of leaf litter from four shrub species exposed to elevated CO2 (FACE technology; <linkr rid=""b1"">Hendrey & Kimball, 1994) for 3 years in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem. Shrubs tested were Larrea tridentata , Lycium pallidum , Lycium andersonii and Ambrosia dumosa . We calculated resorption efficiency from green tissue and leaf litter N data and measured lignin and cellulose content in litter in the last year study. Green leaves of L. tridentata grown under elevated CO2 had significantly lower N concentrations and higher C : N ratios than shrubs grown in ambient conditions in 1999 (P < 0.05). Lycium pallidum green leaves grown under elevated CO2 had significantly lower N concentrations and higher C : N ratios than shrubs grown under ambient conditions in 2000 (P < 0.05). There was no CO2 effect on C content of either species. We found no effect of CO2 on N or C content, C : N ratios, or lignin or cellulose concentrations in leaf litter of L. tridentata , L. pallidum , L. andersonii , or A. dumosa . There was no significant effect of CO2 on estimates of shrub resorption efficiency. There was a seasonal effect on green tissue and litter tissue quality for L. tridentata , with lower tissue N content in summer than in spring or winter months. These data suggest that any productivity increases with elevated CO2 in desert ecosystems may not be limited by lower leaf litter quality and that resorption efficiency calculations are best performed on an individual leaf basis.",
676,excluded,Reassessing the role of grazing lands in carbon-balance estimations: meta-analysis and review,"Assuming a steady state between carbon (C) gains and losses, greenhouse gases (GHG) inventories that follow a widely used simplified procedure (IPCC Tier 1) tend to underestimate the capacity of soils in grazing-land to sequester C. In this study we compared the C balance reported by (i) national inventories that followed the simplified method (Tier 1) of IPCC (1996/2006), with (ii) an alternative estimation derived from the meta-analysis of science-based, peer-reviewed data. We used the global databases (i) EDGAR 4.2 to get data on GHG emissions due to land conversion and livestock/crop production, and (ii) HYDE 3.1 to obtain historical series on land-use/land cover (LULC). In terms of sequestration, our study was focused on C storage as soil organic carbon (SOC) in rural lands of four countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) within the so-called MERCOSUR region. Supported by a large body of scientific evidence, we hypothesized that C gains and losses in grazing lands are not in balance and that C gains tend to be higher than C losses at low livestock densities. We applied a two-way procedure to test our hypothesis: i) a theoretical one based on the annual conversion of belowground biomass into SOC; and ii) an empirical one supported by peer-reviewed data on SOC sequestration. Average figures from both methods were combined with LULC data to reassess the net C balance in the study countries. Our results show that grazing lands generate C surpluses that could not only offset rural emissions, but could also partially or totally offset the emissions of non-rural sectors. The potential of grazing lands to sequester and store soil C should be reconsidered in order to improve assessments in future GHG inventory reports. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

677,excluded,Cost effectiveness of secukinumab for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in the uk,"The aim was to determine the cost effectiveness of secukinumab, a fully human interleukin-17A inhibitor, for adults in the UK with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who are tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) na < ve and without concomitant moderate-to-severe psoriasis, and who have responded inadequately to conventional systemic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). The study took the perspective and setting of the UK National Health Service (NHS). The model structure was a 3-month decision tree leading into a Markov model. Separate analyses based on the number of prior csDMARDs (one and two or more) were conducted, with secukinumab 150 mg compared to standard of care (SoC) and TNFis, respectively, for each subpopulation. Clinical parameters, including response at 3 months, were from the FUTURE 2 trial and a network meta-analysis. Outcomes included total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the 40-year time horizon (3.5% annual discount for both outcomes; cost year 2017), and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The ICER for secukinumab 150 mg versus SoC was A 28,748 pound per QALY gained (one prior csDMARD). Secukinumab 150 mg dominated golimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept, and had an ICER of A 5680 pound per QALY gained versus adalimumab and > A 1 pound million saved per QALY foregone versus infliximab (two or more prior csDMARDs). Valuing one QALY at between A 20,000 pound and A 30,000 pound, the probability of secukinumab having the highest net monetary benefit was 48.9% (one prior csDMARD) and 88.9% (two or more prior csDMARDs). Parameters related to Health Assessment Questionnaire scores were most influential. Secukinumab 150 mg at list price appears to represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources for adults with PsA who have responded inadequately to one or two or more prior csDMARDs.",

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: From hospital admission until 3 months after discharge. PARTICIPANTS: Malnourished older adults (>= 60) newly admitted to an acute hospital (n = 210). INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to receive nutritional intervention (energy- and protein-enriched diet, oral nutritional supplements, calcium-vitamin D supplement, telephone counseling by a dietitian) for 3 months after discharge or usual care. MEASUREMENTS: Number of participants who fell, fall incidents, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and dietary intake. Measurements were performed on admission to hospital and 3 months after discharge. RESULTS: Three months after discharge, 10 participants (10%) in the intervention group had fallen at least once, compared with 24 (23%) in the control group (hazard ratio = 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.19-0.86). There were 57 fall incidents (16 in the intervention group; 41 in the control group). A significantly higher intake of energy (280 kcal, 95% CI = 37-524 kcal) and protein (11 g, 95% CI = 1-25 g) and significantly higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (10.9 nmol/L, 95% CI = 2.9-18.9 nmol/L) were found in participants in the intervention group than in controls.

679,excluded,Does afforestation of pastures increase sequestration of soil carbon in mediterranean climates?,"Afforestation of agricultural land to mitigate climate change and other environmental degradation has been increasingly implemented around the world. However, the effects of afforestation on soil carbon and particularly nitrogen content remain unclear. We conducted a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis of published data on the effects of afforestation of pastures on soil carbon and nitrogen stock's in a Mediterranean climate. We found no evidence for substantial changes in soil carbon, nitrogen or C:N ratio across three decades of afforestation. However, a lack of data on the carbon content of the litter underestimates the potential for afforestation to sequester carbon in the soil. We investigated soil carbon content under remnant woodlands and found that it was higher than under the afforested pastures suggesting that afforestation has the potential to increase soil carbon over longer time scales. Targeted studies that measure carbon content and form within soils over an extended chronosequence are much needed to improve predictions of the potential for afforestation to increase soil carbon storage.

680,excluded,Differential responses of soil microbial biomass and carbon-degrading enzyme activities to altered precipitation,"Altered precipitation regimes have a great impact on global climate change, with potentially important effects on below-ground carbon dynamics. Soil microbes and carbon (C)-degrading extracellular enzymes activities (EEAs) are considered as the rate-limiting step in C decomposition. However, the effect of altered precipitation on the microbial biomass, microbial EEAs, and mechanism for soil C dynamics has not been established. In current study, we synthesized the responses of microbial biomass, C -degrading EEAs, soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and soil respiration (SR) to altered precipitation from 70 published studies. The results showed that increased precipitation significantly enhanced soil microbial biomass and oxidative C -degrading EEAs (Ox-EEAs) by 16.18% and 6.58%, respectively, but had no effects on hydrolytic C -degrading EEAs (Hy-EEAs). Decreased precipitation led to a significant decline of soil microbial biomass and Ox-EEAs by 11.61% and 10.99%, respectively; however, Hy-EEAs increased by 25.79%. Furthermore, increased precipitation stimulated soil microbial biomass in shrub and grassland but had no effects in forest, while decreased precipitation repressed soil microbial biomass but increased Hy-EEAs in forest. The response ratios (RRs) of microbial biomass to altered precipitation were negatively correlated with the mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT); however, the RRs of Hy-EEAs were positively correlated with MAR Particularly, in low MAP (<= 600 mm), increased precipitation significantly increased soil microbial biomass by 21.40% but decreased precipitation did not affect soil microbial biomass; In contrast, in high MAP (>600 mm), decreased precipitation significantly declined soil microbial biomass by 1537%, and significantly increased Hy-EEAs by 2931% but increased precipitation did not affect both of them. Moreover, the RRs of microbial biomass and Ox-EEAs were significantly correlated with SOC, DOC, and SR; however, we only observed a negative relationship between RRs of Hy-EEAs and RRs of SOC, suggesting the concurrent responses of microbial biomass and C -degrading EEAs for below-ground C dynamics under simulated precipitation changes, and that a large amount of recalcitrant C in the soils would be highly susceptible to changing precipitation.

Design Prospective cohort study with 6-month follow-up. Setting Twenty-four primary care practices in the Netherlands. Participants Four hundred seventeen older adults (mean age 78.5, range 6595, 74% female) presenting consecutively to primary care with dizziness. Measurements Tests, including history and physical and additional examination, previously selected by an international expert panel and based on an earlier systematic review, were performed. The main outcome measure was 6-month dizziness-related impairment score measured using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory. Results Follow-up was complete for 92% of participants. Although 61% of participants experienced less impairment at 6 months, 130 participants (34%) showed persistent dizziness-related impairment. Factors most predictive of dizziness-related impairment at 6 months were onset of dizziness at least 6 months before inclusion, standing still as a dizziness-provoking circumstance, trouble with walking or (almost) falling (associated symptom), polypharmacy, absence of diabetes mellitus, presence of anxiety or depressive disorder, and impaired functional mobility. A score was constructed using these predictors to estimate the functional prognosis of dizziness at 6 months. Conclusion A score based on the presence of easily obtainable clinical information facilitates identification of older adults in primary care with poor functional prognosis of their dizziness without exactly knowing the cause(s) of their dizziness. Clinical management might be most effective by treating factors that can be influenced, such as polypharmacy, anxiety and depression, and functional mobility. J Am Geriatr Soc 60:2263-2269, 2012.",

DESIGN: The PSYCINFO, MEDLINE, and Abstracts in Social Gerontology databases were searched for English-language studies of cognitive interventions of exercise or extended cognitive practice between 1966 and 2010. The final search was in January 2011. Studies included were experimental interventions hypothesizing improvement on untrained cognitive outcomes with pre- and posttests. Studies of varying quality were included and compared. SETTING: Interventions generally took place in laboratories, in gymnasium facilities, in the home, and outdoors. Experimenters administered testing. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two studies with 3,781 healthy older adults aged 55 and older were analyzed. MEASUREMENTS: Between-group effect sizes (ESs), which account for practice effects on outcome measures, and within-experimental group ESs were computed from untrained cognitive outcome domains, including choice reaction time, memory, and executive function, and compared. ESs were also coded for training type and study quality. Multilevel mixed-effect analyses accommodated multiple outcomes from individual studies. RESULTS: Extended practice (estimated ES = 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.13-0.52) and aerobic fitness (estimated ES = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.10-0.55) training produced significant between-group ESs, but they did not differ in magnitude. Better study quality was associated with larger ESs. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that aerobic and extended cognitive practice training interventions for healthy older adults improve performance on untrained cognitive tasks.

683,included,"A meta-analysis on the response of microbial biomass, dissolved organic matter, respiration, and N mineralization in mineral soil to fire in forest ecosystems","The effects of fire on labile soil C and N in forest ecosystems are important for understanding C sequestration and N cycling not only because labile soil C and N are often variables that determine soil fertility but also because the role of soils as a source or sink for C is important on an ecosystem and on the regional level. In the current study, the literature on the effects of fire on soil organic C, total N, microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C, and total N, respiration, and N mineralization in mineral soil was reviewed, and the results of a meta-analysis on literature data were reported. Overall, fire significantly increased the soil total N, microbial biomass N. dissolved organic C, and total N, but decreased soil organic C, microbial biomass C, respiration and N mineralization. Among the significant effects of different fire types, wildfire had the higher effects on the soil organic C, total N, microbial biomass C and N, dissolved total N and respiration of soil than prescribed fire. In addition, responses of soil organic C. total N and N mineralization to wildfire depended on forest type and natural zone. Positive responses of soil organic C, total N were found in broadleaved forests and Mediterranean zones, and negative responses in coniferous forests and temperate zones. Wildfire significantly decreased N mineralization in coniferous forests. The effects of fire on soil microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C and N mineralization generally decreased with time after the fire. In general, the effects of fire on soil organic C, microbial biomass C, and dissolved total N and N mineralization decreased with increasing soil depth. These results suggest that fire increases C and N availability and increases microbial activity, which consequently decreases the potential rates of C sequestration. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the studies on the effects on soil-property dynamics after land-use changes are limited in semiarid regions. In this context, an experimental area with a semiarid climate allowed the assessment and comparison of physicochemical soil properties (soil organic C [SOC], soil total N [TN], available P [AP], available K [AK], cation-exchange capacity [CEC], bulk density [BD], pH, available water-holding capacity [AWHC], and C:N ratio) after Pinus halepensis afforestation and secondary succession following agriculture abandonment in 1994. The impact of 12 soil-preparation treatments for planting on soil properties was also evaluated. For this, soil samples (0-10 cm deep) from the afforestation were taken in 1998, 2002, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2016, and from abandoned cropland in 2010, 2013, and 2016. In afforestation, soil-preparation treatments did not alter differentially the soil properties after 22 years. Significant differences among years were found in SOC, TN, AP, AK, CEC, pH, and C:N. BD changes were detected neither in afforestation nor in abandoned cropland. After 22 years, only SOC, AK and the C:N ratio proved significantly higher in afforestation than in abandoned cropland. In general, soil properties improvement (i.e. SOC, TN, AP, AK, and CEC) was slow after afforestation and abandoned cropland likely due to the legacy of the previous land use (cereal crops) and the semiarid climate influence.

685,excluded,Life at the interface: above- and below-ground responses of a grazed pasture soil to reforestation,"Conversion of agricultural lands to mixed species woody plantings is increasingly being undertaken as a means of sequestering C and increasing biodiversity. The implications of such changes in land use for soil communities, and the ecosystem services they provide (e.g., nutrient and C cycling), are relatively little understood. Results of a detailed study of vegetation, soil physicochemical properties and soil communities (primarily microbial) to reforestation of a pasture (15 years post reforestation), and its immediately adjacent un-restored pasture, are presented. Whereas the reforested portion of the site had significantly higher levels of tree canopy cover and a well-developed litter layer than the immediately adjacent pasture, the reverse was true for grass biomass. Although there were no differences in total root biomass between the sampling zones, the pasture zone was dominated by fine roots and the reforested zone by coarse roots. Reforestation had a significant impact on soil physicochemical properties, with soil C, C: N and mineral N being higher than in the pasture. The reforestation also supported a greater microbial PLFA, a higher Fungal: Bacterial PLFA ratio and a different microbial community (based on PLFA profiles) from that of the adjacent pasture. There were also differences in earthworm abundance, with earthworms present and absent in soils from the pasture and reforested zones, respectively. All of the changes in vegetation, soil physicochemical properties and biotic communities occurred abruptly at the interface between the land-use types, with no evidence of an interaction between side of fence (reforested versus pasture zones) and distance from the fence. Results are discussed in the context of changes in land-use on soil ecology and their potential functional significance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

686,excluded,The tower of london (tol) in italy: standardization of the tol test in an italian population,"Deficit in planning and problem-solving, affecting a wide range of neuropsychological patients, has been widely investigated using the Tower of London (ToL) test, as developed by Shallice (Philos Trans R Soc Lond Ser B Biol Sci 298:199-209, 1). The ToL taps on several executive functions (EF), such as planning, time for planning or rule breaks, which may be usefully indexed by different ToL measurements. However, in its original version, the different aspects involved in ToL are not evaluated in a specific way. Here, we report the standardization of the ToL, on 896 individuals aged 15-86 years, taking in account individual factors (i.e. gender, age, years of education) which may affect performances on ToL. We computed several indexes on the ToL including score, planning and execution times, perseverations, rule breaks and self-monitoring. We found that these indexes were affected by individual factors such as gender, age and education. Present results not only provide extensive normative data according to gender, as well as different age and education ranges, but also represent a very useful instrument for a more fine-grained diagnosis of EF deficits in a wide range of neuropsychological patients, including traumatic brain injury and brain-damaged patients, as well as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease patients.",Tower of London; Executive deficit; Planning; Problem-solving; Frontal lobe; Normative data
687,excluded,"Effects of climate extremes on the terrestrial carbon cycle: concepts, processes and potential future impacts","Extreme droughts, heat waves, frosts, precipitation, wind storms and other climate extremes may impact the structure, composition and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, and thus carbon cycling and its feedbacks to the climate system. Yet, the interconnected avenues through which climate extremes drive ecological and physiological processes and alter the carbon balance are poorly understood. Here, we review the literature on carbon cycle relevant responses of ecosystems to extreme climatic events. Given that impacts of climate extremes are considered disturbances, we assume the respective general disturbance-induced mechanisms and processes to also operate in an extreme context. The paucity of well-defined studies currently renders a quantitative meta-analysis impossible, but permits us to develop a deductive framework for identifying the main mechanisms (and coupling thereof) through which climate extremes may act on the carbon cycle. We find that ecosystem responses can exceed the duration of the climate impacts via lagged effects on the carbon cycle. The expected regional impacts of future climate extremes will depend on changes in the probability and severity of their occurrence, on the compound effects and timing of different climate extremes, and on the vulnerability of each land-cover type modulated by management. Although processes and sensitivities differ among biomes, based on expert opinion, we expect forests to exhibit the largest net effect of extremes due to their large carbon pools and fluxes, potentially large indirect and lagged impacts, and long recovery time to regain previous stocks. At the global scale, we presume that droughts have the strongest and most widespread effects on terrestrial carbon cycling. Comparing impacts of climate extremes identified via remote sensing vs. ground-based observational case studies reveals that many regions in the (sub-)tropics are understudied. Hence, regional investigations are needed to allow a global upscaling of the impacts of climate extremes on global carbon-climate feedbacks.",carbon cycle; climate change; climate extremes; climate variability; disturbance; terrestrial ecosystems
688,excluded,Shrubs for the remediation of contaminated mediterranean areas: is the nurse effect mediated by increases in soil enzyme activities?,"The use of shrubs as nurse plants to facilitate woody plant recruitment has been proved to be particularly useful for the revegetation of highly disturbed environments, such as contaminated lands. In a contaminated area from SW Spain, we compared soil fertility and microbial enzyme activity in different microhabitats associated with shrubs, along a gradient of soil contamination, 13 years after the revegetation of the area following a contamination episode. We compared soil organic matter, nutrient content, and enzyme activities in four microhabitats: underneath retama (Retama sphaerocarpa) shrubs nursing Holm oak (Quercus ilex subsp. ballota) seedlings, underneath separate retama and oak individual plants, and in patches of soil without any woody cover. Soil enzyme activities were influenced more by the background soil conditions (pH and organic matter content, modified by the addition of a soil amendment during soil remediation) than by the development of the vegetation. In the soils under the cover of the retama-oak association, intense acidification (pH <4) was observed at the most contaminated sites, which resulted in higher solubility of toxic trace elements and lower enzyme activities (five times lower dehydrogenase and (beta-glucosidase activities, in comparison to neutral soils). The results suggest that improving soil conditions before plantation through amendment application is critical to ensure the improvement of microbial activity in the long-term at such degraded sites.

689,excluded,"Persistent effects of biochar on soil organic carbon mineralization and resistant carbon pool in upland red soil, china","Biochar as a soil ameliorant has generated great interest for scientists in improving soil quality and carbon sequestration. The objective of this study was to investigate the persistent effects of biochar application on soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization and soil-resistant carbon (C-r) in upland red soil. This experiment was conducted from September 2011 to May 2016. Biochar was applied only once in September 2011 at rates of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 t/ha in the field experiment, designated as treatments B-0, B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, B-5 and B-6. The chemical properties, dynamics of SOC mineralization and soil-resistant carbon (C-r) were measured at the 1st and 6th year after biochar application. The results were as follows: biochar application at rates of 30 and 40 t/ha (B5 and B6 treatments) distinctly increased soil pH value and available P relative to B-0 in 2011. The pH value, available P, SOC, total N and C/N ratio in B-4, B-5 and B-6 treatments were significantly higher compared with the B-0 treatment, where the B-6 treatment increased the pH value by 0.80 and C/N ratio by 3.88 while increasing available P, SOC and total N by 24.18, 76.29 and 19.78%, respectively, compared with the B-0 treatment in 2016. The cumulative SOC mineralization (C-m) occupied around 4.62-6.91% of total organic carbon (C-t), which showed a declining trend in 2016 as compared to 2011. The C-m/C-t ratio also showed a declining trend with biochar amendment at both samplings. The C-r occupied around 26-46% of SOC and showed obviously increasing trends both in 2011 and 2016. We further found that C-m/C-t showed highly significant (p < 0.01) negative correlations with the rates of biochar application both in 2011 and 2016. The Cr, however, showed very significant (p < 0.01) positive correlations with the rates of biochar application both in 2011 and 2016. This study suggested that biochar application to upland red soil persistently improved soil properties and resistant carbon. Cumulative SOC mineralization was clearly restrained by biochar amendment. This study can provide scientific support for improving soil fertility and enhancing carbon sequestration by application of large amount of biochar (40 t/ha) in upland red soil.",Biochar; Red soil; Soil organic carbon mineralization; Resistant carbon

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of active ambulatory care management supported by short message services and mobile phone technology with traditional ambulatory care management in AH patients. The study included 97 hypertensive patients under active ambulatory care management and 102 patients under traditional ambulatory care management. Blood pressure levels, body mass, and smoking history of patients were analyzed in the study. The duration of study was 1 year. In the active ambulatory care management group, 36% of patients were withdrawn from the study within a year. At the end of the year, 77% of patients from the active care management group had achieved the goal blood pressure level. That was more than 5 times higher than that in the traditional ambulatory care management group (P < .001). The risk ratio of achieving and maintaining the goal blood pressure in patients of active care management group was 5.44, CI (3.2-9.9; P = .005).

691,included,"Intensive forest harvesting increases susceptibility of northern forest soils to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus loss","Understanding the impact of forest harvesting is critical to sustainable forest management, yet there remains much uncertainty regarding how harvesting affects soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 808 observations from 49 studies to test the effects of harvesting on the stocks and concentrations of soil C, N and P and C:N:P ratios relative to uncut control stands. With all harvesting intensities combined, C stock was unaffected by harvesting in either the forest floor or mineral soil, while harvesting reduced forest floor [C], [N] and [P] and C:N ratio, increased the mineral soil [C] and C:N ratio, but reduced mineral soil N stock. The impacts of harvesting on forest floor C and N stocks, C:P and N:P and mineral soil [C] and [N] changed from no effects by partial, stem-only and whole-tree harvesting (WTH) to significantly negative effects by the harvesting coupled with fire. Stem-only and WTH similarly reduced forest floor [P]. The negative effects of harvesting were most pronounced in conifer stands. Soil [C], [N] and C:N decreased with time since harvesting, but soil [P] did not, resulting in an increase in forest floor N:P. Synthesis and applications. Our findings highlight the importance of harvest intensity and rotation length on long-term soil nutrient availability when managing forests. Furthermore, the lag in the recovery of phosphorus concentration following harvesting may indicate a decoupling of the phosphorus cycle from those of carbon and nitrogen, and a potential concern in managed forests.",carbon; clearcutting; compound disturbance; forest harvesting; harvest intensity; meta-analysis; nitrogen; phosphorus; rotation length; whole-tree harvesting
692,included,Warming enhances old organic carbon decomposition through altering functional microbial communities,"Soil organic matter (SOM) stocks contain nearly three times as much carbon (C) as the atmosphere and changes in soil C stocks may have a major impact on future atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and climate. Over the past two decades, much research has been devoted to examining the influence of warming on SOM decomposition in topsoil. Most SOM, however, is old and stored in subsoil. The fate of subsoil SOM under future warming remains highly uncertain. Here, by combining a long-term field warming experiment and a meta-analysis study, we showed that warming significantly increased SOM decomposition in subsoil. We also showed that a decade of warming promoted decomposition of subsoil SOM with turnover times of decades to millennia in a tall grass prairie and this effect was largely associated with shifts in the functional gene structure of microbial communities. By coupling stable isotope probing with metagenomics, we found that microbial communities in warmed soils possessed a higher relative abundance of key functional genes involved in the degradation of organic materials with varying recalcitrance than those in control soils. These findings suggest warming may considerably alter the stability of the vast pool of old SOM in subsoil, contributing to the long-term positive feedback between the C cycle and climate.",Bacteria/classification/genetics; Carbon/*chemistry; *Climate Change; *Hot Temperature; Metagenomics; Soil/*chemistry; *Soil Microbiology

Location Pantropical. Methods We conducted a synthesis of 81 studies reporting soil C stocks in more than 400 reforested and tree plantation sites. We used regression models and regression tree analyses to determine the importance of multiple predictor variables on soil C stocks standardized to three common depth ranges: 010, 030 and 0100?cm. Results Mean annual temperature (MAT) was the most important predictor of soil C. Forest age explained little to no variability in soil C, in contrast with above-ground studies. Data on long-term trends in soil C are limited, as median time since forest growth was 15 years. Soil C stocks were similar between tropical secondary forests, tree plantations and reference forests. Differences between plantation and successional forests only appeared below 10?cm on sites with MAT < 21.3?degrees C. Former pastures and cultivated sites differed from each other only to depths of 30 or 100?cm. Climatic variables appeared multiple times across all layers of the regression trees, consistent with strong interactions between MAT and precipitation on soil C stocks. Main conclusions Climate explained greater variability in soil C in successional and plantation forests than former land use or forest age, despite the tropical location of all sites. Human management factors were more important for predicting soil C stocks in cooler and drier sites, while environmental variables were more important in hotter and wetter sites. The relative importance and interactions between soil type, previous land use and forest cover type differed with soil depth, highlighting the importance of comparing C across consistent depths. Climatic controls suggest sensitivity of soil C stocks in successional and plantation forests to future climate change.",
694,excluded,The effects of self-control on cognitive resource allocation during sustained attention: a transcranial doppler investigation,"Vigilance, or sustained attention, is a required ability in many operational professions. While past research has consistently indicated that vigilance performance declines over time, referred to as the vigilance decrement, the theoretical mechanisms underlying the decrement continue to be explored. In the current study, trait self-control was examined to determine how this individual differences measure may contribute to the theoretical explanation of vigilance decrement. Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) was used as a measure of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), as previous research has indicated that CBFV may index attentional resource allocation during vigilance (e.g., Shaw et al. in Hum Factors Ergon Soc 50:1619-1623, 2009). Participants performed a demanding 12-min computer-based vigilance task. Prior to the task, a validated self-report measure was used to determine trait-level self-control, and subjective workload was measured after the task was completed. Participants were divided, based upon survey responses, as either low- or high-trait self-control. Performance results showed a significant decrement across participants, but no significant main effect or interaction relating to the self-control measure was observed. Results relating to the TCD measure showed a significant decline in CBFV in the low self-control group, but no CBFV decrement was observed in the high self-control group. The subjective workload results revealed a nonsignificant trend of the low self-control group becoming more frustrated after the task. These results suggest that there are differences in the resource allocation strategies between low and high self-control participants. How trait self-control can add to an understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of sustained attention performance is discussed.",Self-control; Vigilance; Cognitive resource theory; Transcranial Doppler sonography; Cerebral blood flow velocity

There are no systematic reviews analyzing the typical injury patterns and treatments in Mega-Mass-Casualty earthquakes. The characterization of an injury pattern specific to disaster type, be it natural or manmade, is imperative to build an effective disaster preparedness and response system. Methods The systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). A comprehensive search strategy was developed to identify all publications relating to earthquakes and the orthopedic treatment in adult patients. The following databases were searched: PubMed (Medline; US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, Maryland USA), Ovid (Ovid Technologies; New York, New York USA), Web of Science (Thomson Reuters; New York, New York USA), and The Cochrane Library (The Cochrane Collaboration; Oxford, United Kingdom). Results The searches identified 4,704 articles: 4,445 after duplicates were removed. The papers were screened for title and abstract and 65 out of those were selected for full-text analysis. The quality of data does not permit a standard-of-care (SOC) to be defined. Scarcity and poor quality of the data collected also may suggest a low level of accountability of the activity of the international hospital teams. Qualitatively, it is possible to define that there are more open fractures during daytime hours than at night. Excluding data about open and closed fractures, for all types of injuries, the results underline that the higher the impact of the earthquake, as measured by Richter Magnitude Scale (RMS), the higher is the number of injuries. Discussion Regarding orthopedic injuries during earthquakes, special attention must be paid to the management of the lower limbs most frequently injured. Spinal cord involvement following spine fractures is an important issue: this underlines how a neurosurgeon on a disaster team could be an important asset during the response. Conservative treatment for fractures, when possible, should be encouraged in a disaster setting. Regarding amputation, it is important to underline how the response and the quality of health care delivered is different from one team to another. This study shows how important it is to improve, and to require, the accountability of international disaster teams in terms of type and quality of health care delivered, and to standardize the data collection.",disaster; earthquake; injury; orthopedic; review
696,included,Effects of sod cultivation on soil nutrients in orchards across China: A meta-analysis,"Plantation of fruit trees is an important measure of agriculture and vegetation restoration as it produces economic output with obvious ecological effects, making orchards contribute greatly to increased vegetation coverage around the world. Sod cultivation in orchards is a popular management measure but whether it affects soil nutrient condition in different ways, e.g., among different climatic zones or under different soil types, remains unclear. This meta-analysis was conducted to clarify effects of sod cultivation in orchards on soil nutrients (including carbon [C], nitrogen [N], phosphorus [P] and potassium [K]) across China which covers different climatic zones and soil types. Results showed that sod cultivation significantly increased soil organic C (SOC), total and available N, available P and total K contents, but significantly reduced total P and available K contents in orchard soils. These changes of soil nutrients were not a result of cultivation-induced modifications in soil pH and bulk density but instead were probably led by changed nutrient demands and inputs of plants in associated with altered microbial processes. Moreover, climate, edaphic properties and the cultivated grass species apparently affected responses of soil nutrients to sod cultivation. Discrepancies in substrate supply and microbial properties induced by grass cultivations in different systems could have contributed to the observed patterns. Further studies, e.g., simultaneously investigating soil nutrient condition, plant productivity and soil microbial properties, remain needed to improve our understanding of the potential mechanisms by which sod cultivation could change soil nutrient conditions.

697,included,One-hundred years after shrub encroachment: Policy directions towards sustainable rangeland-use,"In many shrub-encroached lands, livestock grazing is the dominant land-use type which shapes stakeholders' perspective on single ecosystem service provision (i.e., forage production). Although recent ecological studies suggested otherwise, recognition of multiple ecosystem services from shrublands is rarely translated into policy, likely due to the lack of robust scientific evidence on trade-offs between ecosystem services following shrub removal. Based on meta-analysis from global publications, we found that while shrub removal increased forage provision, such effect was generally short-lived (""5 years). At the same time, shrub removal also increased bare soil, decreased soil nutrients and soil organic carbon, which potentially reduced erosion control and nutrient cycling service. These trade-offs tended to be more prominent with increasing disturbance intensity (i.e., higher shrub removal frequencies or switching from single to multiple shrub removal methods). To encourage adaptation to the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services from shrublands, we provided a framework on how to value such landscapes, including the estimated monetary values that could be generated from maintaining them. Since there will be a time-lag until most monetary values appear, initial incentives may be necessary to encourage the adoption of conservation practices, in addition to efforts to increase society awareness (e.g., eco-labelling, alternative food networks or social media) on multiple ecological benefits from shrublands and investment to provide capacity building for pastoralists.",Arid; Climate change; Ecohydrology; Ecosystem service; Grassland; Grazing; Livestock
698,excluded,Changes in litter quality caused by simulated nitrogen deposition reinforce the n-induced suppression of litter decay,"Rates of nitrogen (N) deposition are increasing in industrialized and rapidly developing nations. Simulated N deposition suppresses plant litter decay rates, in particular for low quality (high lignin) litter. Litter quality is a primary driver of litter decomposition; however, it is not clear how changes in litter quality caused by long-term ecosystem exposure to chronic N additions interact with altered soil N-availability to influence litter decay dynamics. To document the effects of simulated N deposition on litter quality, we conducted a meta-analysis of available litter nutrient data from simulated N deposition experiments in temperate forests. To directly test whether changes in litter quality caused by N deposition affect decay rates, we also conducted a reciprocal litterbag study in an existing N addition experiment, where a northern hardwood forest has been exposed to simulated N deposition for more than 20 years. The experiment enabled us to disentangle the effects of N additions, litter quality, and their interactions on litter decay dynamics. We measured litter mass loss and extracellular enzyme activities after one and two years of decomposition. The meta-analysis demonstrated that simulated N deposition causes decreases of leaf Al, B, Ca, Mg, Mn, P, and Zn concentrations, and increased leaf N concentrations. Moreover, higher cumulative amounts of simulated N deposition result in greater decreases of leaf Ca and Mn concentrations. In the field experiment, litter originally collected from N-enriched plots exhibited similar N-induced nutrient changes as observed in our meta-analysis and also had lower lignolytic enzyme activities and decay rates than litter collected from control plots. The decreased litter decay rates observed with simulated N deposition were a result of the combined effects of the N fertilization itself and the historical effects of N deposition on tree litter chemistry. The data suggest that changes in litter quality caused directly by long-term N enrichment reinforce the negative effects of simulated N deposition on litter decay, particularly for high lignin species. The slowed decay associated with changes in litter quality caused by N enrichment itself may partly explain the accumulation of organic matter previously observed at ours and at other simulated N deposition experiments.",calcium; decomposition; extracellular enzymes; lignin; litter decay; litter quality; manganese; meta-analysis; nitrogen; Quercus; temperate forest

Methods: Patients with heart failure (HF) and coronary artery disease (CAD) were included. Online databases were searched for prospective studies of patients with HF and CAD who had comprehensive echocardiography. Mortality in patients with pseudonormal filling was compared with restrictive filling and other nonrestrictive filling patterns, including normal and abnormal relaxation. Review Manager Version 4.2.7 software was used for the analysis. Results: Seven studies (5 HF and 2 CAD) were identified, and 887 patients (244 deaths) were included. The pseudonormal filling pattern conferred a 4-fold increase in odds of death compared with abnormal relaxation/normal (odds ratio 4.46; 95% confidence interval, 2.87-6.92). Outcome was similar when restrictive filling was compared with pseudonormal filling (odds ratio 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.74). Death was the main outcome measure. Conclusion: This literature-based meta-analysis, pooling results from 7 prospective studies, demonstrates the 4-fold increase in odds of death associated with pseudonormal filling compared with abnormal relaxation/normal. The pseudonormal filling pattern and restrictive filling pattern are associated with similar risk of death. These data further support the need for a comprehensive assessment of diastolic filling, including assessment for pseudonormal filling, as part of routine echocardiographic risk stratification in patients with HF and CAD.

700,included,A meta-analysis on the impacts of partial cutting on forest structure and carbon storage,"Partial cutting, which removes some individual trees from a forest, is one of the major and widespread forest management practices that can significantly alter both forest structure and carbon (C) storage. Using 748 observations from 81 studies published between 1973 and 2011, we synthesized the impacts of partial cutting on three variables associated with forest structure (mean annual growth of diameter at breast height (DBH), stand basal area, and volume) and four variables related to various C stock components (aboveground biomass C (AGBC), understory C, forest floor C, and mineral soil C). Results show that the growth of DBH increased by 111.9% after partial cutting, compared to the uncut control, with a 95% bootstrapped confidence interval ranging from 92.2 to 135.9%, while stand basal area and volume decreased immediately by 34.2% ([-37.4%, -31.2%]) and 28.4% ([-32.0%, -25.1%]), respectively. On average, partial cutting reduced AGBC by 43.4% ([-47.7%, -39.3%]), increased understory C storage by 391.5% ([220.0%, 603.8%]), but did not show significant effects on C stocks on forest floor and in mineral soil. All the effects, if significant (i.e., on DBH growth, stand basal area, volume, and AGBC), intensified linearly with cutting intensity and decreased linearly over time. Overall, cutting intensity had more strong impacts than the length of recovery time on the responses of those variables to partial cutting. Besides the significant influence of cutting intensity and recovery time, other factors such as climate zone and forest type also affected forest responses to partial cutting. For example, a large fraction of the changes in DBH growth re-mains unexplained, suggesting the factors not included in the analysis may play a major role. The data assembled in this synthesis were not sufficient to determine how long it would take for a complete recovery after cutting because long-term experiments were scarce. Future efforts should be tailored to increase the duration of the experiments and balance geographic locations of field studies.",basal area; carbon sequestration; forest ecosystem; forest floor; geographical region; growth rate; meta-analysis; volume
701,excluded,The effect of fire on microbial biomass: a meta-analysis of field studies,"Soil microbes regulate the transfer of carbon (C) from ecosystems to the atmosphere and in doing so influence feedbacks between terrestrial ecosystems and global climate change. Fire is one element of global change that may influence soil microbial communities and, in turn, their contribution to the C dynamics of ecosystems. In order to improve our understanding of how fire influences belowground communities, we conducted a meta-analysis of 42 published microbial responses to fire. We hypothesized that microbial biomass as a whole, and fungal biomass specifically, would be altered following fires. Across all studies, fire reduced microbial abundance by an average of 33.2% and fungal abundance by an average of 47.6%. However, microbial responses to fire differed significantly among biomes and fire types. For example, microbial biomass declined following fires in boreal and temperate forests but not following grasslands fires. In addition, wildfires lead to a greater reduction in microbial biomass than prescribed burns. These differences are likely attributable to differences in fire severity among biomes and fire types. Changes in microbial abundance were significantly correlated with changes in soil CO2 emissions. Altogether, these results suggest that fires may significantly decrease microbial abundance, with corresponding consequences for soil CO2 emissions.",

However, the mitigation effectiveness of NT depends not only on its carbon sequestration potential but also on soil-derived CH4 and N2O emissions. A meta-analysis was conducted, using a dataset involving 136 comparisons from 39 studies in China, to identify site-specific factors which influence CH4 emission, CH4 uptake, and N2O emission under NT. Comparative treatments involved NT without residue retention (NT0), NT with residue retention (NTR), compared to plow tillage (PT) with residue removed (PT0). Overall, NT0 significantly decreased CH4 emission by similar to 30% (P<0.05) compared to PT0 with an average emission 218.8kgha(-1) for rice paddies. However, the increase in N2O emission could partly offset the benefits of the decrease in CH4 emission under NT compared to PT0. NTR significantly enhanced N2O emission by 82.1%, 25.5%, and 20.8% (P<0.05) compared to PT0 for rice paddies, acid soils, and the first 5years of the experiments, respectively. The results from categorical meta-analysis indicated that the higher N2O emission could be mitigated by adopting NT within alkaline soils, for long-term duration, and with less N fertilization input when compared to PT0. In addition, the natural log (lnR) of response ratio of CH4 and N2O emissions under NT correlated positively (enhancing emission) with climate factors (temperature and precipitation) and negatively (reducing emission) with experimental duration, suggesting that avoiding excess soil wetness and using NT for a long term could enhance the benefits of NT. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the conditions favoring greenhouse gas(es) reductions is essential to achieving climate change mitigation and advancing food security in China.",climate change mitigation; meta-analysis; methane; nitrous oxide; no-till; residue retention

Test-retest correlation show stability and range from 0.69 to 0.78 ( 1 year), 0.64 ( 3 years), 0.42 to 0.45 ( 4 years), 0.59 to 0.67 ( 5 years) to 0.54 ( 10 years). The means of SOC-29 range 100.50 ( SD 28.50) to 164.50 ( SD 17.10) points and SOC-13 from 35.39 ( SD 0.10) to 77.60 ( SD 13.80) points. After 10 years SOC seems to be comparatively stable, but not as stable as Antonovsky initially assumed. SOC tends to increase with age. The factorial structure of SOC seems rather to be multidimensional than unidimensional. SOC predicts a positive outcome in a long term perspective, although there are divergent findings reported. The SOC scale seems to be a reliable, valid, and cross culturally applicable instrument measuring how people manage stressful situations and stay well.",
704,included,Ecosystem Carbon Stock Influenced by Plantation Practice: Implications for Planting Forests as a Measure of Climate Change Mitigation,"Uncertainties remain in the potential of forest plantations to sequestrate carbon (C). We synthesized 86 experimental studies with paired-site design, using a meta-analysis approach, to quantify the differences in ecosystem C pools between plantations and their corresponding adjacent primary and secondary forests (natural forests). Totaled ecosystem C stock in plant and soil pools was 284 Mg C ha(-1) in natural forests and decreased by 28% in plantations. In comparison with natural forests, plantations decreased aboveground net primary production, litterfall, and rate of soil respiration by 11, 34, and 32%, respectively. Fine root biomass, soil C concentration, and soil microbial C concentration decreased respectively by 66, 32, and 29% in plantations relative to natural forests. Soil available N, P and K concentrations were lower by 22, 20 and 26%, respectively, in plantations than in natural forests. The general pattern of decreased ecosystem C pools did not change between two different groups in relation to various factors: stand age (<25 years vs. <= 25 years), stand types (broadleaved vs. coniferous and deciduous vs. evergreen), tree species origin (native vs. exotic) of plantations, land-use history (afforestation vs. reforestation) and site preparation for plantations (unburnt vs. burnt), and study regions (tropic vs. temperate). The pattern also held true across geographic regions. Our findings argued against the replacement of natural forests by the plantations as a measure of climate change mitigation.",*Agriculture; Biomass; Carbon/*analysis; *Climate Change; *Conservation of Natural Resources; *Ecosystem; Geography; Publications; Soil; Trees/*growth & development
705,excluded,Trees on farms to support natural capital: an evidence-based review for grazed dairy systems,"Intensification of the dairy industry globally, combined with a changing climate, has placed increased pressure on natural capital assets (and the flow of ecosystem services) on farms. Agroforestry is widely promoted as an intervention to address these issues. While some benefits of integrating trees on farms, such as carbon sequestration and biodiversity, are reasonably well known, less is known about other potential benefits, such as on-farm production. Understanding and quantifying these benefits would inform farm planning and decision-making. We used a systematic review approach to analyse the evidence base for biophysical ecosystem services from woody systems (including shelterbelts, riparian plantings, plantations, pasture trees, silvopasture and remnant native vegetation) provided to grazed dairy enterprises. We identified 83 publications containing 123 records that fit our review criteria of reporting on biophysical ecosystem services from woody systems on dairy farms relative to a grazed pasture comparison. For each relationship between a woody system and ecosystem service, we assessed the level of support, strength and predominant direction of evidence, and summarised the causal relationships (woody system >> mechanism >> outcome). Shelterbelts and riparian plantings were the most commonly reported woody systems. Linkages between woody systems and ecosystem services were largely positive, with the types of services provided and their importance differing among systems. Mean evaluation scores for the strength of the evidence were moderate to strong. However, the number of records for each relationship was often low. Consequently, only eight of the 30 causal pathways identified had high confidence; a further 14 had medium confidence indicating that these have good potential to deliver benefits but warrant further work. Although the evidence here was largely qualitative, our results provide strong support for the internal benefits that natural capital assets, such as on-farm woody systems, can provide to the productivity and resilience of grazed dairy enterprises.

706,excluded,"Interplay of soil water repellency, soil aggregation and organic carbon. A meta-analysis","Soil water repellency (SWR) is a widely observed phenomenon where water infiltration is delayed on the soil surface for a time before soaking in. High SWR not only causes problems in agriculture for prolonged irrigation and waste of water, but also might benefit soil by enhancing aggregate stability in post-fire, arid and seasonally dry ecosystems. For a better understanding of the mechanisms behind SWR, we performed a random-effects meta-analysis of 119 experiments from 27 publications, measuring aggregate stability (AS), the content of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil water repellency. We explored how SWR was moderated by AS, SOC, soil pH, soil sand content, treatments (fire, microbe and organic matter), experimental setting (laboratory or field), plant type, sampling depth, sample drying methods, and SWR measurement (contact angle, water drop penetration time, repellency index and molarity of ethanol droplet). We found that SWR, AS and SOC were correlated positively; soil pH (4-8), soil sand content and experimental duration affected SWR significantly. We also found that in burned soil the interaction between SWR and AS was different from other treatments, suggesting the presence of a different underlying mechanism. Two data issues were identified: (1) the effects of soil microbes and soil fauna were generally less well studied; and (2) the measuring conditions of SWR, especially soil water content, were not reported which caused problems in study comparisons. Our results emphasize the importance of integrating SWR and AS in soil research as interacting soil processes that influence soil stability and functions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

707,included,Effect of land-use and land-cover change on mangrove blue carbon: A systematic review,"Mangroves shift from carbon sinks to sources when affected by anthropogenic land-use and land-cover change (LULCC). Yet, the magnitude and temporal scale of these impacts are largely unknown. We undertook a systematic review to examine the influence of LULCC on mangrove carbon stocks and soil greenhouse gas (GHG) effluxes. A search of 478 data points from the peer-reviewed literature revealed a substantial reduction of biomass (82% +/- 35%) and soil (54% +/- 13%) carbon stocks due to LULCC. The relative loss depended on LULCC type, time since LULCC and geographical and climatic conditions of sites. We also observed that the loss of soil carbon stocks was linked to the decreased soil carbon content and increased soil bulk density over the first 100 cm depth. We found no significant effect of LULCC on soil GHG effluxes. Regeneration efforts (i.e. restoration, rehabilitation and afforestation) led to biomass recovery after similar to 40 years. However, we found no clear patterns of mangrove soil carbon stock re-establishment following biomass recovery. Our findings suggest that regeneration may help restore carbon stocks back to pre-disturbed levels over decadal to century time scales only, with a faster rate for biomass recovery than for soil carbon stocks. Therefore, improved mangrove ecosystem management by preventing further LULCC and promoting rehabilitation is fundamental for effective climate change mitigation policy.",carbon emissions; carbon stocks; climate change mitigation; coastal wetlands; meta-analysis; Paris Agreement; restoration

DESIGN: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (no language restriction, through July 2009), and manual search. SETTING: Community and nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS: Participants in fifty-four placebo-controlled randomized trials and extension studies of ChEIs and memantine that reported falls, syncope, and related events in cognitively impaired older adults. MEASUREMENTS: Falls, syncope, fracture, and accidental injury. RESULTS: ChEI use was associated with greater risk of syncope (odds ratio (OR) = 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-2.30) than placebo but not with other events (falls: OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.74-1.04; fracture: OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 0.75-2.56; accidental injury: OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.87-1.45). Memantine use was associated with fewer fractures (OR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.05-0.85) but not with other events (falls: OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.72-1.18; syncope: OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.35-3.04; accidental injury: OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.56-1.12). There was no differential effect according to type and severity of cognitive impairment, residential status, or length of follow-up, although because of underreporting and small number of events, a potential benefit or risk cannot be excluded. CONCLUSION: ChEIs may increase the risk of syncope, with no effects on falls, fracture, or accidental injury in cognitively impaired older adults. Memantine may have a favorable effect on fracture, with no effects on other events. More research is needed to confirm the reduction in fractures observed formemantine.

709,excluded,Effects of Long-Term Fertilization Management Practices on Soil Microbial Biomass in China's Cropland: A Meta-Analysis,"Soil microbial biomass (SMB) plays an important role in enhancing soil aggregation, promoting nutrient cycling, and making a substantial contribution to soil organic matter. Little is known about the underlying mechanism and broad-scale responses of SMB to long-term fertilization practices on a regional scale. The objective of this study is to characterize changes in SMB of predominant cropping systems in China (mainly producing maize [Zea mays L.], wheat [Triticum aestivum L.], rice [Oryza sativa L.], and soybean [Glycine max L.]) under different fertilization regimes using meta-analysis. We integrated data from more than 60 studies conducted in China from 1990 to 2015 and found that application of inorganic fertilizer, straw, straw with inorganic fertilizer, manure, and manure with inorganic fertilizer increased soil microbial biomass carbon (C-mic) concentration, while nitrogen-only (N) and nitrogen plus manure (NM) decreased soil microbial biomass nitrogen (N-mic) concentration compared with control (no fertilizer application). Our results indicated greater C-mic and N-mic responses to inorganic N, P, and K-based fertilizers plus manure (NPKM) in the mid-lati-tude region compared with those in the low- and high-latitude regions of China. The differences in means (C-mic or N-mic con-centration) among different fertilization treatments decreased with experimental duration, and N-mic concentration decreased with increase in N rate. Our results suggested that long-term (similar to 10 yr) continuous annual fertilization of N provided the greatest SMB, and the optimal rate was about 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The application of NPKM demonstrated the greatest potential for increasing SMB of major cropping systems in China.",
710,included,Responses of ecosystem carbon cycle to experimental warming: a meta-analysis,"Global warming potentially alters the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle, likely feeding back to further climate warming. However, how the ecosystem C cycle responds and feeds back to warming remains unclear. Here we used a meta-analysis approach to quantify the response ratios of 18 variables of the ecosystem C cycle to experimental warming and evaluated ecosystem C-cycle feedback to climate warming. Our results showed that warming stimulated gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) by 15.7%, net primary production (NPP) by 4.4%, and plant C pools from above- and belowground parts by 6.8% and 7.0%, respectively. Experimental warming accelerated litter mass loss by 6.8%, soil respiration by 9.0%, and dissolved organic C leaching by 12.1%. In addition, the responses of some of those variables to experimental warming differed among the ecosystem types. Our results demonstrated that the stimulation of plant-derived C influx basically offset the increase in warming-induced efflux and resulted in insignificant changes in litter and soil C content, indicating that climate warming may not trigger strong positive C-climate feedback from terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, the increase in plant C storage together with the slight but not statistically significant decrease of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) across ecosystems suggests that terrestrial ecosystems might be a weak C sink rather than a C source under global climate warming. Our results are also potentially useful for parameterizing and benchmarking land surface models in terms of C cycle responses to climate warming.",C-climate feedback; C efflux; C influx; C pools; global warming; terrestrial ecosystems
711,excluded,A Global Meta-Analysis on the Impact of Management Practices on Net Global Warming Potential and Greenhouse Gas Intensity from Cropland Soils,"Management practices, such as tillage, crop rotation, and N fertilization, may affect net global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), but their global impact on cropland soils under different soil and climatic conditions need further evaluation. Available global data from 57 experiments and 225 treatments were evaluated for individual and combined effects of tillage, cropping systems, and N fertilization rates on GWP and GHGI which accounted for CO2 equivalents from N2O and CH4 emissions with or without equivalents from soil C sequestration rate (Delta SOC), farm operations, and N fertilization. The GWP and GHGI were 66 to 71% lower with no-till than conventional till and 168 to 215% lower with perennial than annual cropping systems, but 41 to 46% greater with crop rotation than monocroppping. With no-till vs. conventional till, GWP and GHGI were 2.6- to 7.4-fold lower when partial than full accounting of all sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs) were considered. With 100 kg N ha(-1), GWP and GHGI were 3.2 to 11.4 times greater with partial than full accounting. Both GWP and GHGI increased curvilinearly with increased N fertilization rate. Net GWP and GHGI were 70 to 87% lower in the improved combined management that included no-till, crop rotation/perennial crop, and reduced N rate than the traditional combined management that included conventional till, monocopping/annual crop, and recommended N rate. An alternative soil respiration method, which replaces Delta SOC by soil respiration and crop residue returned to soil in the previous year, similarly reduced GWP and GHGI by 133 to 158% in the improved vs. the traditional combined management. Changes in GWP and GHGI due to improved vs. traditional management varied with the duration of the experiment and inclusion of soil and climatic factors in multiple linear regressions improved their relationships. Improved management practices reduced GWP and GHGI compared with traditional management practices and combined management practices were even more effective than individual management practices in reducing net GHG emissions from cropland soils. Partial accounting overestimated GWP and GHGI values as sinks or sources of net GHGs compared with full accounting when evaluating the effect of management practices.",

Indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs), namely network meta-analysis (NMA), anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), and simulated treatment comparison (STC), were conducted to compare the relative efficacy of these therapies.MethodsPatient-level data from a study that evaluated InO with standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy (INO-VATE-ALL) and published data from a study that evaluated Blina with SoC chemotherapy (TOWER) were used in the analyses. Endpoints evaluated included remission rate defined as complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery(CR/CRi), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), overall survival(OS), and event-free survival(EFS). For each outcome, treatment-effect modifiers were adjusted for in the anchored MAIC and STC analyses.ResultsAnalyses showed statistically significant higher rates of remission and HSCT with InO compared to Blina irrespective of the ITC method used or measure of the effect (i.e., odds ratio[OR] or rate difference). The treatment effects derived from the MAIC and STC analyses were consistent and stronger than those estimated from the NMA. A trend favoring InO was detected for EFS. The ITC results for OS suggest no difference between InO and Blina.ConclusionResults from these ITCs indicated a statistically significant advantage for InO over Blina for rates of remission and HSCT in adults with relapsed or refractory Bcell precursor ALL. It was not possible to fully adjust for all treatment-effect modifiers, and the similarity in chemotherapy regimens used in the SoC comparator arms of the INO-VATE-ALL and TOWER studies is worthy of further exploration.

The benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation (ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol) were assessed in patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD, dialysis-dependent CKD, and renal transplant recipients. Design, setting, participants, & measurements MEDLINE (1966 to September 2009), SCOPUS (September 2009), and nephrology conference proceedings were searched for relevant observational and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Treatment effects were summarized as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random effects model. Separate analyses were conducted for observational studies and RCTs. Results Twenty-two studies (17 observational and 5 RCTs) were included. There was a significant improvement in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (MD 24.1 ng/ml, 95% CI 19.6 to 28.6) and an associated decline in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (MD -41.7 pg/ml, 95% CI -55.8 to -27.7) among observational studies. PTH reduction was higher in dialysis patients. Among RCTs, there was a significant improvement in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (MD 14 ng/ml, 95% CI 5.6 to 22.4) and an associated decline in PTH levels (MD -31.5 pg/ml, 95% CI -57 to -6.1). A low incidence of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia was reported with vitamin D supplementation. Cardiovascular and skeletal effects of vitamin D supplementation have not been studied. Included studies were mostly of low to moderate quality. Conclusions Available evidence from low-to-moderate quality observational studies and fewer RCTs suggests that vitamin D supplementation improves biochemical endpoints. However, whether such improvements translate into clinically significant outcomes is yet to be determined. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 6: 50-62, 2011. doi: 10.2215/CJN.03940510",
714,excluded,Influences of nitrogen fertilization and climate regime on the above-ground biomass yields of miscanthus and switchgrass: A meta-analysis,"Perennial grasses are touted as sustainable feedstocks for energy production. Such benefits, however, may be offset if excessive nitrogen (N) fertilization leads to economic and environmental issues. Furthermore, as yields respond to changes in climate, nutrient requirements will change, and thus guidance on minimal N inputs is necessary to ensure sustainable bioenergy production. Here, a pairwise meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of N fertilization (amount and duration) and climate on the above-ground biomass yields of miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). Both regression models and meta-analyses showed that switchgrass was more responsive to N than miscanthus, although both showed significant and positive N effects. Meta-analysis further showed that the positive growth response of miscanthus to N application increased with N addition rates of 60-300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), but the magnitude of the response decreased with the number of years of fertilization (duration). N effects on switchgrass biomass increased and peaked at rates of 120-160 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and 5-6 years of N inputs, but diminished for rates > 300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and > 7 years. Meta-analysis further revealed that the influences of N on switchgrass increased with both mean annual temperature and precipitation. Miscanthus yields were less responsive to climate than switchgrass yields. This meta-analysis helps fill a gap in estimation of biofeedstock yields based on N fertilization and could help better estimate minimum N requirements and soil management strategies for miscanthus and switchgrass cultivation across climatic conditions, thereby improving the efficiency and sustainability of bioenergy cropping systems.",Bioenergy crops; Minimum nitrogen requirement; Mean annual temperature; Mean annual precipitation; Pairwise meta-analyses; Regression-based models

Data from a total of 2218 on-farm rice experiments were collected between 2000 and 2013 from the main rice production areas of China. Common treatments in each study included the optimum nutrient management (OPT), farmers' fertilizer practices (FP) and nutrient omission treatments which were used to assess YG, yield response to nutrient (YR), and NUE. This study used meta-analysis and ANOVA to evaluate differences across the four rice planting seasons (early, middle, late, and single-season rice). The average YA from the OPT was 8.5 t ha(-1), and the yield gap between OPT and FP was 0.6 t ha(-1). The YR to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) averaged 2.4, 0.9, and 1.0 t ha(-1) across all sites, respectively. Results using the Pearson' correlation analysis showed significantly negative coefficients for YR to soil nutrient contents and soil organic matter. The large variations in YR were attributed to differences in climatic conditions and soil indigenous nutrient supplies. As compared to FP, the average recovery efficiency (RE) to N, P, and K with OPT increased by 10.1, 5.0 and 8.6 percent across all sites, respectively. In order to narrow the YG and increase NUE, effective soil, plant, nutrient management measures, advances in knowledge and technologies would be required to sustain higher crop production.

716,excluded,Carbon and Nitrogen Accumulation in Post-Agricultural Forest Soils of Western New England,"The agricultural history of New England is reflected in the species composition, biomass, and productivity of the second-growth forests of the region. There are also effects of agricultural use on soil morphology, soil organic C (SOC) and N content, erosion status, and C stability, which can be specific to site-level characteristics or prior agricultural use. We conducted a survey of SOC amounts in chronosequences comprising 25 post-agricultural second-growth forests. Time since abandonment was estimated from tree ages, and the chronosequences were bounded by sites currently in agricultural use (n = 6) and minimally disturbed old forest (n = 4). At sites currently used for pasture, hay, or row crops, the median amount of SOC (to a depth of 55 cm) was 6.5 kg C m(-2) compared with 10.3 kg C m(-2) in the soils of the oldest forest stands. The chronosequences indicated that nearly all of the SOC accumulation occurred in the first century of afforestation. There were significant trends of SOC accumulation in the forest floor, upper mineral horizons (0-10 or 10-20 cm), and B horizons (20-55 cm) of soils that had been used for pasture, hay, or row crops but not for former woodlots. Multivariate analysis showed that years since agricultural abandonment and growing season degree days were the most important variables related to SOC content (68% sum of squares explained). There was a significant trend of N accumulation (1.3 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) in soils (to a depth of 55 cm) formerly used for cultivated crops but not for other former uses. Farms in this region were an important C sink during the last 150 yr; however, the capacity of former agricultural soils to gain SOC in the future is probably limited.",
717,excluded,Efficiency of weighted averages,"When combining estimates of a common parameter (of dimension d >= 1) from independent data sets-as in stratified analyses and meta analyses-a weighted average, with weights 'proportional' to inverse variance matrices, is shown to have a minimal variance matrix (a standard fact when d = 1)-minimal in the sense that all convex combinations of the coordinates of the combined estimate have minimal variances. Minimum variance for the estimation of a single coordinate of the parameter can therefore be achieved by joint estimation of all coordinates using matrix weights. Moreover, if each estimate is asymptotically efficient within its own data set, then this optimally weighted average, with consistently estimated weights, is shown to be asymptotically efficient in the combined data set and avoids the need to merge the data sets and estimate the parameter in question afresh. This is so whatever additional non-common nuisance parameters may be in the models for the various data sets. A special case of this appeared in Fisher [1925. Theory of statistical estimation. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 22, 700-725.]: Optimal weights are 'proportional' to information matrices, and he argued that sample information should be used as weights rather than expected information, to maintain second-order efficiency of maximum likelihood. A number of special cases have appeared in the literature; we review several of them and give additional special cases, including stratified regression analysis-proportional -hazards, logistic or linear-, combination of independent ROC curves, and meta analysis. A test for homogeneity of the parameter across the data sets is also given. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
718,excluded,Carbon pools recover more quickly than plant biodiversity in tropical secondary forests,"Although increasing efforts are being made to restore tropical forests, little information is available regarding the time scales required for carbon and plant biodiversity to recover to the values associated with undisturbed forests. To address this knowledge gap, we carried out a meta-analysis comparing data from more than 600 secondary tropical forest sites with nearby undisturbed reference forests. Above-ground biomass approached equivalence to reference values within 80 years since last disturbance, whereas below-ground biomass took longer to recover. Soil carbon content showed little relationship with time since disturbance. Tree species richness recovered after about 50 years. By contrast, epiphyte richness did not reach equivalence to undisturbed forests. The proportion of undisturbed forest trees and epiphyte species found in secondary forests was low and changed little over time. Our results indicate that carbon pools and biodiversity show different recovery rates under passive, secondary succession and that colonization by undisturbed forest plant species is slow. Initiatives such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and REDD+ should therefore encourage active management to help to achieve their aims of restoring both carbon and biodiversity in tropical forests.",

We assembled from the literature information on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil respiration (Rs) covering the forest successional chronosequence from pioneer masson pine (Pinus massoniana) forest (MPF) to medium broadleaf and needleleaf mixed forest (BNMF) and the climax evergreen broadleaf forest (EBF), along with the two major forest plantation types found in subtropical China, Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) forest (CFF) and Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) forest (MBF). Both SOC and Rs increased along the forest successional gradient with the climax EBF having both the highest SOC content of 33.1 +/- 4.9 g C kg(-1)(mean +/- standard error) and the highest Rs rate of 46.8 +/- 3.0 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1). It can be inferred that when EBF is converted to any of the other forest types, especially to MPF or CFF, both SOC content and Rs are likely to decline. Stand age did not significantly impact the SOC content or Rs rate in either types of plantation. Forest succession generally increases SOC content and Rs, and the conversion of natural forests to plantations decreases SOC content and Rs in subtropical China.",Carbon cycle; Evergreen broadleaf forest; Forest succession; Land-use and land-cover change; Soil organic carbon; Soil respiration

We are beginning to quantify soil oxygen availability in wetlands, but we lack a precise understanding of how oxygen controls soil carbon dynamics. In this paper, we synthesize existing data from oxic and anoxic wetland soil incubations to determine how oxygen controls carbon mineralization. We define the oxygen sensitivity of carbon mineralization as the ratio of carbon mineralization rate in oxic soil to this rate in anoxic soil, such that higher values of this ratio indicate greater sensitivity of carbon mineralization to oxygen. The estimates of oxygen sensitivity we derived from existing literature show a wide range of ratios, from 0.8 to 33, across wetlands. We then report oxygen sensitivities from an experimental mesocosm we developed to manipulate soil oxygen status in realistic soils. The variation in oxygen sensitivity we uncover from this systematic review and experiment indicates that Earth system models may misrepresent the oxygen sensitivity of carbon mineralization, and how it varies with context, in wetland soils. We suggest that altered soil oxygen availability could be an important driver of future blue carbon storage in coastal wetlands.",carbon mineralization; oxygen; blue carbon; oxic : anoxic ratios; coastal wetland

(a case study in guilan province, iran)","This work studied the effects of tree species composition on soil carbon storage in five mixed stands dominated by oriental beech and grown in the western Caspian region in Guilan province, called Astara, Asalem, Fuman, Chere and Shenrud. The thickness of the litter layer, soil characteristics, tree composition and percentage of canopy coverage were measured in each stand. Total soil organic carbon differed significantly by stand. Total (organic) carbon stores at Fuman, which had the lowest tree species richness with 2 species and least canopy coverage (75%), were significantly (p<0.05) higher than at other locations. Carbon storage in topsoil (0-10 cm) was significantly lower in Shenrud, which had the highest tree species richness with 5 species and highest canopy coverage (95%). The high percentage of canopy coverage in Shenrud probably limited the conversion of litter to humus. However, in the second soil layer (10-25 cm), Asalem, with high tree species richness and canopy coverage, had the highest carbon storage. This can be explained by the different rooting patterns of different tree species. In the Hyrcanian forest. According to the results, it can be concluded that not only tree composition but also canopy coverage percentage should be taken under consideration to manage soil carbon retention and release.",
722,excluded,Effect of water and straw management practices on methane emissions from rice fields: a review through a meta-analysis,"Rice fields contribute substantially to global warming of the atmosphere through emission of methane (CH4). This article reviews the state of the art of factors affecting CH4 emissions in rice fields, focusing on soil organic matter content and water management practices. A quantitative relationship between these factors was established through a meta-analysis based on a literature survey. This relationship can be useful to update emission factors used to estimate CH4 in the National Emission Inventories. Methane emissions in rice fields can be as much as 90% higher in continuously flooded rice fields compared with other water management practices, independent from straw addition. Water management systems that involve absence of flooding in total or for part of the growing period such as midseason drainages, intermittent flooding, and percolation control, can reduce CH4 emissions substantially. Moreover, CH4 emissions increase with the amount of straw added up to 7.7 t/ha for continuously flooded soils and up to 5.1 t/ha for other water regimes. Above these levels, no further increase is produced with further addition of straw. With regard to rice straw management mitigation strategies, recommended practices are composting rice straw, straw burning under controlled conditions, recollecting rice straw for biochar production, generation of energy, to be used as a substrate, or to obtain other byproducts with added value.

723,included,Irrigation leads to greater maize yield at higher water productivity and lower environmental costs: a global meta-analysis,"Irrigated maize production has increased in the world; however, a comprehensive assessment on how irrigation affects yield, water productivity (WP), and the environment under agricultural intensification on a global scale is paid little attention. In this study, we report the trade-offs among grain yield, WP, reactive nitrogen (N-r) losses, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in response to irrigation management using a global meta-analysis of field experimental data published in peer-reviewed journals prior to May 2018. A total of 1490 paired data points from 162 publications and 21 counties showed that grain yield increased by 30.35% from 7357 kg ha(-1) in non irrigated systems to 9512 kg ha(-1) in irrigation systems (146 mm). Similarly, WP increased by 9.91% from 19.1 to 20.5 kg ha(-1) mm(-1). These increases in yield and WP varied depending on seasonal irrigation amounts, precipitation levels, annual average temperature, N application, soil organic matter, and bulk density. Based on 270 peer-reviewed publications, the emission factors (EFs) of N-r losses in irrigation systems via NH3 emissions decreased by 9.3%, N2O emissions decreased by 42.3%, and NO3- leaching increased by 36.1%, compared with non-irrigated systems. Calculated yield-scaled N-r losses decreased by 10.3% from 5.94 kg N Mg-1 in non-irrigated systems to 5.32 kg N Mg-1 in irrigated systems. Correspondingly, yield-scaled GHG emissions including field emissions; fossil fuel from irrigation pumping, N, P, K fertilizer production and transportation; and field management were 22-28% lower under irrigated conditions than non-irrigated system. This finding highlights the multiple benefits of protecting environments and improving WP through irrigation to attain higher maize yield. However, there are trade-offs to this approach, including increased leaching and the risk of a future water resource crisis.",Irrigation; Yield; Water productivity; Environmental costs; Maize
724,excluded,Land use change and ecosystem service provision in Pampas and Campos grasslands of southern South America,"New livestock production models need to simultaneously meet the increasing global demand for meat and preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services. Since the 16th century beef cattle has been produced on the Pampas and Campos native grasslands in southern South America, with only small amounts of external inputs. Wesynthesised 242 references from peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 1945 and mid-2015 and analysed secondary data to examine the evidence on the ecosystem services provided by this grassland biodiversity hotspot and the way they are affected by land use changes and their drivers. The analysis followed the requirements of systematic review from the PRISMA statement (Moher et al 2009 Acad. Clin. Ann. Intern. Med. 151 264-9). The Pampas and Campos provide feed for 43 million heads of cattle and 14 million sheep. The biome is habitat of 4000 native plant species, 300 species of birds, 29 species of mammals, 49 species of reptiles and 35 species of amphibians. The soils of the region stock 5% of the soil organic carbon of Latin America on3% of its area. Driven by high prices of soybean, the soybean area increased by 210% between 2000 and 2010, at the expense of 2 million ha (5%) of native grassland, mostly in the Pampas. Intensification of livestock production was apparent in two spatially distinct forms. In subregions where cropping increased, intensification of livestock production was reflected in an increased use of grains for feed as part of feedlots. In subregions dominated by native grasslands, stocking rates increased. The review showed that land use change and grazing regimes with low forage allowances were predominantly associated with negative effects on ecosystem service provision by reducing soil organic carbon stocks and the diversity of plants, birds and mammals, and by increasing soil erosion. We found little quantitative information on changes in the ecosystem services water provision, nutrient cycling and erosion control. We discuss how changing grazing regimes to higher forage allowance can contribute to greater meat production and enhancing ecosystem services from native grasslands. This would require working with farmers on changing their management strategies and creating enabling economic conditions.",ecological intensification; meat production; biodiversity; sustainability; global change; food security; Rio de la Plata grasslands
725,excluded,Outcomes of evar with the endurant stent-graft system in patients with infrarenal ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms: is hostile anatomy a challenging factor?,"Purpose: To compare outcomes of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) using the Endurant-I stent-graft system between patients who have ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAAs) with normal and hostile anatomy. Materials and methods: Patients with rAAAs who underwent EVAR between January 2008 and March 2014 were included in the study. There were 21(70%) men and 9 (30%) women with a mean age of 70 years. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography findings of the rAAA were classified according to the ""Classification based on CT findings,"" and imaging planning was performed according to the Society of Interventional Radiology Guideline. Primary outcome measures (POM) were procedurerelated mortality, 30-day mortality, and survival rate at 1 year. Secondary outcome measures ( SOM) were technical success, open surgical conversion, complications, survival, relationship between size-severity of the rAAA and mortality, procedure time, hospital stay. Results: The periprocedural-EVAR mortality rate was 33%. The overall mortality rate without prehospital phase deaths was 40.0%. Seventy three percent of the patients with rAAAs had hostile anatomy. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in POMs and SOMs (except mean hospital stay). Mean hospital stay was shorter in the normal anatomy group. The mortality rate was higher in patients with hematoma in both sides of the aorta and free intraperitoneal hematoma. Conclusion: EVAR of rAAAs with hostile anatomy is feasible and off-label use of Endurant-I endografts could be expanded. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The present authors describe parental physical punishment towards children with intellectual disabilities and investigate its related demographic characteristics, SOC and parental mental health. Materials and MethodsWith the cooperation of Tokyo's 10 special needs schools, the present authors obtained 648 questionnaire responses from parents of children with intellectual disabilities. ResultsOf the parents, 69.7% reported having physically punished their children with intellectual disabilities. This was positively associated with parents' younger age, poorer mental health, lower SOC, children's younger age, birth order (firstborns) and disability type (autism/pervasive developmental disorder). ConclusionsThis is the first study supporting the relationship between SOC, mental health and physical punishment use among parents of children with intellectual disabilities. It may assist the development of strategies to prevent physical abuse of children with disabilities.",children with intellectual disability; mental health; physical punishment; sense of coherence
727,excluded,Vascular and cardiac functional and structural screening to identify risk of future morbid events: preliminary observations,"Risk factors have served to identify patients in need of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy. Because of their limited sensitivity and specificity, we developed a screening program using noninvasive testing and a scoring system aimed at detecting functional and structural cardiovascular abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals. Ten cardiovascular tests were performed in I hour by a single technologist. Tests were scored as normal (0), borderline abnormal (1), or abnormal (2). Total disease score (DS) could range from 0 (all tests normal) to 20 (all tests abnormal). Scores of 0-2 were classified as normal, 3-5 as early disease, and 6+ as advanced disease. Morbid events during follow-up of 6 months to 8 years were determined from mailed questionnaires. Framingham risk scores (FRS) were calculated using published algorithms. Thirty-five morbid events (1 of 169 in the ""normal"" group, 8 of 214 in the ""early disease"" group, and 26 of 230 in the ""advanced disease"" group) occurred during the follow-up period among the 613 individuals who completed the questionnaire. Risk for morbid events was highly significantly different between the Kaplan-Meier curves based on disease detection (log rank 21.75, P <= .0001). FRS were significantly different but less discriminating, with five morbid events in the 227 subjects with FRS <10, eight in 162 with FRS 10-13, and 22 of 227 with FRS >13 (log rank 9.80, P = .0074). The area under receiver operating characteristic curve for DS (0.74) surpassed that of FRS (0.66) and was not improved when both were included in the model. Neither blood pressure levels nor low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels provided adequate discrimination. Identifying early disease in asymptomatic individuals provides a better guide to the need for preventive therapy than traditional risk factor assessment. J Am Soc Hypertens 2011;5(5):401-409.

728,excluded,Clinician reported ease of use for a novel fibrin sealant patch for hemostasis: results from four randomized controlled trials,"Background: In addition to rapid and sustained efficacy, ease of use is also an important characteristic of topical hemostats. Objectives: To evaluate clinician-reported ease of use for the Evarrest* fibrin sealant patch across various surgical bleeding situations. Methods: An ease of use questionnaire (EUQ) was validated and administered in four randomized studies comparing the fibrin sealant patch to standard of care (SoC) in soft tissue and hepatic surgical bleeding. Three of these randomized studies have been previously published and all have been registered (NCT00658723; NCT00977925; NCT01166243; NCT01993888). The EUQ is a 19 item instrument evaluating clinician's preferences on five subscales: product ease of use, satisfaction with product properties and efficiency, confidence in product efficacy, global confidence, and global satisfaction. A pair-wise meta-analysis using a random effects model was conducted on EUQ scores for trials that reported data for both treatment arms. Individual scores are presented for each trial. Results: The fibrin sealant patch demonstrated numerically greater scores than SoC in all EUQ subscales. The meta-analysis demonstrated that fibrin sealant patch scores improved for all subscales compared with SoC: satisfaction with product properties (mean difference [ MD] = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.73; P = 0.03), confidence in efficacy (MD = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.74; P = 0.0007), global confidence (MD = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.05 to 1.10, P = 0.03), global satisfaction (MD = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.32 to 1.26, P = 0.001), and ease of use (MD = 0.33, 95% CI: -0.29 to 0.94; P = 0.23). Fibrin sealant patch single arm trial results aligned with these findings. Conclusions: Physicians consistently reported high EUQ scores for the fibrin sealant patch across surgical bleeding populations. An important limitation of this study was that the composition of SoC varied across studies and EUQ data were only available for the SoC in two of four trials. Future studies should evaluate ease of use for other hemostats and across other surgical subspecialties, as data are currently limited.",Bleeding; Fibrin sealant; Hemostatics; Questionnaire; Surgery
729,excluded,"Changes in soil particulate organic matter, microbial biomass, and activity following afforestation of marginal agricultural lands in a semi-arid area of northeast china","Afforestation of agricultural lands has been one of the major land use changes in China in recent decades. To better understand the effect of such land use change on soil quality, we investigated selected soil physical, chemical and microbial properties (0-15 cm depth) in marginal agricultural land and a chronosequence of poplar (Populus euramericana cv. 'N3016') plantations (5-, 10-, 15- and 20-years old) in a semi-arid area of Northeast China. Soil bulk density significantly declined after conversion of agricultural lands to poplar plantations. Soil total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (TN) concentrations, microbial biomass C (MBC) and potential N mineralization rate (PNM) decreased initially following afforestation of agricultural lands, and then increased with stand development. However, soil metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) exhibited a reverse trend. In addition, soil particulate organic matter C (POM-C) and N (POM-N) concentrations showed no significant changes in the first 10 years following afforestation, and then increased with stand age. These findings demonstrated that soil quality declined initially following afforestation of agricultural lands in semi-arid regions, and then recovered with stand development. Following 15 years of afforestation, many soil quality parameters recovered to the values found in agricultural land. We propose that change in soil quality with stand age should be considered in determining optimum rotation length of plantations and best management practices for afforestation programs.",
730,excluded,Accuracy of right ventricular volumes and function determined by three-dimensional echocardiography in comparison with magnetic resonance imaging: a meta-analysis study,"Background: Determining right ventricular (RV) function is challenging because of the complex anatomy of the right ventricle. Three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) has achieved better estimation, but underestimations of volumes and ejection fraction (EF) has often been reported, and no previous study has synthesized these data. The investigators performed a meta-analysis on the bias and examined the related factors. Methods: Studies comparing RV volumes and/or EF between 3DE and magnetic resonance imaging were eligible. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the systematic bias. The related bias was investigated using univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Results: Twenty-three studies including 807 subjects revealed underestimation of RV volumes (P < .00001) and EF (P = .03). Larger volumes and EF were associated with more underestimation. Older patient age was associated with overestimation of volumes and underestimation of EF. Conclusions: This meta-analysis found underestimation of RV volumes and EF by 3DE and factors affecting the bias. These data provide a more detailed basis for improving the accuracy of 3DE for further clinical application. (J Am Soc Echocardiogr 2010;23:943-53.)",
731,excluded,A systemic organizational change model in occupational health management,"One of the principal research areas in occupational health concerns the theory and methodology best suitable to reduce the occurrence of health-adverse outcomes in the workplace. The concept 'organizational intervention' is commonly used in occupational health to refer to modifications of work structures and processes in organizations in order to reduce health risks. Nonetheless, several reviews of the literature on organizational interventions have identified major deficiencies related to the lack of theoretical development and validity assessment, and how and why this type of interventions may succeed in reducing health risks. In the present contribution, these research deficiencies are to some extent addressed by developing a more congruent model of health-related organizational change, the Systemic Organizational Change in Occupational Health (SOC-OH) model. The main objective of the present conceptual study is to propose a multilevel model of organizational change that is based on empirical evidence and integrates organizational structures, social-psychological group phenomena and individual health behaviour. The SOC-OH is formulated in a series of propositions which can be used in empirical research to evaluate the appropriateness and scientific validity of the model.",Organizational change; occupational health; socio-technical systems; consensus
732,excluded,Predictive factors in the quality of life of cancer inpatients,"The purpose of the study was to determine whether sense of coherence (SOC), and demographic variables (age, gender, race, education, length of illness) predict quality of life (QOL) in cancer inpatients. SOC is the extent to which one finds life comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful. Participants were 49 inpatients (66% female) with various forms of cancer, mostly African American (71%), with a mean age of 54.5 years. The mean QOLS of cancer inpatients (84.6) was lower than a healthy population (90.0), however, their mean item scores indicated that they are ""mostly satisfied"" with most areas of QOL except for active forms of past-time and health. The mean SOC score (133.8) was also lower than other groups; however without appropriate norms, it cannot be concluded that cancer inpatients have a weak SOC. Multiple regressions showed that SOC was a significant predictor of QOL, and that the demographic variables were not predictive of QOL, except when combined with SOC. All findings may be limited by demographics of the sample (race, gender, age, severity of illness), and the inability of cross-sectional investigations to determine causality.",
733,included,"A critical review of the impacts of cover crops on nitrogen leaching, net greenhouse gas balance and crop productivity","Abstract Cover crops play an increasingly important role in improving soil quality, reducing agricultural inputs and improving environmental sustainability. The main objectives of this critical global review and systematic analysis were to assess cover crop practices in the context of their impacts on nitrogen leaching, net greenhouse gas balances (NGHGB) and crop productivity. Only studies that investigated the impacts of cover crops and measured one or a combination of nitrogen leaching, soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrous oxide (N2O), grain yield and nitrogen in grain of primary crop, and had a control treatment were included in the analysis. Long-term studies were uncommon, with most data coming from studies lasting 2–3 years. The literature search resulted in 106 studies carried out at 372 sites and covering different countries, climatic zones and management. Our analysis demonstrates that cover crops significantly (p < 0.001) decreased N leaching and significantly (p < 0.001) increased SOC sequestration without having significant (p > 0.05) effects on direct N2O emissions. Cover crops could mitigate the NGHGB by 2.06 ± 2.10 Mg CO2-eq ha−1 year−1. One of the potential disadvantages of cover crops identified was the reduction in grain yield of the primary crop by ≈4%, compared to the control treatment. This drawback could be avoided by selecting mixed cover crops with a range of legumes and non-legumes, which increased the yield by ≈13%. These advantages of cover crops justify their widespread adoption. However, management practices in relation to cover crops will need to be adapted to specific soil, management and regional climatic conditions.",C sequestration; catch crop; cover crop; green manure; N content; N in; grain; N leaching; net greenhouse gas balance; nitrate; nitrous oxide; emissions; soil organic carbon; yield
734,excluded,Interventions to promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy in africa: a network meta-analysis,"Background Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is necessary for the improvement of the health of patients and for public health. We sought to determine the comparative effectiveness of different interventions for improving ART adherence in HIV-infected people living in Africa. Methods We searched for randomised trials of interventions to promote antiretroviral adherence within adults in Africa. We searched AMED, CINAHL, Embase, Medline (via PubMed), and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to Oct 31, 2014, with the terms ""HIV"", ""ART"", ""adherence"", and ""Africa"". We created a network of the interventions by pooling the published and individual patients' data for comparable treatments and comparing them across the individual interventions with Bayesian network meta-analyses. The primary outcome was adherence defined as the proportion of patients meeting trial defined criteria; the secondary endpoint was viral suppression. Findings We obtained data for 14 randomised controlled trials, with 7110 patients. Interventions included daily and weekly short message service (SMS; text message) messaging, calendars, peer supporters, alarms, counselling, and basic and enhanced standard of care (SOC). Compared with SOC, we found distinguishable improvement in self-reported adherence with enhanced SOC (odds ratio [OR] 1 . 46, 95% credibility interval [CrI] 1.06-1.98), weekly SMS messages (1.65, 1.25-2.18), counselling and SMS combined (2.07, 1.22-3.53), and treatment supporters (1.83, 1.36-2.45). We found no compelling evidence for the remaining interventions. Results were similar when using viral suppression as an outcome, although the network contained less evidence than that for adherence. Treatment supporters with enhanced SOC (1.46, 1.09-1.97) and weekly SMS messages (1.55, 1.01-2.38) were significantly better than basic SOC. Interpretation Several recommendations for improving adherence are unsupported by the available evidence. These findings can inform future intervention choices for improving ART adherence in low-income settings.",
735,excluded,Gender determinants of vaccination status in children: evidence from a meta-ethnographic systematic review,"Using meta-ethnographic methods, we conducted a systematic review of qualitative research to understand gender-related reasons at individual, family, community and health facility levels why millions of children in low and middle income countries are still not reached by routine vaccination programmes. A systematic search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, ERIC, Anthropological Lit, CSA databases, IBSS, ISI Web of Knowledge, JSTOR, Soc Index and Sociological Abstracts was conducted. Key words were built around the themes of immunization, vaccines, health services, health behaviour, and developing countries. Only papers, which reported on in-depth qualitative data, were retained. Twenty-five qualitative studies, which investigated barriers to routine immunisation, were included in the review. These studies were conducted between 1982 and 2012; eighteen were published after 2000. The studies represent a wide range of low-to middle income countries including some that have well known coverage challenges. We found that women's low social status manifests on every level as a barrier to accessing vaccinations: access to education, income, as well as autonomous decision-making about time and resource allocation were evident barriers. Indirectly, women's lower status made them vulnerable to blame and shame in case of childhood illness, partly reinforcing access problems, but partly increasing women's motivation to use every means to keep their children healthy. Yet in settings where gender discrimination exists most strongly, increasing availability and information may not be enough to reach the under immunised. Programmes must actively be designed to include mitigation measures to facilitate women's access to immunisation services if we hope to improve immunisation coverage. Gender inequality needs to be addressed on structural, community and household levels if the number of unvaccinated children is to substantially decrease.",
736,excluded,Multiple ecosystem services provision and biomass logistics management in bioenergy buffers: a state-of-the-art review,"Bioenergy buffers are linear landscape elements cultivated with perennial herbaceous or woody biomass crops placed along arable field margins and watercourses. This systematic review evaluates the potential impact of bioenergy buffers on multiple ecosystem services (ES) provision while describing key factors along the biomass supply chain. An Impact Assessment (IA) methodology was adopted to capture the direction and the level of confidence of impact on multiple ES including regulating (climate, water and biodiversity), supporting (soil health) and provisioning services (biomass and energy yield). The IA revealed that the implementation of bioenergy buffers on previous croplands rather than on grasslands sustains long-term provision of multiple ES such as climate, water quality and biodiversity regulation and soil health. Herbaceous buffers were found to be more effective than woody buffers in the provision of multiple ES. Knowledge gaps relative to climate and water quality regulation services were identified for the establishment phase of bioenergy buffers (0-3y). Regarding biomass logistics, the limited operating space for farm machinery was the main shortcoming when comparing bioenergy buffers to large-scale bioenergy plantations. The intra- and inter-farm spatial fragmentation of biomass supply areas may increase environmental costs related to biomass collection and transport operations, but this has not yet been fully tested. Establishing a network of bioenergy buffers increases landscape connectivity and the overall area of ES provision in the agricultural landscape. Payments for ES obtained from bioenergy buffers can ultimately improve the economics of sustainable bioenergy and help achieving environmental goals of EU policies on water, soil and biodiversity protection.",Land use conflicts; Bioenergy buffers; Energy crops; Impact matrix; Ecosystem services; Miscanthus; Switchgrass; Willow; Poplar; Biomass supply chain

Extracellular enzymes have not been represented in global biogeochemical models. Understanding the relationships among EEA and SOC, soil N (TN), and soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) under N fertilization would enable modeling of the influence of EEA on SOC decomposition. Based on 65 published studies, we synthesized the activities of alpha-1,4-glucosidase (AG), beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG), beta-D-cellobiosidase (CBH), beta-1,4-xylosidase (BX), beta-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG), leucine amino peptidase (LAP), urease (UREA), acid phosphatase (AP), phenol oxidase (PHO), and peroxidase (PEO) in response to N fertilization. The proxy variables for hydrolytic C acquisition enzymes (C-acq), N acquisition (N-acq), and oxidative decomposition (OX) were calculated as the sum of AG, BG, CBH and BX; AG and LAP; PHO and PEO, respectively. The relationships between response ratios (RRs) of EEA and SOC, TN, or. MBC were explored when they were reported simultaneously. Results showed that N fertilization significantly increased CBH, C-acq, AP, BX, BG, AG, and UREA activities by 6.4, 9.1, 10.6, 11.0, 11.2, 12.0, and 18.6%, but decreased PEO, OX and PHO by 6.1, 7.9 and 11.1%, respectively. N fertilization enhanced SOC and TN by 7.6% and 15.3%, respectively, but inhibited MBC by 9.5%. Significant positive correlations were found only between the RRs of C-acq and MBC, suggesting that changes in combined hydrolase activities might act as a proxy for MBC under N fertilization. In contrast with other variables, the RRs of AP, MBC, and TN showed unidirectional trends under different edaphic, environmental, and physiological conditions. Our results provide the first comprehensive set of evidence of how hydrolase and oxidase activities respond to N fertilization in various ecosystems. Future large-scale model projections could incorporate the observed relationship between hydrolases and microbial biomass as a proxy for C acquisition under global N enrichment scenarios in different ecosystems.

Methods A systematic search up to April 2015 was carried out using the following electronic bibliographic databases: PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE; ISI Web of Science; and Ovid PsychInfo. Studies were included if they evaluated the relationship between SOC and oral health behaviors including tooth cleaning, fluoride usage, dietary habits, dental attendance, and smoking. We excluded studies that only assessed the relationship between oral health status and SOC without evaluating oral health behaviors. The New Castle Ottawa (NOS) quality assessment checklist was employed to evaluate the methodological quality of included studies. Results Thirty-nine potential papers met the preliminary selection criteria and following a full-text review, 9 papers were finally selected for this systematic review. Results provided by the included studies indicated different levels of association between SOC and oral health behaviors. The most frequent behaviors investigated were tooth brushing and dental attendance pattern. The impact of SOC on performing positive oral health behaviors, to some extent, was related to demographic and socio-economic factors. In addition, mothers' SOC influenced children's oral health practices. Conclusions A more favorable oral health behavior was observed among those with a stronger SOC suggesting that the SOC can be a determinant of oral health-related behaviors including tooth brushing frequency, daily smoking, and dental attendance.",
739,included,Crop yields under no-till farming in China: A meta-analysis,"No-till (NT) farming is popular globally, however, the effects on crop yields remain debatable. A meta analysis was conducted on crop yield responses to NT in China based on 1006 comparisons from 164 studies. Results showed that a decrease of 2.1 +/- 1.8% on crop yield was observed under NT with residue removed (NTO) compared with that under plow tillage with residue removed (PTO), but the decreases can be diminished to 1.9 +/- 1.0% when residue retention was combined with both the two tillage practices. On the contrary, NT with residue retention (NTR) may significantly increase crop yields by 4.6 +/- 1.3% compared with that under PTO (P < 0.05). Along with improvements in crop yields, increases in soil organic carbon (SOC) by 10.2 7.2%, available nitrogen (N) by 9.4 +/- 5.4%, available potassium by 10.5 +/- 8.8%, and water storage by 9.3 +/- 2.4% was observed under NTR compared with PTO, indicating that improvements in soil quality could benefit crop productivity under NTR. Categorically, results on meta-analysis and regression indicated large variations in crop yields under NTR because of differences in crop species, temperature and precipitation, antecedent SOC level, N fertilizer input, duration of adoption, and with or without residue retention. For example, crop yields significantly increased with increase in duration (P < 0.0001) under NTR, by 21.3% after 10 years of continuous NTR compared with PTO. Adoption of NTR under appropriate site-specific conditions can advance China's food security, improve yield stability and alleviate soil-related constraints. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

740,excluded,Perennial grain crop roots and nitrogen management shape soil food webs and soil carbon dynamics,"Perennial grain crops may confer greater ecosystem services relative to annual row crop systems due to their extensive roots systems and year-round ground cover. However, less is known about the extent to which perennial grain crops affect food web dynamics and soil carbon (C) cycling over time. Furthermore, many mechanistic questions remain regarding the influence of root quantity and quality on soil biological communities and C cycling function. In this study, we quantified root biomass and quality, bacterial and nematode community structure, and labile soil C pools of perennial intermediate wheatgrass [Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Buckworth and Dewey] and annual winter wheat (Triticum aes L.) across three nitrogen (N) management systems (Organic, Low inorganic N, High inorganic N). After 4 years, the perennial grain crop had significantly greater root quantity and permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) relative to annual wheat. Mineralizable C was similar between the two plant systems but differed by N management. Perenniality more than management influenced nematode community structure and function; perennial grains increased the structure index (a measure of trophic complexity) by 55% compared to annual wheat. Both plant type and management influenced bacterial communities, but not until the final year of the experiment. Our findings demonstrate that established perennial grain crops increase labile soil C and support more highly structured and complex food webs relative to annual cropping systems.",Organic matter; Root biomass; Nematodes; Bacteria; Soil food webs
741,excluded,Closing water productivity gaps to achieve food and water security for a global maize supply,"To achieve food and water security, it is as important to close the water productivity (WP) gap (which was defined as the difference between the maximum attainable WP and the currently achieved WP at the field scale) as it is to close yield gaps. However, few studies have provided quantitative estimates of existing WP gaps and constraining factors for global maize production. Using a meta-analysis of 473 published studies covering 31 countries and 5,553 observations (932 site-years), we found the global average WP value for irrigated maize was 18.6 kg ha(-1) mm(-1). These WPs varied by factors such as seasonal precipitation, irrigation regimes, soil organic matter and soil pH. In current production systems, there exists a huge scope for improvement in maize WP, but the reported field experiments achieved only 20-46% of potential WP across all countries. Considering the future, raising WP to 85% of potential WP by 2050, a 100% increase in maize production could be achieved with 20% less planted area and 21% less water consumption than in 2005. Closing the WP gap may be critical to ensuring food security and achieving sustainable global agriculture.",

Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify all multicomponent frailty assessment tools (ie, a tool that assesses two or more indicators of frailty). The items of each frailty assessment tool were compared with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders to assess construct overlap. Studies conducted in community, inpatient, and outpatient clinical settings were considered for inclusion. Participants Adults aged 60 years or older. Results A total of 5639 records were identified following the removal of duplicates, from which 95 studies were included for review. Of the 48 multicomponent frailty assessment tools identified, no tool had been developed for, or validated in, older adult populations with a psychiatric disorder. Overall, 20 of 48 frailty assessment tools contained a psychological assessment domain, with 17 of 48 tools citing the presence of depressed mood and/or anxiety as a frailty indicator. Common areas of construct overlap in frailty assessment tools and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria included weight loss (29 of 48) and fatigue (21 of 48). Conclusions Significant construct overlap exists between the indicators of frailty as conceptualized in existing frailty assessment tools and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for common psychiatric disorders including major depressive episode and generalized anxiety disorder that has the potential to confound frailty assessment results. Further research is necessary to establish a reliable and valid tool to assess frailty in this population. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:1085-1095, 2019.",frailty assessment; psychiatric disorder
743,excluded,Soil carbon fluxes and stocks in a great lakes forest chronosequence,"We measured soil respiration and soil carbon stocks, as well as micrometeorological variables in a chronosequence of deciduous forests in Wisconsin and Michigan. The chronosequence consisted of (1) four recently disturbed stands, including a clearcut and repeatedly burned stand (burn), a blowdown and partial salvage stand (blowdown), a clearcut with sparse residual overstory (residual), and a regenerated stand from a complete clearcut (regenerated); (2) four young aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands in average age of 10 years; (3) four intermediate aspen stands in average age of 26 years; (4) four mature northern hardwood stands in average age of 73 years; and (5) an old-growth stand approximately 350-years old. We fitted site-based models and used continuous measurements of soil temperature to estimate cumulative soil respiration for the growing season of 2005 (days 133-295). Cumulative soil respiration in the growing season was estimated to be 513, 680, 747, 747, 794, 802, 690, and 571 g C m(-2) in the burn, blowdown, residual, regenerated, young, intermediate, mature, and old-growth stands, respectively. The measured apparent temperature sensitivity of soil respiration was the highest in the regenerated stand, and declined from the young stands to the old-growth. Both, cumulative soil respiration and basal soil respiration at 10 degrees C, increased during stand establishment, peaked at intermediate age, and then decreased with age. Total soil carbon at 0-60 cm initially decreased after harvest, and increased after stands established. The old-growth stand accumulated carbon in deep layers of soils, but not in the surface soils. Our study suggests a complexity of long-term soil carbon dynamics, both in vertical depth and temporal scale.",
744,excluded,Early angiography in patients with chronic kidney disease: a collaborative systematic review,"Background and objectives: In the general population, an early invasive strategy of routine coronary angiography is superior to a conservative strategy of selective angiography in patients who are admitted with unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI), but the effectiveness of this strategy in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncertain. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: We conducted a collaborative meta-analysis with data provided by the main authors of identified trials to estimate the effectiveness of early angiography in patients with CKD. The Cochrane, Medline, and EMBASE databases were searched to identify randomized trials that compared invasive and conservative strategies in patients with unstable angina or non-ST MI. Pooled risks ratios were estimated using data from enrolled patients with estimated GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Results: Five randomized trials that enrolled 1453 patients with CKD were included. An early invasive strategy was associated with nonsignificant reductions in all-cause mortality, nonfatal MI, and a composite of death or nonfatal MI. The invasive strategy significantly reduced rehospitalization. Conclusions: This collaborative study suggests that the benefits of an early invasive strategy are preserved in patients with CKD and that an early invasive approach reduces the risk for rehospitalization and is associated with trends of reduction in the risk for death and nonfatal re-infarction in patients with CKD. Coronary angiography should be considered for patients who have CKD and are admitted with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes.

Methods: From February 2002 to April 2007, we retrospectively studied the clinical Outcome of 138 cases of adult inguinal hernia patients who had operations performed with the use of mesh. Three types of mesh operations were composed of Lichtenstein repair group (LR group; N=18), Mesh Plug repair group (MR group; N=38) and Prolene hernia system group (PHS group; N=82). The clinical features and outcomes of the three groups were compared by age, sex, operation time, lengths of hospital stay, numbers of post-operative intravenous analgesics, complications, and recurrence. Results: Mean age of three groups was 50.2+/-20.7, 51.0+/-18-4 and 61.5+/-15.9 years for LR. MR, PHS groups, respectively. The PHS group was significantly older than other two groups (P=0.002). The sex, operation time and lengths of hospital stay were not significantly different among the three groups. Numbers of intravenous analgesics used after the operations were 1.7+/-1.2, 2.7+/-2.2, 3.3+/-20 in the LR, MR, PHS groups, respectively. A lesser amount of IV analgesics was injected into the LR group than the PHS group. Although some complications occurred such as wound infection, hematoma, dehiscence, testicular edema in the three groups, there were no significant differences among the three groups. There were no recurrences in all three groups. Conclusion: We could not find any better outcome among the LR, MR and PHS groups. (J Korean Surg Soc 2009;76:109-114)",
746,included,Animal manure application and soil organic carbon stocks: a meta-analysis,"The impact of animal manure application on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock changes is of interest for both agronomic and environmental purposes. There is a specific need to quantify SOC change for use in national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories. We quantified the response of SOC stocks to manure application from a large worldwide pool of individual studies and determined the impact of explanatory factors such as climate, soil properties, land use and manure characteristics. Our study is based on a meta-analysis of 42 research articles totaling 49 sites and 130 observations in the world. A dominant effect of cumulative manure-C input on SOC response was observed as this factor explained at least 53% of the variability in SOC stock differences compared to mineral fertilized or unfertilized reference treatments. However, the effects of other determining factors were not evident from our data set. From the linear regression relating cumulative C inputs and SOC stock difference, a global manure-C retention coefficient of 12%+/- 4 (95% Confidence Interval, CI) could be estimated for an average study duration of 18years. Following an approach comparable to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we estimated a relative SOC change factor of 1.26 +/- 0.14 (95% CI) which was also related to cumulative manure-C input. Our results offer some scope for the refinement of manure retention coefficients used in crop management guidelines and for the improvement of SOC change factors for national GHG inventories by taking into account manure-C input. Finally, this study emphasizes the need to further document the long-term impact of manure characteristics such as animal species, especially pig and poultry, and manure management systems, in particular liquid vs. solid storage.",animal manure; manure carbon input; manure retention coefficient; meta-analysis; soil carbon change factor; soil organic carbon
747,excluded,Management controls the net greenhouse gas outcomes of growing bioenergy feedstocks on marginally productive croplands,"Bio-based energy is key to developing a globally sustainable low-carbon economy. Lignocellulosic feedstock production on marginally productive croplands is expected to provide substantial climate mitigation benefits, but long-term field research comparing greenhouse gas (GHG) outcomes during the production of annual versus perennial crop-based feedstocks is lacking. Here, we show that long-term (16 years) switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) systems mitigate GHG emissions during the feedstock production phase compared to GHG-neutral continuous corn (Zea mays L.) under conservation management on marginally productive cropland. Increased soil organic carbon was the major GHG sink in all feedstock systems, but net agronomic GHG outcomes hinged on soil nitrous oxide emissions controlled by nitrogen (N) fertilizer rate. This long-term field study is the first to demonstrate that annual crop and perennial grass systems respectively maintain or mitigate atmospheric GHG contributions during the agronomic phase of bioenergy production, providing flexibility for land-use decisions on marginally productive croplands.",
748,included,Different responses of soil organic carbon fractions to additions of nitrogen,"Carbon-nitrogen (C-N) interactions in terrestrial ecosystems regulate climate-C cycle feedbacks. How additions of N affect soil C sequestration and then regulate climate change, however, are not fully understood. Previous studies have assessed effects of N on bulk soil organic C (SOC) but have not yet carefully examined its effects on different SOC fractions, which determine how fast the N-regulated C cycle feeds back to climate. Here we synthesized data from 36 studies with 296 observations by a meta-analysis to evaluate the responses of SOC fractions to N additions. We hypothesized that additions of N might increase both labile and non-labile C fractions. The SOC that was separated by density fractionation increased by 18.3% for free light fractions and by 3.0% for heavy density fractions without change in the occluded light fraction under N addition compared with the control. The SOC that was separated by aggregate fractionation increased by 4.4% for macroaggregate-associated fractions and by 6.5% for aggregate mineral-associated fractions without change in the microaggregate-associated fraction under N additions. When bulk SOC was separated by chemical permanganate oxidation, the oxidizable fraction increased by 10.4%, whereas the unoxidizable fraction increased by 4.5%. The changes in different soil C fractions were related to the mechanisms of SOC stabilization. Because of the significant increases in non-labile SOC fractions, our findings suggest that on a global scale, increased additions of N might promote SOC accumulation and slow down climate change in the long term. Our results will be useful in model development for better prediction of SOC sequestration under additions of N.",climatic change. organic matter in soil. worldwide. carbon. carbon sequestration. climate. climate change. data analysis. density. ecosystems. fractionation. interactions. meta-analysis. nitrogen. organic carbon. oxidation. soil. soil chemistry. soil organic matter. soil science. stabilization.

749,included,A global meta-analysis of soil respiration and its components in response to phosphorus addition,"Increasing phosphorus (P) deposition induced by anthropogenic activities has increased the availability of P, and thus could affect ecosystem carbon cycling. Although soil respiration (R-s) plays a crucial role in driving the global carbon cycle and regulating climate warming, a general pattern reflecting the R-s response to P addition in terrestrial ecosystems remains unclear. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis from 102 publications to explore the generalities and mechanisms of responses of R-s and its components to P addition across various ecosystems at the global scale. Our results showed that P addition did not significantly change R-s and heterotrophic respiration (R-h) across all ecosystems, but this P addition effect varied among ecosystem types (p < 0.05). Specifically, P addition significantly increased R-s by 17.4% in tropical forest and by 31.7% in cropland, depressed R-s by 13.7% in wetland (p < 0.05), and had minor effect in other ecosystems (grassland, boreal forest, and temperate forest). In contrast, P addition did not have significant effect on R-h within any specific ecosystem type. Among multiple environmental and experimental variables, mean annual temperature might be the fundamental driver indirectly controlling the response of R-s to P addition at the large scale. In addition, P addition increased soil P availability, and changed ecosystem carbon pools and fluxes. The responses of R-s and R-h were significantly positively correlated with those of soil organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and belowground biomass, respectively, suggesting that changes of these carbon pools may drive the responses of R-s and R-h to P addition. Collectively, our findings imply that R-s in tropical forests would strongly respond to P enrichment where current soil P availability is low and future P deposition rate is high, provide a framework for understanding R-s dynamics under global P deposition, and highlight the need for further field studies partitioning the two components of R-s.",Soil respiration; Soil organic matter decomposition; Root respiration; Phosphorus deposition; Phosphorus limitation; Tropical forest

Different production practices and soil fertility has profound effects on the yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in northern China. A meta analysis of 6470 observations from 175 research papers for studies done across 77 locations in northern China was undertaken with respect to grain yield (GY) of winter wheat as influenced by soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorous (AP), and available potassium (AK) under common production practices. The results were as follows: (1) Mulching and tillage increased GY by 13.2 and 7.8% relative to that from conventional tillage, respectively. (2) GY, spike number (SN), and grain number per ear (GNE) were markedly affected by mineral nitrogen (N) application rate at 200-285 kg ha(-1). (3) Application of N affected GY nearly three times more than mulching combined with tillage did, and the effect of N being evident mainly in SN and GNE. (4) SOM at 10-14.9 g kg(-1), TN at 1-1.5 g kg(-1), AP at 10-19.8 mg kg(-1), and AK at 100-200 mg kg(-1) were the most effective soil fertility levels to improve wheat GY among all the research levels.",Wheat yield; Management practices; Soil quality
751,included,Does the combined application of organic and mineral nutrient sources influence maize productivity? A meta-analysis,"The combined application of organic resources (ORs) and mineral fertilizers is increasingly gaining recognition as a viable approach to address soil fertility decline in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We conducted a meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive and quantitative synthesis of conditions under which ORs, N fertilizers, and combined ORs with N fertilizers positively or negatively influence Zea mays (maize) yields, agronomic N use efficiency and soil organic C (SOC) in SSA. Four OR quality classes were assessed; classes I (high quality) and II (intermediate quality) had > 2.5% N while classes III (intermediate quality) and IV (low quality) had < 2.5% N and classes I and III had < 4% polyphenol and < 15% lignin. On the average, yield responses over the control were 60%, 84% and 114% following the addition of ORs, N fertilizers and ORs + N fertilizers, respectively. There was a general increase in yield responses with increasing OR quality and OR-N quantity, both when ORs were added alone or with N fertilizers. Surprisingly, greater OR residual effects were observed with high quality ORs and declined with decreasing OR quality. The greater yield responses with ORs + N fertilizers than either resource alone were mostly due to extra N added and not improved N utilization efficiency because negative interactive effects were, most often, observed when combining ORs with N fertilizers. Additionally, their agronomic N use efficiency was not different from sole added ORs but lower than N fertilizers added alone. Nevertheless, positive interactive effects were observed in sandy soils with low quality ORs whereas agronomic use efficiency was greater when smaller quantities of N were added in all soils. Compared to sole added ORs, yield responses for the combined treatment increased with decreasing OR quality and greater yield increases were observed in sandy (68%) than clayey soils (25%). While ORs and ORs + N fertilizer additions increased SOC by at least 12% compared to the control, N fertilizer additions were not different from control suggesting that ORs are needed to increase SOC. Thus, the addition of ORs will likely improve nutrient storage while crop yields are increased and more so for high quality ORs. Furthermore, interactive effects are seldom occurring, but agronomic N use efficiency of ORs + N fertilizers were greater with low quantities of N added, offering potential for increasing crop productivity.",Organic resource quality; Interactive effects; Integrated soil fertility; management; Yield response; Meta-analysis; Agronomic N use efficiency; N; fertilizer
752,included,A review of nitrogen enrichment effects on three biogenic GHGs: the CO2 sink may be largely offset by stimulated N2O and CH4 emission,"Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enrichment of ecosystems, mainly from fuel combustion and fertilizer application, alters biogeochemical cycling of ecosystems in a way that leads to altered flux of biogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs). Our meta-analysis of 313 observations across 109 studies evaluated the effect of N addition on the flux of three major GHGs: CO2, CH4 and N2O. The objective was to quantitatively synthesize data from agricultural and non-agricultural terrestrial ecosystems across the globe and examine whether factors, such as ecosystem type, N addition level and chemical form of N addition influence the direction and magnitude of GHG fluxes. Results indicate that N addition increased ecosystem carbon content of forests by 6%, marginally increased soil organic carbon of agricultural systems by 2%, but had no significant effect on net ecosystem CO2 exchange for non-forest natural ecosystems. Across all ecosystems, N addition increased CH4 emission by 97%, reduced CH4 uptake by 38% and increased N2O emission by 216%. The net effect of N on the global GHG budget is calculated and this topic is reviewed. Most often N addition is considered to increase forest C sequestration without consideration of N stimulation of GHG production in other ecosystems. However, our study indicated that although N addition increased the global terrestrial C sink, the CO2 reduction could be largely offset (53-76%) by N stimulation of global CH4 and N2O emission from multiple ecosystems.",Agricultural system; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; emission; uptake factor; forest; global GHG budget; methane; N deposition; N; saturation; nitrous oxide; wetland

The cost-effectiveness of MIDO and standard of care (SOC) followed by MIDO monotherapy was compared to SOC alone for newly-diagnosed FLT3+AML in the UK. Methods: A partitioned survival model was developed from a UK public healthcare system perspective to compare the cost-effectiveness of MIDO plus SOC and SOC over a lifetime horizon. The model included the following health states/partitions: induction, consolidation, monotherapy, complete remission (CR), relapse, stem cell transplantation (SCT), SCT recovery, and post-SCT recovery. Data on CR, overall survival, and adverse events were obtained from a Phase III clinical trial. Overall survival was extrapolated beyond the trial horizon using a'cure model'approach and data from the Office for National Statistics. Utilities were identified via a systematic review. Routine care utilization was obtained from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence single technology appraisal for azacitidine in AML (TA399). The costs of drugs and administration, adverse events, hospitalizations, physician visits, and end-of-life care were incorporated. Results: Incremental life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by patients on MIDO and SOC versus SOC were 1.67 and 1.47, respectively. At an incremental cost of 54,072 pound over a lifetime horizon, the ICER was 32,465 pound per LY and 36,826 pound per QALY. Sensitivity analyses were generally consistent with the base case findings. Conclusions: With limited treatments in FLT3+AML, MIDO represents a clinically significant advance in the management of newly-diagnosed AML. Using a threshold of 50,000 pound per QALY for end-of-life treatment, MIDO was shown to be a cost-effective option for newly-diagnosed FLT3+AML.",Acute myeloid leukemia; Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Life years; Quality-adjusted life years; Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio

We conducted a meta-analysis of relevant randomized trials to further examine this issue. Design, setting, participants, & measurements This meta-analysis included 3886 patients with ESRD/ACKD from seven qualified randomized trials using folic acid therapy and with CVD reported as one of the end points. Results When pooling the seven trials, folic acid therapy reduced the risk of CVD by 15% (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.96; P = 0.009). A greater beneficial effect was observed among those trials with a treatment duration >24 months (RR, 0.84; 95% Cl, 0.72 to 0.98; P = 0.02), a decrease in Hcy level >20% (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.95; P = 0.007), and no or partial folic acid fortification (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.99; P = 0.04). The beneficial effect also was seen when Hcy levels decreased >20%, even in the presence of folic acid fortification (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.99; P = 0.04). In the corresponding comparison groups, the estimated RRs were attenuated and insignificant. Conclusions Folic acid therapy can reduce CVD risk in patients with ESRD/ACKD by 15%.

755,excluded,Why does nitrogen addition to forest soils inhibit decomposition?,"Enrichment of forest soils with inorganic nitrogen (N) tends to inhibit oxidative enzyme expression by microbes and reduces plant litter and soil organic matter decomposition rates. Without further explanation than is currently presented in the scientific literature, we argue that upregulation of oxidative enzymes seems a more competitive response to prolonged N enrichment at high rates than the observed downregulation. Thus, as it stands, observed responses are inconsistent with predicted responses. In this article, we present a hypothesis that resolves this conflict. We suggest that high rates of N addition alter the competitive balance between enzymatic lignin mineralisation and non-enzymatic lignin oxidation. Using metatransciptomics and chemical assays to examine boreal forest soils, we found that N addition suppressed peroxidase activity, but not iron reduction activity (involved in non-enzymatic lignin oxidation).

756,excluded,Conservation Agriculture Practices Increase Potentially Mineralizable Nitrogen: A Meta-Analysis,"Potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN) is considered an important indicator of soil health. Cropping systems management can affect PMN. However, the effect size and relationship with crop yield across specific management practices remain uncertain. We conducted a quantitative review to understand how conservation agriculture management practices affect PMN including N fertilizer application, cropping system diversity, and tillage system as well as the relationship of crop yield with PMN. Data were extracted from 43 studies published in peer-reviewed journals, providing 494 paired comparisons of PMN and 26 paired comparisons of PMN and yield across selected crop management practices. In our meta-analysis, the effect size for each management practice was expressed as a response ratio, calculated as PMN or yield for the fertilizer application, high crop diversity, and no-till system to the no-fertilizer, less diverse crop system, and tillage system. On average, N-fertilized cropping systems had greater PMN; compared with no N fertilizer, inorganic N fertilizer had 22%, and manure had 34% higher PMN. Diverse cropping systems also had greater PMN; three or more different crops in rotation had 44% greater PMN than continuous cropping systems; cropping systems with a leguminous cover crop had 211%, greater PMN than systems without cover crops. Compared with till systems, no-till systems had 13% higher PMN. Overall, conservation practices consistently increased both PMN and yield; however, the increase in PMN and yield were not correlated. Consistent with the use of PMN as a soil health indicator, this synthesis demonstrates that practices benefiting PMN also benefit yield.",
757,excluded,Review of allometric equations for major land covers in SE Asia: Uncertainty and implications for above- and below-ground carbon estimates,"Our review of biomass studies conducted for 11 Southeast Asian countries, Papua New Guinea, and southern China uncovered 402 above-ground and 138 below-ground biomass allometric equations for the following major land covers: forest, peat swamp forest, mangrove forest, logged over forest, orchard and tree plantation, rubber plantation, oil palm plantation, bamboo, swidden fallow, and grassland/pasture/shrub land. No equations existed for non-swidden agroforest and permanent croplands, two other important land covers involved in current and projected land-cover transitions. We also found 245 stem-volume equations and 50 height-diameter equations. Applying existing allometric equations out of convenience is potentially a key source of uncertainty in above- and below-ground carbon stock estimates in many SE Asian landscapes. Differences in environmental conditions and vegetation characteristics should preclude the use of many pre-existing equations at locations outside of the geographical location where they were developed, without first verifying their applicability. While use of site-specific equations is preferred to reduce uncertainty in estimates, there are few in existence for many land covers and many geographical areas of the region. For example, few or no equations exist for Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, and Timor Leste. Ten or fewer above-ground biomass equations exist for rubber plantation, oil palm plantation, non-swidden agroforest, grassland/pasture/shrublands, and permanent croplands for the entire region. Even site-specific equations can introduce uncertainties to biomass estimates if they were determined from an insufficient sample size. Difficulties associated with sampling below-ground root biomass accurately often leads to allometric equations that potentially under-estimate below-ground biomass. In addition, substantial errors may be present if these below-ground equations are conveniently used by researchers in lieu of site-specific measurements. Although the importance of including wood density in allometry is increasingly recognized, only 26 of the reviewed studies did so. Ideally, when wood density values are used to estimate biomass, new on-site measurements should be taken, rather than relying on pre-existing values. This review demonstrates that more research in SE Asia is needed on biomass in general, specifically for several land covers including peat swamp forest, rubber and oil palm plantations, bamboo, swidden fallow, non-swidden agroforest, and permanent cropland. Importantly, for the purpose of informing the development and implementation of policies and programs such as REDD+, our meta-analysis highlights the pressing need to address the insufficient number of allometric equations and the possible inappropriate use of some when estimating vegetation biomass related to current and potential land cover changes in the region.

758,included,Enhanced top soil carbon stocks under organic farming,"It has been suggested that conversion to organic farming contributes to soil carbon sequestration, but until now a comprehensive quantitative assessment has been lacking. Therefore, datasets from 74 studies from pairwise comparisons of organic vs. nonorganic farming systems were subjected to metaanalysis to identify differences in soil organic carbon (SOC). We found significant differences and higher values for organically farmed soils of 0.18 +/- 0.06% points (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) for SOC concentrations, 3.50 +/- 1.08 Mg C ha(-1) for stocks, and 0.45 +/- 0.21 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) for sequestration rates compared with nonorganic management. Metaregression did not deliver clear results on drivers, but differences in external C inputs and crop rotations seemed important. Restricting the analysis to zero net input organic systems and retaining only the datasets with highest data quality (measured soil bulk densities and external C and N inputs), the mean difference in SOC stocks between the farming systems was still significant (1.98 +/- 1.50 Mg C ha-1), whereas the difference in sequestration rates became insignificant (0.07 +/- 0.08 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1)). Analyzing zero net input systems for all data without this quality requirement revealed significant, positive differences in SOC concentrations and stocks (0.13 +/- 0.09% points and 2.16 +/- 1.65 Mg C ha(-1), respectively) and insignificant differences for sequestration rates (0.27 +/- 0.37 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1)). The data mainly cover top soil and temperate zones, whereas only few data from tropical regions and subsoil horizons exist.

759,excluded,"Comparative metagenomic, phylogenetic and physiological analyses of soil microbial communities across nitrogen gradients","Terrestrial ecosystems are receiving elevated inputs of nitrogen (N) from anthropogenic sources and understanding how these increases in N availability affect soil microbial communities is critical for predicting the associated effects on belowground ecosystems. We used a suite of approaches to analyze the structure and functional characteristics of soil microbial communities from replicated plots in two long-term N fertilization experiments located in contrasting systems. Pyrosequencing-based analyses of 16S rRNA genes revealed no significant effects of N fertilization on bacterial diversity, but significant effects on community composition at both sites; copiotrophic taxa (including members of the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla) typically increased in relative abundance in the high N plots, with oligotrophic taxa (mainly Acidobacteria) exhibiting the opposite pattern. Consistent with the phylogenetic shifts under N fertilization, shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed increases in the relative abundances of genes associated with DNA/RNA replication, electron transport and protein metabolism, increases that could be resolved even with the shallow shotgun metagenomic sequencing conducted here (average of 75 000 reads per sample). We also observed shifts in the catabolic capabilities of the communities across the N gradients that were significantly correlated with the phylogenetic and metagenomic responses, indicating possible linkages between the structure and functioning of soil microbial communities. Overall, our results suggest that N fertilization may, directly or indirectly, induce a shift in the predominant microbial life-history strategies, favoring a more active, copiotrophic microbial community, a pattern that parallels the often observed replacement of K-selected with r-selected plant species with elevated N.

760,excluded,Carbon Sequestration by Perennial Energy Crops: Is the Jury Still Out?,"A promising option to sequester carbon in agricultural soils is the inclusion of cover crops in cropping systems. The advantage of cover crops as compared to other management practices that increase soil organic carbon (SOC) is that they neither cause a decline in yields, like extensification, nor carbon losses in other systems, like organic manure applications may do. However, the effect of cover crop green manuring on SOC stocks is widely overlooked. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to derive a carbon response function describing SOC stock changes as a function of time. Data from 139 plots at 37 different sites were compiled. In total, the cover crop treatments had a significantly higher SOC stock than the reference croplands. The time since introduction of cover crops in crop rotations was linearly correlated with SOC stock change (R-2 = 0.19) with an annual change rate of 0.32 +/- 0.08 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) in a mean soil depth of 22 cm and during the observed period of up to 54 years. Elevation above sea level of the plot and sampling depth could be used as explanatory variables to improve the model fit. Assuming that the observed linear SOC accumulation would not proceed indefinitely, we modeled the average SOC stock change with the carbon turnover model RothC. The predicted new steady state was reached after 155 years of cover crop cultivation with a total mean SOC stock accumulation of 16.7 +/- 1.5 Mg ha(-1) for a soil depth of 22 cm. Thus, the C input driven SOC sequestration with the introduction of cover crops proved to be highly efficient. We estimated a potential global SOC sequestration of 0.12 +/- 0.03 Pg Cyr(-1), which would compensate for 8% of the direct annual greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. However, altered N2O emissions and albedo due to cover crop cultivation have not been taken into account here. Data on those processes, which are most likely species-specific, would be needed for reliable greenhouse gas budgets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Although substantial manipulative experiments have been conducted to probe the responses of ecosystem C processes to altered precipitation, how soil C storage responds to both drought and irrigation is still unclear across biomes and the globe. A meta-analysis of 179 published studies was carried out to examine responses of soil C storage and associated C fluxes and pools to drought and irrigation. Our results showed that, on average across all biomes, drought and irrigation similarly induced minor increases in soil C pool (SCP) by 1.45% and 1.27%, respectively. However, drought and irrigation oppositely affected both C fluxes and plant C pools as well as in agroecosystems (e.g., croplands and grasslands). The drought-induced increases in root: shoot ratio and decreases in heterotrophic respiration and soil C turnover rate mostly contributed to minor increase in SCP, while an increase in newly fixed C inputs in soil was more important under irrigation. In addition, the relative changes in precipitation intensity in manipulative experiments were positively correlated with response ratios of plant C pool (PCP), net primary production (NPP), microbial biomass C, ecosystem, soil and heterotrophic respiration. The drought-induced responses of SCP exhibited a positive correlation with experimental duration but not under irrigation and for other C pools and fluxes. These results indicate that more attention should be paid to the responses of C allocation and turnover rate to drought and irrigation, which should be incorporated into land surface models to better project effects of altered precipitation on ecosystem C cycling in terrestrial ecosystems.

762,excluded,Effectiveness of ambulatory telemedicine care in older adults: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND Disparities in healthcare access and delivery, caused by transportation and health workforce difficulties, negatively impact individuals living in rural areas. These challenges are especially prominent in older adults. DESIGN We systematically evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness in providing telemedicine (TMed), searching the English-language literature for studies (January 2012 to July 2018) in the following databases: Medline (PubMed); Cochrane Library (Wiley); Web of Science; CINAHL; EMBASE (Ovid); and PsycINFO (EBSCO). PARTICIPANTS Older adults (mean age = 65 years or older, and none were younger than 60 years). INTERVENTIONS Interventions consisted of live, synchronous, two-way videoconferencing communication in nonhospital settings. All medical interventions were included. MEASUREMENTS Quality assessment, using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk-of-Bias Tool, was applied on all included articles, including a qualitative summary of all articles. RESULTS Of 6616 citations, we reviewed the full text of 1173 articles, excluding 1047 that did not meet criteria. Of the 17 randomized controlled trials, the United States was the country with the most trials (6 [35%]), with cohort sizes ranging from 3 to 844 (median = 35) participants. Risk of bias among included studies varied from low to high. Our qualitative analysis suggests that TMed can improve health outcomes in older adults and that it could be used in this population. CONCLUSIONS TMed is feasible and acceptable in delivering care to older adults. Research should focus on well-designed randomized trials to overcome the high degree of bias observed in our synthesis. Clinicians should consider using TMed in routine practice to overcome barriers of distance and access to care. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:1737-1749, 2019",effectiveness; older adult; rural; telemedicine
763,excluded,Matched or nonmatched interventions based on the transtheoretical model to promote physical activity. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine whether the efficacy of transtheoretical model (TTM)-based interventions on physical activity (PA) varied according to the following criteria: (1) interventions targeted the actual stages of change (SOCs) or did not; (2) participants were selected according to their SOC or were not; and (3) its theoretical constructs (decisional balance, temptation, self-efficacy, processes of change). Methods: Thirty-three randomized controlled trials assessing TTM-based interventions promoting PA in adults were systematically identified. Results: The between-group heterogeneity statistic (Qb) did not reveal any differential efficacy either in interventions targeting the actual SOC compared with those that did not (Qb = 1.48, p = 0.22) or in interventions selecting participants according to their SOC compared with those that did not (Qb = 0.01, p = 0.91). TTM-based interventions enhanced PA behavior whether they targeted the actual SOC (Cohen's d = 0.36; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.22-0.49) or not (d = 0.23; 95% CI: 0.09-0.38) and whether they selected their participants according to their SOC (d = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13-0.53) or not (d = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.19-0.44). The moderators of the efficacy of TTM-based interventions were the number of theoretical constructs used to tailor the intervention (Qb = 8.82, p = 0.003), the use of self-efficacy (Qb = 6.09, p = 0.01), and the processes of change (Qb = 3.51, p = 0.06). Conclusion: TTM- based interventions significantly improved PA behavior, and their efficacy was not moderated by SOC but by the TTM theoretical constructs.

764,included,The effects of forest thinning on soil carbon stocks and dynamics: A meta-analysis,"Forest thinning is widely used in forest management activities and has complex effects on underground carbon processes. Although many case studies have been done, how forest thinning affects soil carbon stocks and dynamics remains unclear, especially at different recovery stage. Here, we synthesized the results from 53 peer reviewed publications and conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the general responses of 10 variables related to forest soil carbon stocks and dynamics to forest thinning management. Overall, we did not find remarkable effects of thinning on soil moisture, fine root biomass and soil carbon stocks (including soil total carbon, soil organic carbon and microbial biomass carbon). However, thinning resulted in a significant reduction in litterfall production (-23.7%), while significantly increasing soil temperature (+8.7%) and soil respiration (+29.4%) in general. In particular, the effect of forest thinning on soil respiration was significant in light (thinning intensity < 33%) to moderate (33-67% of thinning intensity) thinning. In the early stage of recovery (<= 2 yr after thinning), this effect was also significant. Thinning significantly increased soil respiration in both broadleaved (+35.6%) and mixed forests (+9.3%) but not in coniferous forest due to the difference of litterfall quality. These results provide a synthetic review of the effects of forest thinning on soil carbon stocks and dynamics and may help to improve forest management strategies.",Forest thinning; Meta-analysis; Soil carbon stocks; Soil respiration; Recovery stage

Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of digital SOCs (Spyglass (TM) DS). Methods: Sixty-seven digital SOC procedures performed between 2015 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The most frequent indications for examination were indeterminate biliary strictures (61.2%) and biliary stone disease (23.9%). In 25 patients (37.3), visual findings predicted malignancy with a sensitivity of 88.9%, a specificity of 97.6%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 96.0% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 92.9%. For histological analysis, forceps biopsies were performed in 29 patients (43.2%). Compared with visual findings, forceps biopsies yield a lower diagnostic efficacy in diagnosing malignancy (sensitivity 62.5%, specificity 90.0%, PPV 90.9%, NPV 60.0%). Therapeutic interventions were performed in 19 patients with a technical success rate of 89.4%. Adverse events were observed in 17 patients (25.4%). Of these, 11 patients (16.4%) suffered from severe adverse events (pancreatitis, cholangitis or major bleeding), which led to a prolonged hospital stay. Conclusion: Digital SOCs have excellent diagnostic and therapeutic efficacies, but are accompanied by high rates of adverse events; therefore, physicians should use digital SOCs in carefully selected cases.",Cholangioscopy; SpyGlass DS; adverse events; digital single-operator cholangioscopy; indeterminate biliary strictures; complex biliary stone disease
766,excluded,A meta-analysis of viewing time measures of sexual interest in children,"Due to unobtrusiveness and ease of implementation, viewing time (VT) measures of sexual interest in children have sparked increasing research interest in forensic contexts over the last two decades. The current study presents two meta-analyses of VT measures adapted to assess pedophilic interest to determine their discrimination between sexual offenders against children (SOC) and non-SOC groups as well as convergent validity (associations with other measures of sexual interest in children). On average, VT measures showed moderate discrimination between criterion groups (fixed-effect d = 0.60, 95 % CI [0.51, 0.68], N = 2705, k = 14) and significant convergent validity with self-reports, penile plethysmography, Implicit Association Tests, and offence behavioral measures ranging from r = .18 to r = .38. VT measures, however, provided better discrimination for adults (fixed-effect d = 0.78, 95 % CI [0.64, 0.92]) than adolescent samples (fixed-effect d = 0.50, 95 % CI [0.40, 0.61]), Q (between) = 9.37, p = .002. Moreover, compared to absolute scores, using pedophilic difference scores within adult samples substantially increased VT measures' validity (fixed-effect d = 1.03, 95 % CI [0.82, 1.25], N = 414, k = 7). Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and applied implications for forensic contexts.",Sexual interest in children; Pedophilia; Meta-analysis; Implicit Association Test
767,included,Effects of forest management on soil c and n storage: meta analysis,"The effects of forest management on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are important to understand not only because these are often master variables determining soil fertility but also because of the role of soils as a source or sink for C on a global scale. This paper reviews the literature on forest management effects on soil C and N and reports the results of a meta analysis of these data. The meta analysis showed that forest harvesting, on average, had little or no effect on soil C and N. Significant effects of harvest type and species were noted, with sawlog harvesting causing increases (+18%) in soil C and N and whole-tree harvesting causing decreases (-6%). The positive effect of sawlog harvesting appeared to be restricted to coniferous species. Fire resulted in no significant overall effects of fire on either C or N (when categories were combined); but there was a significant effect of time since fire, with an increase in both soil C and N after 10 years (compared to controls). Significant differences among fire treatments were found, with the counterintuitive result of lower soil C following prescribed fire and higher soil C following wildfire. The latter is attributed to the sequestration of charcoal and recalcitrant, hydrophobic organic matter and to the effects of naturally invading, post-fire, N-fixing vegetation. Both fertilizer application and N-fixing vegetation caused marked overall increases in soil C and N.",Harvesting; Fire; Fertilization; Nitrogen fixation; Soil carbon; Soil nitrogen; Meta analysis
768,excluded,Responses of wheat to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi: A meta-analysis of field studies from 1975 to 2013,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can benefit growth and yield of agriculturally significant crops by increasing mineral nutrient uptake, disease resistance and drought tolerance of plants. We conducted a meta-analysis of 38 published field trials with 333 observations to determine the effects of inoculation and root colonization by inoculated and non-inoculated (resident) AMF on P, N and Zn uptake, growth and grain yield of wheat. Field AMF inoculation increased aboveground biomass, grain yield, harvest index, aboveground biomass P concentration and content, straw P content, aboveground biomass N concentration and content, grain N content and grain Zn concentration. Grain yield was positively correlated with root AMF colonization rate, whereas straw biomass was negatively correlated. The most important drivers of wheat growth response to AMF were organic matter concentration, pH, total N and available P concentration, and texture of soil, as well as climate and the AMF species inoculated. Analysis showed that AMF inoculation of wheat in field conditions can be an effective agronomic practice, although its economic profitability should still be addressed for large-scale applications in sustainable cropping systems.

769,excluded,Carbon sequestration in riparian forests: A global synthesis and meta-analysis,"Restoration of deforested and degraded landscapes is a globally recognized strategy to sequester carbon, improve ecological integrity, conserve biodiversity, and provide additional benefits to human health and well-being. Investment in riparian forest restoration has received relatively little attention, in part due to their relatively small spatial extent. Yet, riparian forest restoration may be a particularly valuable strategy because riparian forests have the potential for rapid carbon sequestration, are hotspots of biodiversity, and provide numerous valuable ecosystem services. To inform this strategy, we conducted a global synthesis and meta-analysis to identify general patterns of carbon stock accumulation in riparian forests. We compiled riparian biomass and soil carbon stock data from 117 publications, reports, and unpublished data sets. We then modeled the change in carbon stock as a function of vegetation age, considering effects of climate and whether or not the riparian forest had been actively planted. On average, our models predicted that the establishment of riparian forest will more than triple the baseline, unforested soil carbon stock, and that riparian forests hold on average 68-158 Mg C/ha in biomass at maturity, with the highest values in relatively warm and wet climates. We also found that actively planting riparian forest substantially jump-starts the biomass carbon accumulation, with initial growth rates more than double those of naturally regenerating riparian forest. Our results demonstrate that carbon sequestration should be considered a strong co-benefit of riparian restoration, and that increasing the pace and scale of riparian forest restoration may be a valuable investment providing both immediate carbon sequestration value and long-term ecosystem service returns.",carbon accounting; carbon credits; climate change; floodplain; multiple benefits; payment for ecosystem services; riparian restoration
770,excluded,Cost-effectiveness of ldl-c lowering with evolocumab in patients with high cardiovascular risk in the united states,"Randomized trials have shown marked reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), when evolocumab is administered. We hypothesized that evolocumab added to standard of care (SOC) vs SOC alone is cost-effective in the treatment of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) with or without statin intolerance and LDL-C >100mg/dL. Using a Markov cohort state transition model, primary and recurrent CVD event rates were predicted considering population-specific trial-based mean risk factors and calibrated against observed rates in the real world. The LDL-C-lowering effect from population-specific phase 3 randomized studies for evolocumab was used together with estimated LDL-C-lowering effect on CVD event rates per 38.67mg/dL LDL-C lowering from a statin-trial meta-analysis. Costs and utilities were included from published sources. Evolocumab treatment was associated with both increased cost and improved quality-adjusted lifeyears (QALY): HeFH (incremental cost: US$153 289, incremental QALY: 2.02, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: US$75 863/QALY); ASCVD (US$158 307, 1.12, US$141 699/QALY); and ASCVD with statin intolerance (US$136 903, 1.36, US$100 309/QALY). Evolocumab met both the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and World Health Organization (WHO) thresholds in each population evaluated. Sensitivity and scenario analyses confirmed that model results were robust to changes in model parameters. Among patients with HeFH and ASCVD with or without statin intolerance, evolocumab added to SOC may provide a cost-effective treatment option for lowering LDL-C using ACC/AHA intermediate/high value and WHO cost-effectiveness thresholds. More definitive information on the clinical and economic value of evolocumab will be available from the forthcoming CVD outcomes study.",

Data Sources Eligible studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, CINAHL, Academic Search Elite, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, SOC INDEX, and PsycINFO. Study Selection Studies were included if they were conducted in a developed country, published between the years 2004 and 2008, included a concurrent control group, and reported frequency data on breastfeeding initiation or duration. The suitability of design and quality of execution were evaluated using the Centers for Disease Control procedure for systematic reviews. Twenty-one articles met the criteria for inclusion. Data Extraction Study design, demographics, intervention/control conditions, settings, sampling strategies, potential threats to validity, and breastfeeding outcomes were abstracted and entered into a database for analysis and synthesis. Data Synthesis Odds ratios were calculated for each individual study, and studies were stratified into 2 groups by intervention delivery type. The pooled results indicated that studies using e-based interventions had a moderate effect on breastfeeding (odds ratio=2.2 [1.9-2.7], d=0.5); whereas provider-based interventions had very little to no effect (odds ratio=1.1 [1.0-1.2], d=0.03).

772,excluded,"Recommending or rejecting ""the dimple"": wpath-affiliated medical professionals' experiences and attitudes toward gender-confirming vulvoplasty in transgender women","Introduction: Rising numbers of trans women are undergoing genital surgeries, such as vulvoplasty or vulvovaginoplasty, to create a neovagina. Medical professionals who adhere to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care, Version 7, and who recommend or perform these procedures, are expected to balance best practices with patient preferences, specifically the decision to create or omit the vaginal canal. Due to a paucity of literature on gender-confirming vulvoplasty (GCV) in trans women, there has been no documentation of factors that prompt practitioners to reject or recommend the procedure. Aim: The aim of the study was to provide descriptive data of WPATH-affiliated medical professionals' knowledge, experiences, and attitudes toward GCV; surgical risks, benefits, and any considerations when referring transgender women 18-21 years of age for this procedure. Methods: Purposive sampling of all physicians, surgeons, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and registered nurses listed in the WPATH membership directory was initiated via invitational e-mails. The 32-item survey focused on demographics, medical practices, surgical techniques, and reasons for recommending or rejecting the procedure. Data analysis included frequencies and Pearson's chi(2) test. Main Outcome Measures: Key outcome measures included frequency of cases performed; reasons for recommending, rejecting, or performing GCV; and differences in attitudes toward the procedure among various medical professionals. Results: N = 198 (20.7%) of 956 solicited professionals completed the survey. Surgeons (n = 61) comprised 30.8% of the total sample. 46 surgeons (76.7%) reported having performed vulvovaginoplasty, and 25 (41.7%) had performed GCV. ""Patient request"" was the most common reason for recommending or performing GCV. Surgeons were more likely to either agree and perform (30.4%), or reject (32.1%) GCV in a patient aged 18-21 than other practitioners, who were more likely to be ""unsure"" (68.5%). These differences were statistically significant (chi(2) = 16.467 [2]; n = 193; P < .001). Clinical Implications: The data identify a lack of standardized terminology and surgical techniques concerning GCV. Strength & Limitations: This is the first exploratory study to assess medical practitioner experiences and attitudes toward a seldom documented procedure. A larger, more inclusive sample would increase the statistical strength and representative aspect of the study. Conclusion: The study shows divergence in attitudes and knowledge among medical practitioners who recommend or perform GCV, and uncertainty when the patient is 18-21 years old.

773,excluded,"Interactive effects of subsidiary crops and weed pressure in the transition period to non-inversion tillage, a case study of six sites across northern and central europe","Reducing soil tillage can lead to many benefits, but this practice often increases weed abundance and thus the need for herbicides, especially during the transition phase from inversion tillage to non-inversion tillage. We evaluated if subsidiary crops (SCs, e.g., cover crops) can mitigate the effects of non-inversion tillage on weed abundance. Two-year experiments studying SC use, tillage intensity, and nitrogen (N) fertilization level were carried out twice at six sites throughout northern and central Europe. SCs significantly reduced weed cover throughout the intercrop period (-55% to -1% depending on site), but only slightly during the main crops. Overall weed abundance and weed biomass were higher when using non-inversion tillage with SCs compared to inversion tillage without SCs. The effects differed due to site-specific weed pressure and management. With increasing weed pressure, the effect of SCs decreased, and the advantage of inversion over non-inversion tillage increased. N fertilization level did not affect weed abundance. The results suggest that SCs can contribute by controlling weeds but cannot fully compensate for reduced weed control of non-inversion tillage in the transition phase. Using non-inversion tillage together with SCs is primarily recommended in low weed pressure environments.",N fertilization; cover crops; living mulches; catch crops; non-inversion tillage; conservation agriculture; meta-analysis; weed management; integrated weed management; IPM
774,excluded,Association of informal caregiver distress with health outcomes of community-dwelling dementia care recipients: a systematic review,"BackgroundMost dementia care occurs in the community with support from informal caregivers who are often distressed. Dementia caregiver distress is known to be hazardous to the caregiver's health, but the impact on the dementia care recipient is not well known. MethodsWe searched the Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases from inception until June 2017 for studies investigating the association of informal caregiver distress with health outcomes of community-dwelling dementia care recipients. The search results were screened and then data abstracted, and the risk of bias was appraised independently by pairs of reviewers. ResultsWe included 81 original investigations (n = 43 761 caregivers and dementia care recipients). Sixty-six studies (81.5%) were observational or cross-sectional in design, and 47 studies (58%) had a low risk of bias. There was considerable clinical and methodological heterogeneity precluding quantitative synthesis. Dementia care recipients (n = 21 881) had a mean age of 78.2 years (SD 3.8 y), half (50.0%) were women, and two-thirds (66.1%) had Alzheimer's disease. The dementia caregivers (n = 21 880) had a mean age of 62.5 years (SD +/- 23.3), three-quarters (74.1%) were women, and one-half (50.5%) were spouses of the dementia care recipient. Twenty-two unique dementia care recipient outcomes were studied including cognition, mood, quality of life, function, healthcare utilization, and costs. Overall, informal caregiver distress is commonly associated with the institutionalization of the dementia care recipient, worsening behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and experiencing elder abuse. ConclusionInformal caregiving is a cornerstone of dementia care, and distress related to this role is associated with worsening of several dementia care recipient health outcomes. It is important that clinicians and researchers worldwide consider the broader consequences of caregiver distress.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of adding a PI3K inhibitor to the standard of care (SOC) treatment in ABC. The electronic databases Ovid, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Embase, were searched for relevant randomised trials. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for progression-free survival (PFS) and pooled risk ratios (RRs) for objective response rates (ORRs), disease control rates (DCRs) and toxicity were meta-analysed using the Mantele-Haenszel method and generic inverse variance. Five studies were included. In unselected patients, the addition of a PI3K inhibitor decreased the risk of progression by 21% (2329 participants, HR = 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 -0.88). A marginal improvement in ORR (2329 participants, RR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01 -1.57) and no improvement in DCR (2146 participants, RR = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.94-1.18) were achieved with a significant increase in toxicity of any grade (2386 participants, RR Z 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.06) and of grade III and higher (2386 participants, RR = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.76-2.08). A PFS benefit was seen in patients with and without PI3K pathway activation assessed on tumour and only in patients with an activated PI3K pathway when it was assessed from the plasma using circulating tumour DNA (ct-DNA) analysis. The addition of a PI3K inhibitor decreases the risk of progression in unselected ABC patients and particularly in patients with an activated PI3K pathway detected on ct-DNA analysis. However, their significant dose-limiting toxicity is a limiting factor. Selective PI3K inhibitors are being tested to assess whether these better-tolerated agents have a role in ABC treatment.

Tc-99m-labeled nanocolloid human serum albumin (Nanocoll(A (R))) is the most commonly used radio-labeled colloid in Europe and remains the standard of care (SOC). It is used in conjunction with vital blue dyes (VBDs) which relies on simple lymphatic drainage for localization. Although the exact mechanism of Nanocoll SLN localization is unknown, there is general agreement that Nanocoll exhibits the optimal size distribution and radiolabeling properties of the commercially available radiolabel colloids. [Tc-99m]Tilmanocept is a novel radiopharmaceutical designed to address these deficiencies. Our aim was to compare [Tc-99m]Tilmanocept to Nanocoll for SLN mapping in breast cancer. Data from the Phase III clinical trials of [Tc-99m]Tilmanocept's concordance with VBD was compared to a meta-analysis of a review of the literature to identify a Tc-99m albumin colloid SOC. The primary endpoints were SLN localization rate and degree of localization. Six studies were used for a meta-analysis to identify the colloid-based SOC. Five studies (6,134 patients) were used to calculate the SOC localization rate of 95.91 % (CI 0.9428-0.9754) and three studies (1,380 patients) were used for the SOC SLN degree of localization of 1.6683 (CI 1.5136-1.8230). The lower bound of the confidence interval was used for comparison to Tilmanocept. Tilmanocept data included 148 patients, and pooled analysis revealed a 99.99 % (CI 0.9977-1.0000) localization rate and degree of localization of 2.16 (CI 1.964-2.3600).

777,excluded,How do developmental and accommodative hrm enhance employee engagement and commitment? The role of psychological contract and soc strategies,"In the context of the changing workforce, this study introduced two perspectives on HRM and distinguished universalistic developmental HRM from contingent accommodative HRM. We predicted two separate pathways for the effects on two employee outcomes: work engagement and affective commitment. We expected that developmental HRM would universally relate to employee outcomes by rebalancing the psychological contract between the employee and organization into a less transactional to a more relational contract. We also predicted that accommodative HRM would relate to outcomes only when fulfilling specific needs of employees, associated with their selecting, optimizing, and compensating strategies. Results of a multilevel study among 1058 employees in 17 healthcare units fully supported our expectations regarding the role of the psychological contract. Additionally, we found support for the expected roles of selection and compensation, but not for optimization strategy. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that HRM relates to employee outcomes through multiple pathways, which can be either universal or contingent.",
778,excluded,"Ecosystem services in biologically diversified versus conventional farming systems: benefits, externalities, and trade-offs","We hypothesize that biological diversification across ecological, spatial, and temporal scales maintains and regenerates the ecosystem services that provide critical inputs-such as maintenance of soil quality, nitrogen fixation, pollination, and pest control-to agriculture. Agrobiodiversity is sustained by diversified farming practices and it also supplies multiple ecosystem services to agriculture, thus reducing environmental externalities and the need for off-farm inputs. We reviewed the literature that compares biologically diversified farming systems with conventional farming systems, and we examined 12 ecosystem services: biodiversity; soil quality; nutrient management; water-holding capacity; control of weeds, diseases, and pests; pollination services; carbon sequestration; energy efficiency and reduction of warming potential; resistance and resilience to climate change; and crop productivity. We found that compared with conventional farming systems, diversified farming systems support substantially greater biodiversity, soil quality, carbon sequestration, and water-holding capacity in surface soils, energy-use efficiency, and resistance and resilience to climate change. Relative to conventional monocultures, diversified farming systems also enhance control of weeds, diseases, and arthropod pests and they increase pollination services; however, available evidence suggests that these practices may often be insufficient to control pests and diseases or provide sufficient pollination. Significantly less public funding has been applied to agroecological research and the improvement of diversified farming systems than to conventional systems. Despite this lack of support, diversified farming systems have only somewhat reduced mean crop productivity relative to conventional farming systems, but they produce far fewer environmental and social harms. We recommend that more research and crop breeding be conducted to improve diversified farming systems and reduce yield gaps when they occur. Because single diversified farming system practices, such as crop rotation, influence multiple ecosystem services, such research should be holistic and integrated across many components of the farming system. Detailed agroecological research especially is needed to develop crop- and region-specific approaches to control of weeds, diseases, and pests.",
779,included,Forest soil carbon is threatened by intensive biomass harvesting,"Forests play a key role in the carbon cycle as they store huge quantities of organic carbon, most of which is stored in soils, with a smaller part being held in vegetation. While the carbon storage capacity of forests is influenced by forestry, the long-term impacts of forest managers' decisions on soil organic carbon (SOC) remain unclear. Using a meta-analysis approach, we showed that conventional biomass harvests preserved the SOC of forests, unlike intensive harvests where logging residues were harvested to produce fuelwood. Conventional harvests caused a decrease in carbon storage in the forest floor, but when the whole soil profile was taken into account, we found that this loss in the forest floor was compensated by an accumulation of SOC in deeper soil layers. Conversely, we found that intensive harvests led to SOC losses in all layers of forest soils. We assessed the potential impact of intensive harvests on the carbon budget, focusing on managed European forests. Estimated carbon losses from forest soils suggested that intensive biomass harvests could constitute an important source of carbon transfer from forests to the atmosphere (142-497 Tg-C), partly neutralizing the role of a carbon sink played by forest soils.",*Biomass; Carbon/chemistry; Carbon Cycle/physiology; Carbon Sequestration/*physiology; Ecosystem; *Environmental Monitoring; Forestry/*methods; Forests; Soil/*chemistry; Trees/chemistry

We have considered organic matter addition, no-tillage, crop rotation and organic agriculture as ""promising practices""; no organic matter input, conventional tillage, monoculture and conventional farming were taken as the respective references or ""standard practice"" (baseline). Relative effects were analysed through indicator response ratio (RR) under each paired practice. For this we considered data of 30 long-term experiments collected from 13 case study sites in Europe and China as collated in the framework of the EU-China funded iSQAPER project. These were complemented with data from 42 long-term experiments across China and 402 observations of long-term trials published in the literature. Out of these, we only considered experiments covering at least five years. The results show that OM addition favourably affected all the indicators under consideration. The most favourable effect was reported on earthworm numbers, followed by yield, SOM content and soil aggregate stability. For pH, effects depended on soil type; OM input favourably affected the pH of acidic soils, whereas no clear trend was observed under NT. NT generally led to increased aggregate stability and greater SOM content in upper soil horizons. However, the magnitude of the relative effects varied, e.g. with soil texture. No-tillage practices enhanced earthworm populations, but not where herbicides or pesticides were applied to combat weeds and pests. Overall, in this review, yield slightly decreased under NT. Crop rotation had a positive effect on SOM content and yield; rotation with ley very positively influenced earthworms' numbers. Overall, crop rotation had little impact on soil pH and aggregate - stability depending on the type of intercrop; alternatively, rotation of arable crops only resulted in adverse effects. A clear positive trend was observed for earthworm abundance under organic agriculture. Further, organic agriculture generally resulted in increased aggregate stability and greater SOM content. Overall, no clear trend was found for pH; a decrease in yield was observed under organic agriculture in this review.",Agricultural management practices; Soil quality indicators; Response ratio; Long-term field experiments; Literature review
781,included,The Effect of Harvest on Forest Soil Carbon: A Meta-Analysis,"Forest soils represent a substantial portion of the terrestrial carbon (C) pool, and changes to soil C cycling are globally significant not only for C sequestration but also for sustaining forest productivity and ecosystem services. To quantify the effect of harvesting on soil C, we used meta-analysis to examine a database of 945 responses to harvesting collected from 112 publications from around the world. Harvesting reduced soil C, on average, by 11.2% with 95% CI [14.1%, 8.5%]. There was substantial variation between responses in different soil depths, with greatest losses occurring in the O horizon (30.2%). Much smaller but still significant losses (3.3%) occurred in top soil C pools (0-15 cm depth). In very deep soil (60-100+ cm), a significant loss of 17.7% of soil C in was observed after harvest. However, only 21 of the 945 total responses examined this depth, indicating a substantial need for more research in this area. The response of soil C to harvesting varies substantially between soil orders, with greater losses in Spodosol and Ultisol orders and less substantial losses in Alfisols and Andisols. Soil C takes several decades to recover following harvest, with Spodosol and Ultisol C recovering only after at least 75 years. The publications in this analysis were highly skewed toward surface sampling, with a maximum sampling depth of 36 cm, on average. Sampling deep soil represents one of the best opportunities to reduce uncertainty in the understanding of the response of soil C to forest harvest.",forest management; harvest; soil carbon; soil order; deep soil; meta-analysis
782,excluded,Do evergreen and deciduous trees have different effects on net n mineralization in soil?,"Evergreen and deciduous plants are widely expected to have different impacts on soil nitrogen (N) availability because of differences in leaf litter chemistry and ensuing effects on net N mineralization (N-min). We evaluated this hypothesis by compiling published data on net N-min rates beneath co-occurring stands of evergreen and deciduous trees. The compiled data included 35 sets of co-occurring stands in temperate and boreal forests. Evergreen and deciduous stands did not have consistently divergent effects on net N-min rates; net N-min beneath deciduous trees was higher when comparing natural stands (19 contrasts), but equivalent to evergreens in plantations (16 contrasts). We also compared net N-min rates beneath pairs of co-occurring genera. Most pairs of genera did not differ consistently, i.e., tree species from one genus had higher net N-min at some sites and lower net N-min at other sites. Moreover, several common deciduous genera (Acer, Betula, Populus) and deciduous Quercus spp. did not typically have higher net N-min rates than common evergreen genera (Pinus, Picea). There are several reasons why tree effects on net N-min are poorly predicted by leaf habit and phylogeny. For example, the amount of N mineralized from decomposing leaves might be less than the amount of N mineralized from organic matter pools that are less affected by leaf litter traits, such as dead roots and soil organic matter. Also, effects of plant traits and plant groups on net N-min probably depend on site-specific factors such as stand age and soil type.",
783,excluded,Dialect change in south-east norway and the role of attitude in diffusion,"A common claim in the literature is that the local dialects in South-East Norway are being leveled towards the dialect of the upper social classes in Oslo. A meta-analysis of previous studies on dialect change in this region demonstrates that this assertion is incorrect, and that linguistic features have diffused from the dialect of the lower social classes in Oslo. Attitude studies show that people in South-East Norway have strongly negative views on the upper Oslo speech community, and this can largely explain why they do not adopt new linguistic features from this community. Within Oslo, however, linguistic features diffuse from the upper classes down to the lower classes, and the overall picture that can be drawn from these diffusion patterns is that the lower-class dialect of Oslo is spreading its features outwards from the capital, at the same time as it is gradually disappearing as a distinct sociolect. Det er vanleg a hevda at dei lokale malfOra i SOraust-Noreg vert tiljamna talemalet i dei Ovre sosiale laga i Oslo. Ein metaanalyse av tidlegare sprakendringsundersOkingar i dette omradet syner at den pastanden ikkje er rett, og at maldrag i staden spreier seg fra talemalet i dei laegre sosiale laga i Oslo. HaldningsundersOkingar syner at folk i SOraust-Noreg tykkjer ille om dei fra dei Ovre sosiale laga i Oslo, og da kan det vera mykje av grunnen til at dei ikkje tek imot nye maldrag fra talemalet deira heller. Men innanfor Oslo spreier maldraga seg fra dei Ovre til dei laegre sosiale laga, og hovudbiletet fra desse observasjonane vert da at maldrag fra talemalet i dei laegre sosiale laga i Oslo spreier seg utetter SOraust-Noreg samstundes som det same talemalet noko om senn vert borte i hovudstaden.

784,excluded,Effects of artificial nitrogen addition and reduction in precipitation on soil co2 and ch4 effluxes and composition of the microbial biomass in a temperate forest,"To understand the effects of artificially increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) and decreased precipitation on the soil microbial community and soil CO2 and CH4 efflux, a two-factorial field experiment was carried out with the following treatments: (a) control, (b) N addition (+50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), (c) decreased precipitation (-30% of throughfall) and (d) combined N addition and decreased precipitation (+50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), -30% of throughfall). The N addition and decreased precipitation treatments had a positive effect on mean CO2 efflux (2.61 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) for control, 4.26 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) for N addition, 3.62 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) for reduction in precipitation) and mean rates of CH4 uptake (0.00088 mu mol CH4 m(-2) s(-1) for control, 0.00154 mu mol CH4 m(-2) s(-1) for N addition, 0.00151 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for reduction in precipitation) during the growing season. The combined N addition and reduction in precipitation also led to increased soil CO2 efflux and CH4 uptake, but the combined response was weaker than the response to single variable treatments (3.10 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and 0.00130 mu mol CH4 m(-2) s(-1) interaction), indicating antagonistic effects of the combined treatment. At the seasonal scale, changes in soil CO2 and CH4 efflux were complex, especially in the spring freezing and thawing period, during which pulses of CO2 efflux and CH4 uptake occurred. Decreased precipitation altered the composition of the bacterial community in the winter and growing seasons, and composition of the microbial community also showed a seasonal change. However, changes in microbial community structure under N addition, precipitation reduction and their interaction might be important factors leading to an increase or decrease in soil carbon efflux. Highlights How global changes (N addition and decreased precipitation) affect soil C flux. Seasonal effects of global changes on soil C flux were analysed quantitatively. Decreased precipitation and N-addition increased soil CO2 flux and decreased soil CH4 flux. Global changes regulate soil C flux by altering soil water, microbial and nutrient status.",antagonistic effects; CH4 uptake; seasonal timescales; soil carbon efflux; soil microbial community
785,excluded,The validity of implicit association test (iat) measures of sexual attraction to children: a meta-analysis,"The current study presents a quantitative review of the discriminative and convergent validity of Implicit Association Test (IAT) measures adapted to assess sexual interest in children. IAT measures were able to distinguish sex offenders against children (SOC) from non-SOC (M weighted d from random-effects = 0.63, 95 % CI [0.42-0.83], N = 707, k = 12). The largest group differences were found between SOC and non-offenders, followed by non-sex offenders and rapists. IAT measures using sex versus not sex (and similar attribute categories, such as sex vs. neutral) provided superior discrimination compared to IAT measures using sexy versus not sexy (and similar attribute categories, such as erotic vs. non-erotic). The IAT measures had a moderate relationship to self-report (r = .27, 95 % CI [.13-.40], N = 182), sexual offense history variables (r = .27, 95 % CI [.08-.43], N = 145), and viewing time (r = .30, 95 % CI [.16-.43], N = 180) measures of sexual interest in children. Although these IAT measures can discriminate between groups and show convergence with other measures of sexual interest, a better understanding of the construct validity of these tools is required before their use in the assessment, treatment, and supervision of sex offenders.",
786,excluded,Cost-effectiveness of boceprevir co-administration versus pegylated interferon-alpha 2b and ribavirin only for patients with hepatitis c genotype 1 in singapore,"Background: Patients infected with chronic HCV genotype 1 experience liver complications as the disease progresses. This study aims to project the long-term reduction of liver complications and cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies, including co-administrating boceprevir (BOC) with pegylated interferon-alpha 2b (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin compared with standard of care (SOC) of PEG-IFN and ribavirin only. Methods: A Markov model was created to estimate the expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with treatment strategies outlined in the BOC package insert in Singapore. Patient characteristics were from pivotal trials, the transition probabilities and QALYs were estimated from publications, and the pharmaceutical and health status costs were obtained from a public hospital in Singapore. The threshold of cost-effectiveness was chosen as 65,000 SGD for this study. Results: For treatment-naive patients, BOC is highly cost-effective compared with SOC (179 SGD/QALY) and cost-saving for patients who have failed prior treatment, due to higher QALYs from better sustained virological response (SVR) and lower costs from avoidance of complications. Sub-group analyses show that BOC is cost-effective for non-cirrhotic treatment-experienced patients and null responders. It out-performs SOC for treatment-naive non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients who have failed prior treatment. Even after adjusting for higher prevalence of favourable IL28B genotype in Asians, BOC is cost-effective compared with SOC. Only untreated cirrhotic patients showed inconclusive costeffectiveness for BOC. Conclusions: Compared with SOC, BOC prevents more HCV liver complications from HCV genotype 1, particularly in patients who have failed previous SOC. Improved SVR and shortened duration of treatment result in BOC being potentially cost-saving or cost-effective in an Asian population.",
787,excluded,Antonovsky's sense of coherence scale and the relation with health: a systematic review,"Study objective: The aim of this paper is to synthesise empirical findings on the salutogenic concept sense of coherence (SOC) and examine its capacity to explain health and its dimensions. Design: The study is descriptive and analytical with a systematic integration of the contemporary knowledge base on the salutogenic research published 1992-2003. The review includes 458 scientific publications and 13 doctoral theses. Setting: Worldwide, based on postgraduate scientific publications in eight authorised databases, doctoral theses, and available books. Main results: SOC is strongly related to perceived health, especially mental health. The stronger the SOC the better the perceived health in general, at least for those with an initial high SOC. This relation is manifested in study populations regardless of age, sex, ethnicity, nationality, and study design. SOC seems to have a main, moderating or mediating role in the explanation of health. Furthermore, the SOC seems to be able to predict health. SOC is an important contributor for the development and maintenance of people's health but does not alone explain the overall health. Conclusion: SOC seems to be a health promoting resource, which strengthens resilience and develops a positive subjective state of health. Salutogenesis is a valuable approach for health promotion and would be worth to implement in practice much more than to date.",
788,excluded,What predicts emotional response in men awaiting prostate biopsy?,"Background: Incidence of prostate cancer is increasing as opportunistic screening becomes widespread and life expectancy rises. Despite screening availability, research reveals conflicting results on medical outcomes, for example, disease specific mortality. However the gold standard in early diagnosis of potentially curable organ confined prostate cancer is transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic prostate biopsy (TRUS-BX). While focus has been given to medical sequalae there is a paucity of research on the psychological impact of biopsy. Awaiting biopsy may be inherently stressful but no studies to date, have assessed men's perception of stress and its impact on emotional response. This study, therefore, examines the role of stress and also personal resources namely, self-efficacy and sense of coherence in emotional adjustment in men awaiting a prostate biopsy. Methods: Men attending a Rapid Access Prostate Cancer Clinic for a transrectal prostate biopsy (N = 114) participated in the study. They completed self report questionnaires on perceived stress (PSS), generalised self-efficacy (GSES), and sense of coherence (SOC). Adjustment was measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS-B) which assesses tension, depression, anger, fatigue, confusion and vigour. Results: Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that the set of predictors accounted for 17%-34% of variance across six mood states and predicted 46% of total mood disturbance. Perceived stress explained variance on all domains (11%-26%) with high stress linked to poor functioning. Conclusion: Perceived stress was the strongest and most consistent predictor of emotional adjustment. This is an important finding as stress appraisal has not been examined previously in this context and suggests that stress management is an important target to enhance emotional wellbeing of men attending for a prostate biopsy.",Prostate biopsy; Stress; Self-efficacy; Sense of coherence; Emotional adjustment
789,excluded,Traditional chinese medicinal herbs for the treatment of idiopathic chronic fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome,"Background Chronic fatigue is increasingly common. Conventional medical care is limited in treating chronic fatigue, leading some patients to use traditional Chinese medicine therapies, including herbal medicine. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine herbal products in treating idiopathic chronic fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome. Search strategy The following databases were searched for terms related to traditional Chinese medicine, chronic fatigue, and clinical trials: CCDAN Controlled Trials Register (July 2009), MEDLINE (1966-2008), EMBASE (1980-2008), AMED (1985-2008), CINAHL (19822008), PSYCHINFO (1985-2008), CENTRAL (Issue 2 2008), the Chalmers Research Group PedCAM Database (2004), VIP Information (1989-2008), CNKI (1976-2008), OCLC Proceedings First (1992-2008), Conference Papers Index (1982-2008), and Dissertation Abstracts (1980-2008). Reference lists of included studies and review articles were examined and experts in the field were contacted for knowledge of additional studies. Selection criteria Selection criteria included published or unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of participants diagnosed with idiopathic chronic fatigue or chronic fatigue syndrome comparing traditional Chinese medicinal herbs with placebo, conventional standard of care (SOC), or no treatment/wait lists. The outcome of interest was fatigue. Data collection and analysis 13 databases were searched for RCTs investigating TCM herbal products for the treatment of chronic fatigue. Over 2400 references were located. Studies were screened and assessed for inclusion criteria by two authors. Main results No studies that met all inclusion criteria were identified. Authors' conclusions Although studies examining the use of TCM herbal products for chronic fatigue were located, methodologic limitations resulted in the exclusion of all studies. Of note, many of the studies labelled as RCTs and conducted in China did not utilize rigorous randomization procedures. Improvements in methodology in future studies is required for meaningful synthesis of data.",
790,excluded,Problems associated to kinetic fitting of incubation data,"Incubation is a classical laboratory experiment to gain information about the carbon turnover from soils under different treatments (e.g., temperatures, water content, nutrient supply), amendments (e.g. biochar, straw, compost), or from different locations (e.g. topsoil vs. subsoil). Classically, the measured data are represented as cumulated CO2 flux or as % total organic carbon (TOC) mineralized and from those data kinetic parameters are often derived using models of different complexity. Based on the conceptual idea that more than one C-pool exists, especially in soil mixtures, the simple single-pool model is more and more substituted by double-pool models to describe these data. Hereby, the model will be iteratively fitted to the data to obtain the pool sizes and rate constants of the pools (slow and fast). In the work presented, we show that the fitting of double-pool models will lead to different results in the pool sizes and kinetic parameters, depending on the fitting approach used. Secondly, general problems of over-fitting and the ill-posed problem are discussed, whereby it will be shown, that especially the estimation of the rate constant for the slow pool is highly uncertain. Based on these general findings and problems in the fitting procedure, fitting results reported in literature were analyzed. The meta analysis indicates that only a small number of reported fits are apparently not well fitted, whereas a non negligible percentage of reported fits were over-fitted or wrong parameters were reported. Finally, the paper provides guidelines for kinetic fitting and discusses possible fitting alternatives.",Incubation experiments; Carbon turnover; Kinetic modeling
791,included,Patterns and mechanisms of responses by soil microbial communities to nitrogen addition,"Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition is expected to increase substantially and continuously in the future. Soil N availability regulates microbial communities and the decomposition and formation of soil organic matter, which have great impacts on global carbon (C) cycling. We conducted a meta-analysis based on 454 N-addition experiments in order to synthesize the patterns and mechanisms of responses by soil microbial communities to N addition in various biomes (i.e., boreal forest, temperate forest, tropical/subtropical forest, grassland, and desert). Results showed that the effects of N addition on the total microbial biomass varied depending on biome types, methodologies (fumigation-extraction technique vs. total phospholipid fatty acid), and N-addition rates. Nitrogen addition consistently decreased the microbial C:N and fungi to bacteria ratio (F:B), but increased Gram positive bacteria to Gram negative bacteria ratio (GP:GN) among biome types and N-addition rates. Nitrogen addition increased soil N availability and thereby resulted in soil acidification. Regression technique and principal component analyses showed that the shifts in the F:B and GP:GN mainly resulted from enhanced N availability due to N addition rather than soil acidification. When the N addition rate is lower than 100 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) about ten times higher than of global normal rate, the positive response of microbial growth was found. Overall, these findings revised the previous notion that N addition inhibited the microbial growth. Microbial species shifts might accentuate or mitigate the effects of alterations in microbial biomass at the ecosystem level, highlighting the critical role of microbial community composition in soil ecosystem functions under N deposition scenarios.

792,excluded,Soil carbon isotopic composition and soil carbon content in an agroecosystem during six years of free air carbon dioxide enrichment (face),"The Free Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiment conducted at the Federal Agricultural Research Centre (FAL) in Braunschweig in an arable crop rotation (total duration six years) allowed us to trace carbon (C) input in the soil C pool, as the CO2, used in the experiment to increase the atmospheric CO2 concentration, was depleted in 13C. Accurate assessment of the C input by means of stable C isotope analysis requires detailed knowledge on the spatial distribution of both the C isotopic composition and the C content in the soil C. Assumed changes in these parameters were examined. CO2 enrichment treatment over a six year period resulted in a clear trend towards an increase of soil C content in the uppermost 10cm of soil. About 4.9% of the soil C present under ambient air conditions, and 10.7% present under elevated CO2 conditions were determined as new input. However, the results are not statistically significant yet.",
793,included,Greenhouse-gas emissions from soils increased by earthworms,"Earthworms play an essential part in determining the greenhouse-gas balance of soils worldwide, and their influence is expected to grow over the next decades. They are thought to stimulate carbon sequestration in soil aggregates, but also to increase emissions of the main greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Hence, it remains highly controversial whether earthworms predominantly affect soils to act as a net source or sink of greenhouse gases. Here, we provide a quantitative review of the overall effect of earthworms on the soil greenhouse-gas balance. Our results suggest that although earthworms are largely beneficial to soil fertility, they increase net soil greenhouse-gas emissions.",carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; decadal variation; earthworm; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide; soil aggregate; soil fertility
