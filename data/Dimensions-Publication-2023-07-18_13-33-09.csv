SOC dynamics is driven by numerous factors such as  land-use change, land management and climate change. The amount of additional carbon potentially stored in the soil is the subject of much debate in the scientific community. We present a global database compiling the results of 217 meta-analyses analyzing the effects of land management, land-use change and climate change on SOC.

Thousands of original studies have focused on these drivers of SOC change and are now compiled in a growing number of meta-analyses. To critically assess the research efforts in this domain, we retrieved and characterized 192 meta-analyses of SOC stocks or concentrations. These meta-analyses comprise more than 13,200 original studies conducted from 1910 to 2020 in 150 countries. First, we show that, despite a growing number of studies over time, the geographical coverage of studies is limited. For example, the effect of land management, land-use change, and climate change on SOC has been only occasionally studied in North and Central Africa, and in the Middle East and Central Asia. Second, the meta-analyses investigated a limited number of land management practices, mostly mineral fertilization, organic amendments, and tillage. Third, the meta-analyses demonstrated relatively low quality and transparency. Lastly, we discuss the mismatch between the increasing number of studies and the need for more local, reusable, and diversified knowledge on how to preserve high SOC stocks or restore depleted SOC stocks.",CONFLICT OF INTERESTS The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Global Change Biology,,,Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Soil,2021-12-07,2021,2021-12-07,2022-02,28,4,1690-1702,Closed,Article,"Beillouin, Damien; Cardinael, Rémi; Berre, David; Boyer, Annie; Corbeels, Marc; Fallot, Abigail; Feder, Frédéric; Demenois, Julien","Beillouin, Damien (CIRAD, UPR HortSys, Montpellier, France; HortSys, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France); Cardinael, Rémi (AIDA, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; CIRAD, UPR AIDA, Harare, Zimbabwe; Department of Plant Production Sciences and Technologies, University of Zimbabwe, Harare, Zimbabwe); Berre, David (AIDA, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; CIRAD, UPR AIDA, Bobo‐Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; CIRDES, USPAE, Bobo‐Dioulasso, Burkina Faso); Boyer, Annie (CIRAD, DGDRS, DIST, Montpellier, France); Corbeels, Marc (AIDA, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; IITA, International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Nairobi, Kenya); Fallot, Abigail (CIRAD, UMR SENS, Montpellier, France; SENS, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France); Feder, Frédéric (CIRAD, UPR Recyclage et Risque, Montpellier, France; Recyclage et Risque, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France); Demenois, Julien (AIDA, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; CIRAD, UPR AIDA, Montpellier, France)","Beillouin, Damien (Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement; University of Montpellier)","Beillouin, Damien (Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement; University of Montpellier); Cardinael, Rémi (University of Montpellier; University of Zimbabwe); Berre, David (University of Montpellier; Centre international de recherche-développement sur l'elevage en zone subhumide); Boyer, Annie (Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement); Corbeels, Marc (University of Montpellier; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture); Fallot, Abigail (Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement; University of Montpellier); Feder, Frédéric (Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement; University of Montpellier); Demenois, Julien (University of Montpellier; Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement)",48,48,5.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143658493,41 Environmental Sciences,15 Life on Land

Here, we conducted a thorough review of the impacts of land-use change, land management, and climate change on SOC. Using second-order meta-analysis, we synthesized findings from 230 first-order meta-analyses comprising over 25,000 primary studies. We show that (i) land conversion for crop production leads to high SOC loss, that can be partially restored through land management practices, particularly by introducing trees and incorporating exogenous carbon in the form of biochar or organic amendments, (ii) land management practices that are implemented in forests generally result in depletion of SOC, and (iii) indirect effects of climate change, such as through wildfires, have a greater impact on SOC than direct climate change effects (e.g., from rising temperatures). The findings of our study provide strong evidence to assist decision-makers in safeguarding SOC stocks and promoting land management practices for SOC restoration. Furthermore, they serve as a crucial research roadmap, identifying areas that require attention to fill the knowledge gaps concerning the factors driving changes in SOC.","Support for this study to M.C. was provided through the CGIAR initiative Mitigate + : Research for Low-Emission Food Systems, and through the contributions of all funders to the CGIAR Trust Fund.",,Nature Communications,,,Soil; Ecosystem; Carbon; Forests; Crop Production; Carbon Sequestration; Agriculture,2023-06-22,2023,2023-06-22,,14,1,3700,All OA; Gold,Article,"Beillouin, Damien; Corbeels, Marc; Demenois, Julien; Berre, David; Boyer, Annie; Fallot, Abigail; Feder, Frédéric; Cardinael, Rémi","Beillouin, Damien (CIRAD, UPR HortSys, Montpellier, France; HortSys, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France); Corbeels, Marc (AIDA, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; IITA, Nairobi, Kenya); Demenois, Julien (AIDA, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; CIRAD, UPR AIDA, Turrialba, Costa Rica; CATIE, Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza, Turrialba, Costa Rica); Berre, David (AIDA, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; CIRAD, UPR AIDA, Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; CIRDES, USPAE, Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso); Boyer, Annie (CIRAD, DGDRS, DIST, Montpellier, France); Fallot, Abigail (CIRAD, UMR SENS, Montpellier, France; SENS, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France); Feder, Frédéric (CIRAD, UPR Recyclage et Risque, Montpellier, France; Recyclage et Risque, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France); Cardinael, Rémi (AIDA, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; CIRAD, UPR AIDA, Harare, Zimbabwe; Department of Plant Production Sciences and Technologies, University of Zimbabwe, Harare, Zimbabwe)","Beillouin, Damien (Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement; University of Montpellier)","Beillouin, Damien (Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement; University of Montpellier); Corbeels, Marc (University of Montpellier; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture); Demenois, Julien (University of Montpellier; Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza Catie); Berre, David (University of Montpellier; Centre international de recherche-développement sur l'elevage en zone subhumide); Boyer, Annie (Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement); Fallot, Abigail (Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement; University of Montpellier); Feder, Frédéric (Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement; University of Montpellier); Cardinael, Rémi (University of Montpellier; University of Zimbabwe)",0,0,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39338-z.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160010483,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3007 Forestry Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management",13 Climate Action; 15 Life on Land

However, the effects of these practices differ due to diverse climatic scenario, soil characteristics and management system. To identify the suitable practices that can be effective under tropical and subtropical conditions, a systematic evaluation in the form of a meta-analysis of these practices and their outcomes was performed over those regions. In this work we have included 516 observations from 84 articles published from 2000 to 2021 to analyse the influence of three CSA practices (conservation tillage, cover crop and biochar application) on the SOC (soil organic carbon) stocks over varying periods of experimentation. In addition to this, the combined effect of CSA and other conservation agronomic practices such as agroforestry has also been considered in the analysis. The results showed that biochar application had the most influence upon SOC stocks in the agricultural lands (25.38%) followed by conservation tillage (18.81%) and cover crop (15.8%). Medium term experiments (6-20 years) of these conservation practices showed about 31.00-96.15%improvement in SOC while the effects gradually diminished in long term experiments (>20 years). The combinations of these practices have been observed to have an evidently positive impact upon the SOC stocks in general. This work provides a systematic evaluation of all the widely performed CSA and other conservation practices and their effects on SOC dynamics under differing management settings.","The authors acknowledge that this research is funded by the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) scheme (F.15-9(JULY 2016)/2016(NET)) of the University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi, India.",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Soil,2021-09-20,2021,2021-09-20,2022-01,805,,150428,Closed,Article,"Das, Sharmistha; Chatterjee, Soumendu; Rajbanshi, Joy","Das, Sharmistha (Department of Geography, Presidency University, Kolkata, India.); Chatterjee, Soumendu (Department of Geography, Presidency University, Kolkata, India.

However, spatially explicit insight on management impacts is limited, which is crucial for region-specific and climate-smart practices. To overcome these limitations, we combined global meta-analytical results on improved management practices on SOC sequestration with spatially explicit data on current management practices and potential areas for the adoption of these measures. We included (a) fertilization practices, i.e., use of organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer or no fertilizer, (b) soil tillage practices, i.e., no-tillage relative to high or intermediate intensity tillage, and (c) crop management practices, i.e., use of cover crops and enhanced crop residue incorporation. We show that the estimated global C sequestration potential varies between 0.44 and 0.68 Gt C yr-1 , assuming maximum complementarity among all measures taken. A more realistic estimate, not assuming maximum complementarity, is from 0.28 to 0.43 Gt C yr-1 , being on the lower end of the current range of 0.1-2 Gt C yr-1 found in the literature. One reason for the lower estimate is the limited availability of manure that has not yet been recycled. Another reason is the limited area for the adoption of improved measures, considering their current application and application limitations. We found large regional differences in carbon sequestration potential due to differences in yield gaps, SOC levels, and current practices applied. The highest potential is found in regions with low crop production, low initial SOC levels, and in regions where livestock manure and crop residues are only partially recycled. Supporting previous findings, we highlight that to encourage both soil fertility and SOC sequestration, it is best to focus on agricultural soils with large yield gaps and/or where SOC values are below levels that may limit crop production.",,,Global Change Biology,,,"Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Crops, Agricultural; Fertilizers; Soil",2021-11-12,2021,2021-11-12,2022-02,28,3,1162-1177,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Lessmann, Malte; Ros, Gerard H.; Young, Madaline D.; Vries, Wim","Lessmann, Malte (Land Use Planning Group, Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands); Ros, Gerard H.

However, a lack of biochar-induced changes of C, N and P acquisition enzyme activities hinders us from understanding if biochar application will lead to microbial C, N and P limitation based on ecoenzymatic stoichiometry. In this study, through ecoenzymatic stoichiometry, a meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate responses of microbial metabolic limitation to biochar amendment by collecting data of ecoenzymatic activities (EEAs) of the C, N and P acquisition from peer-reviewed papers. The results showed that biochar application increased activities of C, N acquisition enzymes significantly by 9.3 % and 15.1 % on average, respectively. But the influence on P acquisition enzymes activities (Acid, neutral or alkaline phosphatase, abbreviated wholly as PHOS) was not significant. Biochar increased ratio of C acquisition enzymes activities (EC) over P enzymes activities (EP) and ratio of N enzymes activities (EN) over EP, but decreased EC:EN, indicating an increased N limitation or a shift from P limitation to N limitation in microbial metabolism. Enzyme vector analysis showed that soil microbial metabolism was limited by C relative to nutrients (N and P) under biochar amendment according to the overall increased vector length (~1.5 %). Wood biochar caused the strongest microbial C limitation, followed by crop residue biochar as indicated by increased enzyme vector length of 3.6 % and 1.2 % on average, respectively. The stronger microbial C limitation was also found when initial soil total organic carbon (SOC) was <20 g·kg-1. Our results illustrated that available nitrogen and organic carbon should be provided to meet microbial stoichiometric requirements to improve plant productivity, especially in low fertile soils under biochar amendment.","We gratefully acknowledge support for this research from the Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no.

Yet, our ability to accurately detect and predict the impact of these global changes on SOC dynamics is still limited. Investigating SOC responses to global changes separately for mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) and the particulate organic carbon (POC) can aid in the understanding of overall SOC responses, because these are formed, protected, and lost through different pathways. To this end, we performed a systematic meta-analysis of the response of SOC, MAOC, and POC to global changes. POC was particularly responsive, confirming that it is a better diagnostic indicator of soil C changes in the short-term, compared to bulk SOC and MAOC. The effects of elevated CO2 and warming were subtle and evident only in the POC fraction (+5.11% and - 10.05%, respectively), while increased precipitation had no effects at all. Nitrogen fertilization, which comprised the majority of the dataset, increased SOC (+5.64%), MAOC (+4.49%), and POC (+13.17%). Effect size consistently varied with soil depth and experiment length, highlighting the importance of long-term experiments that sample the full soil profile in global change SOC studies. In addition, SOC pool responses to warming were modified by degree of warming, differently for air and soil warming manipulations. Overall, we suggest that MAOC and POC respond differently to global changes and moderators because of the different formation and loss processes that control these pools. Coupled with additional plant and microbial measurements, studying the individual responses of POC and MAOC improves understanding of the underlying dynamics of SOC responses to global change. This will help inform the role of SOC in mitigating the climate crisis.","We thank Shelby C. McClelland for her invaluable help with regard to meta-analytical methodology.

A systematic review,"Cover cropping is commonly acknowledged to promote soil health in agriculture. However, contradictory findings on the benefits of cover crops for soil health, crop productivity, economic and ecological factors, as well as the influence of inherent soil parameters on such benefits exist in the scientific literature. Here, we critically assessed evidence of cover crop benefits through a systematic review of the published literature. To access relevant papers, we searched the literature for cover crops and soil health indicators using Scopus (1996-2020), ScienceDirect (1996-2020) and Google scholar (1970-1996) with specific keywords and combinations. Only English research papers including experimental plots and control groups were considered. We analyzed 102 unique peer-reviewed papers and 1494 corresponding unique plots encompassing various cover crops, soil textures, climates, management systems and experimental duration (1-3 years, 4-6 years, 7-10 years and over 10 years). Strong evidence suggests that cover crops can enhance soil structure and promote soil health by improving soil physical and chemical properties, including saturated hydraulic conductivity (mean net change of 105.6 %), total organic carbon (10.1 %), and total nitrogen (20.2 %). On the other hand, cover crops exhibit weak effects on properties like bulk density and microporosity with fairly low values of net change. In most cases, cover crops increase the soil carbon content, including microbial biomass carbon (19.5 %) and particulate organic carbon (49.5 %). In this systematic review, we found limited studies on the effect of cover crops on soil health as influenced by soil texture, regional climate, rainfall and duration of the cover crop practices. The paucity of long-term regional systematic research of soil physics, chemistry and biology makes it difficult to forecast future implications of cover crops on soil health indicators.","MAN was partly supported by The University of California – Davis, Agricultural Experiment Station and the Multistate Hatch Program W4188 of the USDA, National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Simulated country-scale adoption of reduced tillage, cover cropping, and ley-arable integration using RothC","Adopting Regenerative Agriculture (RA) practices on temperate arable land can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration without reducing crop yields. RA is therefore receiving much attention as a climate change mitigation strategy. However, estimating the potential change in national soil carbon stocks following adoption of RA practices is required to determine its suitability for this. Here, we use a well-validated model of soil carbon turnover (RothC) to simulate adoption of three regenerative practices (cover cropping, reduced tillage intensity and incorporation of a grass-based ley phase into arable rotations) across arable land in Great Britain (GB). We develop a modelling framework which calibrates RothC using studies of these measures from a recent systematic review, estimating the proportional increase in carbon inputs to the soil compared to conventional practice, before simulating adoption across GB. We find that cover cropping would on average increase SOC stocks by 10 t·ha-1 within 30 years of adoption across GB, potentially sequestering 6.5 megatonnes of carbon dioxide per year (MtCO2·y-1). Ley-arable systems could increase SOC stocks by 3 or 16 t·ha-1, potentially providing 2.2 or 10.6 MtCO2·y-1 of sequestration over 30 years, depending on the length of the ley-phase (one and four years, respectively, in these scenarios). In contrast, our modelling approach finds little change in soil carbon stocks when practising reduced tillage intensity. Our results indicate that adopting RA practices could make a meaningful contribution to GB agriculture reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions despite practical constraints to their uptake.","We would like to thank Dr. Andrew C.

Due to the vulnerability and exposure of agriculture, farmers’ adaptive strategies to climate change are important to food security and sustainable environment development. However, a systematic review is still absent, though there are many studies about farmers’ adaptations to climate change, and few studies discuss their potential impacts on climate change. This article analyses farmers’ adaptation strategies and their heterogeneities across regions in China via a systemic literature review. Then we also discuss possible driving factors of these adaptations and their potential impacts on greenhouse gas emissions. We follow the updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines to identify and screen publications. A total of 448 relevant records were identified from the Web of Science, Elsevier ScienceDirect, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). We include peer-reviewed publications focusing on farmers engaged in crop farming in China, with survey data and specific adoption ratio analysis of adaptations to climate change. After screening, 27 articles were finally analysed. Our results show that crop variety management, rescheduling farming, increasing production inputs, increasing irrigation, and crop structure management are prevalent strategies reported in the existing literature. However, sustainable adaptations such as improving farmland’s ecological environment and agronomic water-saving irrigation gain less attention. Besides, farmers in northern China adapt to climate change more actively compared to their counterparts in southern China. Moreover, some adaptations with high adoption ratios, such as increased chemical inputs, might increase greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate climate change. Our findings have important implications for food security and sustainable agricultural development.",,"The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 71873067), the China–Europe Efficient Water Management Research Platform (no. 2017YFE0118100), “A project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)”, and the Graduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (no.

Previous studies have reported high rates of soil carbon sequestration in turfgrass, but no systematic review has summarized these rates nor evaluated how they change as turfgrass ages. Here we conducted a meta-analysis of soil carbon sequestration rates from 63 studies globally, comprised mostly of C3 grass species in the U.S., including 24 chronosequence studies that evaluated carbon changes over 75 years or longer. We showed that turfgrass established within the last ten years had a positive mean soil C sequestration rate of 5.3 Mg CO2 ha-1 yr-1 (95% CI = 3.7-6.2), which is higher than rates reported for several soil conservation practices. Areas converted to turfgrass from forests were an exception, sometimes lost soil carbon, and had a cross-study mean sequestration rate that did not differ from 0. In some locations, soil C accumulated linearly with turfgrass age over several decades, but the major trend was for soil C accumulation rates to decline through time, reaching a cross-study mean sequestration rate that was not different from 0 at 50 years. We show that fitting soil C timeseries with a mechanistically derived function rather than purely empirical functions did not alter these conclusions, nor did employing equivalent soil mass versus fixed-depth carbon stock accounting. We conducted a partial greenhouse gas budget that estimated emissions from mowing, N-fertilizer production, and soil N2O emissions. When N fertilizer was applied, average maintenance emissions offset 32% of C sequestration in recently established turfgrass. Potential emission removals by turfgrass can be maximized with reduced-input management. Management decisions that avoid losing accrued soil C-both when turfgrass is first established and when it is eventually replaced with other land-uses-will also help maximize turfgrass C sequestration potential.","We thank all the research teams who shared their data, as well as helpful feedback on the manuscript from T.

However, biogas slurry (BS), a liquid with a high moisture content and a low C/N ratio, differs from commercial organic fertilizer and manure in terms of its impact on the soil N cycle. Replacing CF with BS needs to be reconsidered regarding soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and crop production in terms of fertilization, agricultural land type, and soil characteristics. For this systematic review, the results of 92 published studies worldwide were collected. Based on the findings, the combined application of BS and CF can significantly increase soil total N (TN), microbial biomass N (MBN), and soil organic matter (SOM) levels. The Chaol and ACE index values of soil bacteria were increased by 13.58% and 18.53%, whereas those of soil fungi were decreased by 10.45% and 14.53%, respectively. At a replacement ratio (rr) ≤ 70%, crop yield was promoted by 2.20%-12.17%, and soil N2O emissions were reduced by 1.94%-21.81%. A small rr (≤30%) was more conducive to growth, and a moderate rr (30% < rr ≤ 70%) was more favorable for N2O emission reduction, especially in the dryland crop system. However, at rr = 100%, soil N2O emissions in neutral and alkaline dryland soil were increased by 28.56%-32.22%. The importance analysis of the influencing factors showed that the proportion of BS, the N application rate, and the temperature were the factors affecting soil N2O emissions. Our results provide a scientific basis for the safe use of BS in agricultural systems.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

There is no consensus of CCs under different climatic conditions on soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), soil microbial biomass nitrogen (SMBN), and soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen ratio (SMBC/SMBN) are yet documented. Thus, a global meta-analysis of 40 currently available literature was carried out to elucidate the effect of CCs on SMBC and SMBN, and its ratio for cash and cover cropping systems was conducted. Our findings demonstrated that CCs increased SMBC, SMBN, and SMBC/SMBN ratios by 39, 51, and 20%, respectively, as compared to NCCs. The categorical meta-analyzes showed that the mixture of legume and nonlegume CCs decreased the SMBC, SMBN, and SMBC/SMBN ratios relative to the sole legume or nonlegume CCs. Nonlegume CCs enhanced the SMBC, SMBN, and SMBC/SMBN ratio compared to legume CCs. When CCs residues were incorporated into the soil or surface mulched, the SMBC and SMBN increased compared to the removal of residues. The effect of CCs on the SMBN and SMBC/SMBN ratio was higher in medium-textured soils compared to coarser or fine-textured soils, but coarser-textured soils have a higher SMBC. The effect of CCs on SMBN and SMBC/SMBN ratio was prominent on medium-textured soils having soil organic carbon (SOC) in the range of 10–20 mg g−1, pH > 6.5, and total nitrogen (TN) in the range of 1–2%. It was concluded that CCs enhanced SMBC, SMBN, and its ratio compared to NCCs. The response, however, varied depending on the soil properties and climatic region. Cover crops can boost the biological soil’s health by increasing the microbial population’s abundance compared to NCCs.",,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Biomass; Carbon; Nitrogen; Soil; Soil Microbiology,2021-07-23,2021,2021-07-23,2021-12,28,45,64241-64252,Closed,Article,"Muhammad, Ihsan; Wang, Jun; Khan, Ahmad; Ahmad, Shakeel; Yang, Li; Ali, Izhar; Zeeshan, Muhammad; Ullah, Saif; Fahad, Shah; Ali, Shamsher; Zhou, Xun Bo","Muhammad, Ihsan (Guangxi Colleges and Universities Key Laboratory of Crop Cultivation and Tillage, Agricultural College, Guangxi University, 530004, Nanning, China); Wang, Jun (Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Earth Surface System and Environmental Carrying Capacity, College of Urban and Environmental Science, Northwest University, 710127, Xi’an, China); Khan, Ahmad (Department of Agronomy, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, Pakistan); Ahmad, Shakeel (Guangxi Colleges and Universities Key Laboratory of Crop Cultivation and Tillage, Agricultural College, Guangxi University, 530004, Nanning, China); Yang, Li (Guangxi Colleges and Universities Key Laboratory of Crop Cultivation and Tillage, Agricultural College, Guangxi University, 530004, Nanning, China); Ali, Izhar (Guangxi Colleges and Universities Key Laboratory of Crop Cultivation and Tillage, Agricultural College, Guangxi University, 530004, Nanning, China); Zeeshan, Muhammad (Guangxi Colleges and Universities Key Laboratory of Crop Cultivation and Tillage, Agricultural College, Guangxi University, 530004, Nanning, China); Ullah, Saif (Guangxi Colleges and Universities Key Laboratory of Crop Cultivation and Tillage, Agricultural College, Guangxi University, 530004, Nanning, China); Fahad, Shah (Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Earth Surface System and Environmental Carrying Capacity, College of Urban and Environmental Science, Northwest University, 710127, Xi’an, China); Ali, Shamsher (Department of Soil and Environmental Sciences, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, Pakistan); Zhou, Xun Bo (Guangxi Colleges and Universities Key Laboratory of Crop Cultivation and Tillage, Agricultural College, Guangxi University, 530004, Nanning, China)","Zhou, Xun Bo (Guangxi University)","Muhammad, Ihsan (Guangxi University); Wang, Jun (Northwest University); Khan, Ahmad (University of Agriculture); Ahmad, Shakeel (Guangxi University); Yang, Li (Guangxi University); Ali, Izhar (Guangxi University); Zeeshan, Muhammad (Guangxi University); Ullah, Saif (Guangxi University); Fahad, Shah (Northwest University); Ali, Shamsher (University of Agriculture); Zhou, Xun Bo (Guangxi University)",9,9,1.44,4.98,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139874251,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 3007 Forestry Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences",

To achieve the goal of limiting or mitigating these emissions, a rigorous abatement strategy with an additional focus on improving crop productivity is now imperative. Replacing traditional agriculture with soil conservation-based farming can have numerous ecological benefits. However, most assessments only consider improvements in soil properties and crop productivity, and often preclude the quantitative impact analysis on GHGs emissions. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate crop productivity (i.e., biomass, grain, total yield) and GHGs emissions (i.e., CO2, N2O, CH4) for three major soil conservation practices i.e., no-tillage, manures, and biochar. We also examined the yield potential of three major cereal crops (i.e., wheat, rice, maize) and their significance in mitigating GHGs emissions. None of the manures were able to reduce GHGs emissions, with poultry manure being the largest contributor to all GHGs emissions. However, pig-manure had the greatest impact on crop yield while emitting the least CO2 emissions. Use of biochar showed a strong coupling effect between reduction of GHGs (i.e., CH4 by -37%; N2O by -25%; CO2 by -5%) and the increase in crop productivity. In contrast, no-tillage resulted in higher GHGs emissions with only a marginal increase in grain yield. Depending on crop type, all cereal crops showed varied degrees of GHGs mitigation under biochar application, with wheat responding most strongly due to the additional yield increment. The addition of biochar significantly reduced CO2 and N2O emissions under both rainfed and irrigated conditions, although CH4 reductions were identical in both agroecosystems. Interestingly, the use of biochar resulted in a greater yield benefit in rainfed than in irrigated agriculture. Despite significant GHGs emissions, manure application contributed to higher crop yields, regardless of soil type or agroecosystem. Moreover, no-tillage showed a significant reduction in CH4 and N2O emissions under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Notably , biochar application in coarse while no-till in fine textured soils contributed to N2O mitigation. Most importantly, effectiveness of no-tillage as a countermeasure to GHGs emissions while providing yield benefits is inconsistent. Overall, the decision to use farm manures should be reconsidered due to higher GHGs emissions. We conclude that the use of biochar could be an ideal way to reduce GHGs emissions. However, further understanding of the underlying mechanisms and processes affecting GHGs emissions is needed to better understand the feedback effects in conservation agriculture.","Awais Shakoor would like to express his gratitude for the grant provided by the University of Lleida, Spain.

However, a systematic evaluation of the impact of drought on SSBs at a global scale has not yet been well understood. We evaluated the effects of drought on SSBs and identified the association key drivers in the current meta-analysis. The overall effects of drought on soil seed density and richness were weak negative and positive, respectively. Drought significantly increased soil seed density by 11.94 % in forest ecosystem, whereas soil seed richness were significantly increased in vascular plants (7.39 %). Linear mixed-effect results showed that soil seed density and richness significantly reduced as increasing drought intensity. In addition, geography (altitude) has significance in controlling the lnRR of soil seed density by altering climate (mean annual precipitation, drought) and soil properties (pH, soil organic carbon, and clay content) in the structural equation model, whereas soil seed richness was controlled by geography (altitude, and latitude) via climate (mean annual precipitation). In summary, the results suggested the size of SSBs response to drought and its relationship with drought intensity in terrestrial ecosystems, it may shed light on ecosystem restoration, succession, and management using SSBs when estimating the future drought.",This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFC1807704).,,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Ecosystem; Soil; Droughts; Seed Bank; Carbon,2022-12-23,2022,2022-12-23,2023-03,864,,161142,Closed,Article,"Du, Zhongyu; Wang, Jia; An, Hui; Zhang, Handan; Chen, Guangcai","Du, Zhongyu (Research Institute of Subtropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Hangzhou 311400, China.); Wang, Jia (Research Institute of Subtropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Hangzhou 311400, China.); An, Hui (School of Ecology and Environment, Ningxia University, Breeding Base for State Key Lab. of Land Degradation and Ecological Restoration in Northwestern China, Key Lab. of Restoration and Reconstruction of Degraded Ecosystems in Northwestern China of Ministry of Education, Yinchuan 750021, China.); Zhang, Handan (Research Institute of Subtropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Hangzhou 311400, China.); Chen, Guangcai (Research Institute of Subtropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Hangzhou 311400, China.

Exogenous carbon (C) input into soils can induce SOC decomposition or sequestration. The response of SOC to C input can be better understood when SOC is separated into mineral-associated (MAOC) and particulate (POC) organic carbon. The objective of this study is to explore whether exogenous C input promote MAOC and POC increase or decrease and the controlling factors. We gained 1181 observations from 17 studies for this meta-analysis. The effect sizes of exogenous C input on MAOC and POC content, and MAOC decomposition were calculated. The key factors influencing the effect sizes were explored through subgroup analysis. Potential publication bias was explored by using funnel plots, trim and fill method, and Egger's test. Exogenous C input significantly increased MAOC and POC content, although promoted MAOC decomposition. The effect sizes were larger for MAOC content than for POC content irrespective of soil and substrate properties and experiment methods. The effects of C input on MAOC and POC content were more pronounced in forest soils, and depended on the C and nitrogen (N) content in soil and substrates as well as experiment methods. The effect size of C input on MAOC decomposition were larger with substrate input of below 200 g C kg-1 in specific soils. The sensitivity analysis carried out by removing one observation indicated our results were robust. In conclusion, exogenous C input increases MAOC and POC content although stimulate MAOC decomposition, and the effect sizes were influenced mainly by ecosystem type, carbon and nitrogen content of substrates and soils, and fractionation methods. The findings indicate the importance of C and N content in substrates and soils in controlling the response of SOC rather than the ratio of C to N.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no competing financial interest.

Nevertheless, practices such as no- or reduced tillage, application of organic soil amendments, and maintenance of continuous cover can increase SOC in agricultural fields. While these management practices have been well studied, the effects on SOC of cropping systems that incorporate irrigation are poorly understood. Given the large, and expanding, agricultural landbase under irrigation across the globe, this is a critical knowledge gap for climate change mitigation. We undertook a systematic literature review and subsequent meta-analysis of data from studies that examined changes in SOC on irrigated agricultural sites through time. We investigated changes in SOC by climate (aridity), soil texture, and irrigation method with the following objectives: (i) to examine the impact of irrigated agriculture on SOC storage; and (ii) to identify the conditions under which irrigated agriculture is most likely to enhance SOC. Overall, irrigated agriculture increased SOC stocks by 5.9%, with little effect of study length (2-47 years). However, changes in SOC varied by climate and soil depth, with the greatest increase in SOC observed on irrigated semi-arid sites at the 0-10 cm depth (14.8%). Additionally, SOC increased in irrigated fine- and medium-textured soils but not coarse-textured soils. Furthermore, while there was no overall change to SOC in flood/furrow irrigated sites, SOC tended to increase in sprinkler irrigated sites, and decrease in drip irrigated sites, especially at depths below 10 cm. This work sheds light on the nuances of SOC change across irrigated agricultural systems, highlights the importance of studying SOC storage in deeper soils, and will help guide future research on the impacts of irrigated agriculture on SOC.","This work was funded by the Agricultural Greenhouse Gases Program of Agriculture and Agri‐food Canada (Project AAGP2‐25).

Cover cropping is a key practice to increase system net primary productivity (NPP) and increase the quantity of high-quality plant residues available for integration into soil organic matter (SOM). Cover crop management and local environmental conditions, however, influence the magnitude of soil C stock change. Here, we used a comprehensive meta-analysis approach to quantify the effect of cover crops on soil C stocks from the 0-30 cm soil depth in temperate climates and to identify key management and ecological factors that impact variation in this response. A total of 40 publications with 181 observations were included in the meta-analysis representing six countries across three different continents. Overall, cover crops had a strong positive effect on soil C stocks (P < 0.0001) leading to a 12% increase, averaging 1.11 Mg C/ha more soil C relative to a no cover crop control. The strongest predictors of SOC response to cover cropping were planting and termination date (i.e., growing window), annual cover crop biomass production, and soil clay content. Cover crops planted as continuous cover or autumn planted and terminated led to 20-30% greater total soil C stocks relative to other cover crop growing windows. Likewise, high annual cover crop biomass production (>7 Mg·ha-1 ·yr-1 ) resulted in 30% higher total soil C stocks than lower levels of biomass production. Managing for greater NPP by improving synchronization in cover crop growing windows and climate will enhance the capacity of this practice to drawdown carbon dioxide (CO2 ) from the atmosphere across agroecosystems. The integration of growing window (potentially as a proxy for biomass growth), climate, and soil factors in decision-support tools are relevant for improving the quantification of soil C stock change under cover crops, particularly with the expansion of terrestrial soil C markets.","We are grateful for financial support from the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute for Food and Agriculture, award number 2016‐51106‐25712.

However, the effects of different concentrations and types of MPs on soil ecosystem are still unclear. Here, a comprehensive meta-analysis was performed to examine the responses of 19 variables, associated with soil properties, microbes, enzymes, and fauna, to MPs, based on 114 peer-reviewed studies. The results showed that the addition of MPs significantly reduced the soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), NH4+-N, pH, and diversity of bacteria, and increased the dissolved organic carbon (DOC), diversity of fungi and enzyme activities, especially enzymes related to the biogeochemical cycle. We further discussed that soil MPs exerted negative effects on soil fauna, including survival, growth, and reproduction, and that the concentration of MPs, rather than the type, was the biggest driving factor causing the toxicity of MPs affecting soil animals. More importantly, the concentrations of MPs were the main factor affecting the DOC, TN, NO3--N, total phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), and diversity of fungi, whereas the types of MPs were the main factors reflected in the SOC, NH4+-N, pH, diversity of bacteria, and enzyme activities. This study aimed to evaluate the response of soil ecosystems to the different concentrations and types of MPs, and the largest driving factor for the toxicity of MPs.","We thank all people for helping us to complete the research.

The establishment of mixed plantations is a promising way to store carbon (C) in soil compared with monocultures. However, monoculture forests largely dominate the rapid increase in forest areas in China. To optimize afforestation strategies and maximize the subsequent potential of C sequestration, we conducted a meta-analysis with 427 observations across 176 study sites in China. The goal was to quantify changes in the stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) in mixed plantations compared with monocultures and to identify the predominant drivers for the stocks of SOC, including geological location, climatic factors, land use history, edaphic properties, plantation age, the inclusion of nitrogen-fixing trees, mixing proportion, and mixed plant types. The results showed that mixed plantations significantly increased the SOC stocks by 12% compared with monocultures, and the mixing proportion should not exceed 55% to produce higher SOC stocks in mixed plantations compared with monoculture. Additionally, mixed plantations in barren land are the most likely to increase the SOC stocks with limited water or low temperatures for growth. Additional measures instead of mixed plantations should be explored to increase SOC stocks in north, central, and northwest China. The data from this study demonstrated the spatiotemporal variability on the storage of SOC driven by mixed trees and has valuable implications for the establishment and management of afforestation.","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFF0305905), Scientific Research Fund Project of Guizhou Education University (2020BS019), Natural Science Foundation of China (32101431), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Non-profit Research Institution of Chinese Academy of Forestry (CAFYBB2020ZE005), Starting Research Fund of Team Construction of Lanzhou University ‘Double First-Rate’ project (561120207), Research Fund Program of Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology (2020B1212060022), and Science and Technology Foundation of Guizhou Province ([2019]2834).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Biodiversity; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; China; Ecosystem; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Forests; Organic Chemicals; Soil,2022-01-29,2022,2022-01-29,2022-05,821,,153449,Closed,Article,"Xiang, Yangzhou; Li, Yuan; Luo, Xuqiang; Liu, Ying; Huang, Pei; Yao, Bin; Zhang, Leiyi; Li, Wenli; Xue, Jianming; Gao, Hongjuan; Li, Yonghua; Zhang, Wei","Xiang, Yangzhou (Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Geographic State Monitoring of Watershed, School of Geography and Resources, Guizhou Education University, Guiyang 550018, China; Institute of Desertification Studies, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Beijing 100091, China.); Li, Yuan (State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-ecosystems, College of Pastoral Agriculture Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730020, China.); Luo, Xuqiang (Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Geographic State Monitoring of Watershed, School of Geography and Resources, Guizhou Education University, Guiyang 550018, China.); Liu, Ying (School of Biological Sciences, Guizhou Education University, Guiyang 550018, China.); Huang, Pei (Institute of Desertification Studies, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Beijing 100091, China; Institute of Ecological Conservation and Restoration, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Beijing 100091, China; State Forestry Administration Dunhuang Desert Ecosystem Location Research Station, Dunhuang 736200, China.); Yao, Bin (Institute of Desertification Studies, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Beijing 100091, China; Institute of Ecological Conservation and Restoration, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Beijing 100091, China; State Forestry Administration Dunhuang Desert Ecosystem Location Research Station, Dunhuang 736200, China.

Here, we hypothesized that the silt and clay contents in soils as well as the clay mineralogy are the main factors affecting the maximal C and N storage levels of soils. This hypothesis was evaluated using a database containing the organic C contents of topsoils separated by ultrasonic dispersion to determine the particle size fractions. The slopes of the linear regressions between the C contents in silt and clay to the soil organic C (SOC) and between the N contents in silt and clay to the total N content were independent of the clay mineralogy (2:1, 1:1, calcareous soil, amorphous clays), climate type (tropical, temperate, and Mediterranean), and land use type (cropland, grassland, and forest). This clearly shows that the silt and clay content is the main factor defining an upper SOC level, which allowed us to propose a generalized linear regression (R2 > 0.95) model with a common slope, independent of the land use and climate type, to estimate the soil C sequestration potential. The implications of these findings are as follows: (1) a common slope regression was accurately calculated (0.83 ± 0.02 for C-silt + clay < 63 μm and 0.81 ± 0.02 for C-silt + clay < 20 μm) and (2) there was no asymptotic pattern found to support the existence of an SOC saturation pool.","We are indebted to Sergio Muñoz (Universidad de La Frontera), Yakov Kuzyakov (Göttingen University), Irina Kuzyakova (Göttingen University), Denis Angers (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, and Rota Wagai (NARO Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences from Japan) for their contribution to the statistics and thorough discussion on the early version of this manuscript.

6412,pub.1155599158,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162269,36813188,,Contribution of agricultural land conversion to global GHG emissions: A meta-analysis,"Greenhouse gases (GHG) have extensive environmental effects by trapping heat and causing climate change and air pollution. Land plays a key role in the global cycles of GHG (i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrogen oxide (N2O)), and land use change (LUC) can lead to the release of such gases into the atmosphere or the removal of them from the atmosphere. One of the most common forms of LUC is agricultural land conversion (ALC) where agricultural lands are converted for other uses. This study aimed to review 51 original papers from 1990 to 2020 that investigate the contribution of ALC to GHG emissions from a spatiotemporal perspective using a meta-analysis method. The results of spatiotemporal effects on GHG emissions showed that the effects were significant. The emissions were affected by different continent regions representing the spatial effects. The most significant spatial effect was relevant to African and Asian countries. In addition, the quadratic relationship between ALC and GHG emissions had the highest significant coefficients, showing an upward concave curve. Therefore, increasing ALC to more than 8 % of available land led to increasing GHG emissions during the economic development process. The implications of the current study are important for policymakers from two perspectives. First, to achieve sustainable economic development, policymaking should prevent the conversion of more than 90 % of agricultural land to other uses based on the turning point of the second model. Second, policies to control global GHG emissions should take into account spatial effects (e.g., continental Africa and Asia), which show the highest contribution to GHG emissions.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Carbon farming provides useful benefits for soil health, biomass production, and crop resilience, but the effects of different soil C sequestration approaches on the nitrogen (N) cycle remain controversial. While some C farming practices have been shown to reduce N fertilizer use in some cases, C farming could also impose an unwanted ""N penalty"" through which soil C gains can only be maintained with additional N inputs, thereby increasing N losses to the environment. We systematically reviewed meta-analysis studies on the impacts of C farming on N cycling in agroecosystems and estimated the cumulative effect of several C farming practices on N cycling. We found that, on average, combined C farming practices significantly reduced nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching from soils, thus inferring both N cycling and climate change benefits. In addition to more widely studied C farming practices that generate organic C, we also discuss silicate rock additions, which offer a pathway to inorganic C sequestration that does not require additional N inputs, framing important questions for future research.",Acknowledgments California&#x27;s Strategic Growth Council provided funding to support the research.

A systematic map protocol,"BackgroundNatural climate solutions (NCS)—actions to conserve, restore, and modify natural and modified ecosystems to increase carbon storage or avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—are increasingly regarded as important pathways for climate change mitigation, while contributing to our global conservation efforts, overall planetary resilience, and sustainable development goals. Recently, projections posit that terrestrial-based NCS can potentially capture or avoid the emission of at least 11 Gt (gigatons) of carbon dioxide equivalent a year, or roughly encompassing one third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the Paris Climate Agreement goals by 2030. NCS interventions also purport to provide co-benefits such as improved productivity and livelihoods from sustainable natural resource management, protection of locally and culturally important natural areas, and downstream climate adaptation benefits. Attention on implementing NCS to address climate change across global and national agendas has grown—however, clear understanding of which types of NCS interventions have undergone substantial study versus those that require additional evidence is still lacking. This study aims to conduct a systematic map to collate and describe the current state, distribution, and methods used for evidence on the links between NCS interventions and climate change mitigation outcomes within tropical and sub-tropical terrestrial ecosystems. Results of this study can be used to inform program and policy design and highlight critical knowledge gaps where future evaluation, research, and syntheses are needed.MethodsTo develop this systematic map, we will search two bibliographic databases (including 11 indices) and 67 organization websites, backward citation chase from 39 existing evidence syntheses, and solicit information from key informants. All searches will be conducted in English and encompass subtropical and tropical terrestrial ecosystems (forests, grasslands, mangroves, agricultural areas). Search results will be screened at title and abstract, and full text levels, recording both the number of excluded articles and reasons for exclusion. Key meta-data from included articles will be coded and reported in a narrative review that will summarize trends in the evidence base, assess gaps in knowledge, and provide insights for policy, practice, and research. The data from this systematic map will be made open access.","The authors thank the advisory group members (A. Roopsind, P. Brancalion, C. Zganjar, J. Brandt, L.

6385,pub.1146835037,10.1002/eap.2611,35366042,,Disturbance and management effects on forest soil organic carbon stocks in the Pacific Northwest,"Carbon (C)-informed forest management requires understanding how disturbance and management influence soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at scales relevant to landowners and forest policy and management professionals. The continued growth of data sets and publications allows powerful synthesis approaches to be applied to such questions at increasingly fine scales. Here, we report results from a synthesis that used meta-analysis of published studies and two large observational databases to quantify disturbance and management impacts on SOC stocks. We conducted this, the third in a series of ecoregional SOC assessments, for the Pacific Northwest, which comprises ~8% of the land area but ~12% of the U.S. forest sector C sink. At the ecoregional level, our analysis indicated that fundamental patterns of vegetation, climate, and topography are far more important controls on SOC stocks than land use history, disturbance, or management. However, the same patterns suggested that increased warming, drying, wildland fire, and forest regeneration failure pose significant risks to SOC stocks across the region. Detailed meta-analysis results indicated that wildfires diminished SOC stocks throughout the soil profile, while prescribed fire only influenced surface organic materials and harvesting had no significant overall impact on SOC. Independent observational data corroborated the negative influence of fire on SOC derived from meta-analysis, suggested that harvest impacts may vary subregionally with climate or vegetation, and revealed that forests with agricultural uses (e.g., grazing) or legacies (e.g., cultivation) had smaller SOC stocks. We also quantified effects of a range of common forest management practices having either positive (organic amendments, nitrogen [N]-fixing vegetation establishment, inorganic N fertilization) or no overall effects on SOC (other inorganic fertilizers, urea fertilization, competition suppression through herbicides). In order to maximize the management applications of our results, we qualified them with ratings of confidence based on degree of support across approaches. Last, similar to earlier published assessments from other ecoregions, we supplemented our quantitative synthesis results with a literature review to arrive at a concise set of tactics for adapting management operations to site-specific criteria.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Alexander O&#x27;Neill and Nickolas Viau for their careful literature review and GIS work, respectively, Stephanie Connolly and Evan Kane for helpful discussions of soil organic matter and forest management, and two anonymous reviewers for feedback that improved this manuscript through peer review.

This study reports a worldwide meta-analysis of 131 peer-reviewed publications, to quantify potential SOC and STN accumulation in orchard soils induced by organic fertilization and cover cropping. Annual gains of 3.73 Mg C/ha and 0.38 Mg N/ha were realized with the introduction of organic fertilizer, while cover crop management led to annual increases of 2.00 Mg C/ha and 0.20 Mg N/ha. The SOC and STN accumulation rates depended mostly on climatic conditions and initial SOC and STN content. The SOC and STN accumulated fastest during the first three years of cover crop implementation, at 2.98 Mg C/ha/yr and 0.25 Mg N/ha/yr and declined thereafter. Organic fertilization caused significantly more annual SOC and STN accumulation at higher (400-800 mm) than lower (<400 mm) rainfall levels. When cover cropping for more than five years, SOC accumulated the fastest with <800 mm of mean annual rainfall. Organic fertilization led to faster SOC accumulation with mean annual temperature between 15 and 20 °C than >20 °C. Organic amendments led to the slowest SOC accumulation rate when the initial SOC concentration was <10 g C/kg. This study provides policy makers and orchard managers science-based evidence to help guide adaptive management practices that build SOC stocks, improve soil conditions and enhance resilience of orchard systems to climate change.","This work was supported by the earmarked fund for National Natural Science Foundation of China (31902116), China Agriculture Research System (CARS-22, Green Manure) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (7110100819, Southwest University).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Soil; Carbon; Nitrogen; Fertilizers; Agriculture; Carbon Sequestration; Fertilization,2022-08-31,2022,2022-08-31,2022-12,852,,158402,Closed,Article,"Hu, Yingxiao; Zhan, Pengjie; Thomas, Ben W; Zhao, Jingkun; Zhang, Xueliang; Yan, He; Zhang, Zhibin; Chen, Shuang; Shi, Xiaojun; Zhang, Yuting","Hu, Yingxiao (College of Resources and Environment, Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.); Zhan, Pengjie (College of Resources and Environment, Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.); Thomas, Ben W (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Agassiz Research and Development Centre, Agassiz, British Columbia V0M 1A0, Canada.); Zhao, Jingkun (Chongqing Agricultural Technology Extension Station, Chongqing 401121, China.); Zhang, Xueliang (College of Resources and Environment, Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.); Yan, He (College of Resources and Environment, Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.); Zhang, Zhibin (College of Resources and Environment, Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.); Chen, Shuang (College of Resources and Environment, Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.); Shi, Xiaojun (College of Resources and Environment, Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Efficient Utilization of Soil and Fertilizer Resources, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.); Zhang, Yuting (College of Resources and Environment, Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.

Furthermore, previously published cover crop research has largely focused on evaluating cover crop impacts on subsequent crop yield. Understanding the cover crop-induced benefits on soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, wind and water erosion, weed control, and soil microbial communities has gained considerable attention in the last few decades, which is crucial to make progress towards developing sustainable agricultural production systems. New research is continuously published to gain a comprehensive understanding of the multiple ecosystem services provided by cover crops. Here, in this review, we aimed to (a) summarize current knowledge related to cover crop impacts on agroecosystem functioning and explore the potential mechanisms responsible for those effects, and (b) identify the key factors limiting the adoption of cover crops into agroecosystems and the conspicuous knowledge gaps in cover crop research. Overall, the review results suggest that cover crops increased subsequent crop yield, increased SOC storage, increased weed suppression, mitigated N2O emissions, reduced wind and water erosion, suppressed plant pathogens, and increased soil microbial activity and wildlife biodiversity. However, the magnitude of benefits observed with cover crops varied with cover crop type, location, and the duration of cover cropping. Notably, cover crop termination methods, designing crop rotations to fit cover crops, additional costs associated with cover crop integration, and uncertainty related to economic returns with cover crops are some of the major barriers limiting the adoption of cover crops into production systems, particularly in North America. In addition to long-term effects, future research on cover crop agronomy, breeding cover crop cultivars, and interactive effects of cover crops with other sustainable land management practices is needed.","Authors gratefully thank A.

6376,pub.1141449998,10.1111/gcb.15906,34583427,,Net effects of conservation agriculture principles on sustainable land use: A synthesis,"Despite the strong recommendations from scientists, to till or not to till remains a confusing question for many farmers around the world due to the worries of crop yield decline and negative impacts on soils and environment. A confused understanding of the role of the individual principles of conservation agriculture significantly limits the effectiveness and applicability of soil conservation strategies and frameworks to achieve sustainable agriculture. By distinguishing clearly between the different principles of conservation agriculture, the net effects of no-tillage on improving and sustaining agro-ecosystems are analyzed based on 49 recent meta-analyses in this study. The review shows that no-tillage leads to a significant decline of crop yield (-8.0% to 10.0%, median: -1.9%), whereas residue retention represents the key driver for improving crop production (4.0%-28.0%, median: 8.2%). The efficacy of no-tillage for water erosion control, especially runoff (-24.0% to -0.7%, median: -10.0%), is often insignificant and otherwise lower compared to residue retention (-87.0% to -14.0%, median: -45.5%). Soil carbon sequestration potential under conservation tillage is quite limited or even close to zero, and if any, it can likely be attributed to the associated residue retention (-0.1% to 12.8%, median: 9.7%) rather than no-tillage (-2.0% to 10.0%, median: 4.8%). Our analysis illustrates that in conservation agriculture, no-tillage as the original and central principle of soil management is often less effective than associated supplementary measures, in particular residue retention. Residue retention may therefore play a key role for achieving sustainable land use. An additional benefit of residue retention is the less dramatic change of farming practices compared to no-tillage. The results of this review illustrate that a new framework for assessing the benefits of conservation practices has to be developed. To till, or not to till, is not the question: residue retention seems more critical.","This research was jointly funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province (grant no. 212300410199), Key Scientific Research Project of Colleges and Universities of Henan Province (grant no. 21A210026), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 41971241).",,Global Change Biology,,,Agriculture; Carbon Sequestration; Crop Production; Ecosystem; Soil,2021-10-08,2021,2021-10-08,2021-12,27,24,6321-6330,Closed,Article,"Xiao, Liangang; Kuhn, Nikolaus J.; Zhao, Rongqin; Cao, Lianhai","Xiao, Liangang (College of Surveying and Geo‐informatics, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, Zhengzhou, China); Kuhn, Nikolaus J.

However, the impact of legume pre-crops on main crop yield and its drivers has never been systematically investigated in a global context. Here, we synthesize 11,768 yield observations from 462 field experiments comparing legume-based and non-legume cropping systems and show that legumes enhanced main crop yield by 20%. These yield advantages decline with increasing N fertilizer rates and crop diversity of the main cropping system. The yield benefits are consistent among main crops (e.g., rice, wheat, maize) and evident across pedo-climatic regions. Moreover, greater yield advantages (32% vs. 7%) are observed in low- vs. high-yielding environments, suggesting legumes increase crop production with low inputs (e.g., in Africa or organic agriculture). In conclusion, our study suggests that legume-based rotations offer a critical pathway for enhancing global crop production, especially when integrated into low-input and low-diversity agricultural systems.","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32101850, H.D.Z.; 32172125, Z.H.Z.), the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (2020QNRC001, H.D.Z.), the Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U21A20218, Z.H.Z.) and the earmarked fund for China Agriculture Research System (CARS-07-B-5, Z.H.Z.).

However, the aging effect of biochar on soils remains elusive, which introduces uncertainty on the effectiveness of biochar to mitigate global warming in a long term. Here, a meta-analysis of 22 published works of literature with 217 observations was conducted to systematically explore the aging effect of biochar on soil NH3 and GHGs emissions. The results show that, in comparison with the fresh biochar, the aging makes biochar more effective to decrease soil NH3 volatilization by 7% and less risk to contribute CH4 emissions by 11%. However, the mitigation effect of biochar on soil N2O emissions is decreased by 15% due to aging. Additionally, aging leads to a promotion effect on soil CO2 emissions by 25% than fresh biochar. Our findings suggest that along with aging, particularly the effect of artificial aging, biochar could further benefit the alleviation of soil NH3 volatilization, whereas its potential role to mitigate global warming may decrease. This study provides a systematic assessment of the aging effect of biochar to mitigate soil NH3 and GHGs, which can provide a scientific basis for the sustainable green development of biochar application.","We appreciate the funding by the Jiangsu Agricultural Science and Technology Independent Innovation Fund, China (CX(19)1007), National Natural Science Foundation of China, China (41877090) and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China (BK20200057, BK20200775).",,Environmental Pollution,,,Agriculture; Charcoal; Greenhouse Gases; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Volatilization,2021-11-30,2021,2021-11-30,2022-02,294,,118598,Closed,Article,"Feng, Yuanyuan; Feng, Yanfang; Liu, Qi; Chen, Sen; Hou, Pengfu; Poinern, Gerrard; Jiang, Zhongtao; Fawcett, Derek; Xue, Lihong; Lam, Su Shiung; Xia, Changlei","Feng, Yuanyuan (Key Laboratory of Agro-Environment in Downstream of Yangtze Plain, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Food Quality and Safety / State Key Laboratory Cultivation Base of Ministry of Science and Technology, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China; Murdoch Applied Innovation Nanotechnology Research Group / Surface Analysis and Materials Engineering Research Group, College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University, Perth, WA, 5150, Australia.); Feng, Yanfang (Key Laboratory of Agro-Environment in Downstream of Yangtze Plain, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Food Quality and Safety / State Key Laboratory Cultivation Base of Ministry of Science and Technology, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China.); Liu, Qi (Co-Innovation Center for Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Nanjing Forestry University, No. 159, Longpan Road, Nanjing, 210037, China.); Chen, Sen (Co-Innovation Center for Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Nanjing Forestry University, No. 159, Longpan Road, Nanjing, 210037, China.); Hou, Pengfu (Key Laboratory of Agro-Environment in Downstream of Yangtze Plain, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Food Quality and Safety / State Key Laboratory Cultivation Base of Ministry of Science and Technology, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China.); Poinern, Gerrard (Murdoch Applied Innovation Nanotechnology Research Group / Surface Analysis and Materials Engineering Research Group, College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University, Perth, WA, 5150, Australia.); Jiang, Zhongtao (Murdoch Applied Innovation Nanotechnology Research Group / Surface Analysis and Materials Engineering Research Group, College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University, Perth, WA, 5150, Australia.); Fawcett, Derek (Murdoch Applied Innovation Nanotechnology Research Group / Surface Analysis and Materials Engineering Research Group, College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University, Perth, WA, 5150, Australia.); Xue, Lihong (Key Laboratory of Agro-Environment in Downstream of Yangtze Plain, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Food Quality and Safety / State Key Laboratory Cultivation Base of Ministry of Science and Technology, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China.

More environmentally sustainable foods could incur higher costs for consumers. In this review, we explore whether consumers are willing to pay (WTP) more for foods with environmental sustainability labels ('ecolabels'). Six electronic databases were searched for experiments on consumers' willingness to pay for ecolabelled food. Monetary values were converted to Purchasing Power Parity dollars and adjusted for country-specific inflation. Studies were meta-analysed and effect sizes with confidence intervals were calculated for the whole sample and for pre-specified subgroups defined as meat-dairy, seafood, and fruits-vegetables-nuts. Meta-regressions tested the role of label attributes and demographic characteristics on participants' WTP. Forty-three discrete choice experiments (DCEs) with 41,777 participants were eligible for inclusion. Thirty-five DCEs (n = 35,725) had usable data for the meta-analysis. Participants were willing to pay a premium of 3.79 PPP$/kg (95%CI 2.7, 4.89, p ≤ 0.001) for ecolabelled foods. WTP was higher for organic labels compared to other labels. Women and people with lower levels of education expressed higher WTP. Ecolabels may increase consumers' willingness to pay more for environmentally sustainable products and could be part of a strategy to encourage a transition to more sustainable diets.",,"The research was funded by the Wellcome Trust, Our Planet Our Health programme (Livestock, Environment and People—LEAP), award number 205212/Z/16/Z.",Nutrients,,"Joerg Koenigstorfer, Daniela Martini","Consumer Behavior; Databases, Factual; Food; Food Labeling; Food, Organic; Humans",2021-07-31,2021,2021-07-31,,13,8,2677,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bastounis, Anastasios; Buckell, John; Hartmann-Boyce, Jamie; Cook, Brian; King, Sarah; Potter, Christina; Bianchi, Filippo; Rayner, Mike; Jebb, Susan A.","Bastounis, Anastasios (Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6GG, UK;, Anastasios.Bastounis1@nottingham.ac.uk, (A.B.);, john.buckell@ndph.ox.ac.uk, (J.B.);, Jamie.hartmann-boyce@phc.ox.ac.uk, (J.H.-B.);, seking100@googlemail.com, (S.K.);, Christina.Potter@Nicklaushealth.org, (C.P.);, filippo.bianchi@phc.ox.ac.uk, (F.B.);, susan.jebb@phc.ox.ac.uk, (S.A.J.); Division of Epidemiology & Public Health, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, City Hospital, Hucknall Road, Nottingham NG5 1PB, UK); Buckell, John (Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6GG, UK;, Anastasios.Bastounis1@nottingham.ac.uk, (A.B.);, john.buckell@ndph.ox.ac.uk, (J.B.);, Jamie.hartmann-boyce@phc.ox.ac.uk, (J.H.-B.);, seking100@googlemail.com, (S.K.);, Christina.Potter@Nicklaushealth.org, (C.P.);, filippo.bianchi@phc.ox.ac.uk, (F.B.);, susan.jebb@phc.ox.ac.uk, (S.A.J.); Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford Richard Doll Building, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK;, mike.rayner@ndp.ox.ac.uk); Hartmann-Boyce, Jamie (Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6GG, UK;, Anastasios.Bastounis1@nottingham.ac.uk, (A.B.);, john.buckell@ndph.ox.ac.uk, (J.B.);, Jamie.hartmann-boyce@phc.ox.ac.uk, (J.H.-B.);, seking100@googlemail.com, (S.K.);, Christina.Potter@Nicklaushealth.org, (C.P.);, filippo.bianchi@phc.ox.ac.uk, (F.B.);, susan.jebb@phc.ox.ac.uk, (S.A.J.)); Cook, Brian (Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6GG, UK;, Anastasios.Bastounis1@nottingham.ac.uk, (A.B.);, john.buckell@ndph.ox.ac.uk, (J.B.);, Jamie.hartmann-boyce@phc.ox.ac.uk, (J.H.-B.);, seking100@googlemail.com, (S.K.);, Christina.Potter@Nicklaushealth.org, (C.P.);, filippo.bianchi@phc.ox.ac.uk, (F.B.);, susan.jebb@phc.ox.ac.uk, (S.A.J.)); King, Sarah (Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6GG, UK;, Anastasios.Bastounis1@nottingham.ac.uk, (A.B.);, john.buckell@ndph.ox.ac.uk, (J.B.);, Jamie.hartmann-boyce@phc.ox.ac.uk, (J.H.-B.);, seking100@googlemail.com, (S.K.);, Christina.Potter@Nicklaushealth.org, (C.P.);, filippo.bianchi@phc.ox.ac.uk, (F.B.);, susan.jebb@phc.ox.ac.uk, (S.A.J.)); Potter, Christina (Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6GG, UK;, Anastasios.Bastounis1@nottingham.ac.uk, (A.B.);, john.buckell@ndph.ox.ac.uk, (J.B.);, Jamie.hartmann-boyce@phc.ox.ac.uk, (J.H.-B.);, seking100@googlemail.com, (S.K.);, Christina.Potter@Nicklaushealth.org, (C.P.);, filippo.bianchi@phc.ox.ac.uk, (F.B.);, susan.jebb@phc.ox.ac.uk, (S.A.J.)); Bianchi, Filippo (Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6GG, UK;, Anastasios.Bastounis1@nottingham.ac.uk, (A.B.);, john.buckell@ndph.ox.ac.uk, (J.B.);, Jamie.hartmann-boyce@phc.ox.ac.uk, (J.H.-B.);, seking100@googlemail.com, (S.K.);, Christina.Potter@Nicklaushealth.org, (C.P.);, filippo.bianchi@phc.ox.ac.uk, (F.B.);, susan.jebb@phc.ox.ac.uk, (S.A.J.)); Rayner, Mike (Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford Richard Doll Building, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK;, mike.rayner@ndp.ox.ac.uk); Jebb, Susan A.

Here, a meta-analysis of 999 paired data points from 194 studies shows that biochar increases microbial biomass but has variable effects on microbial diversity. Generally, the effects of biochar on microbial biomass are dependent on biochar properties, while that on microbial diversity is dependent on soil properties. The application of biochar, particularly that produced under low temperature and from nutrient-rich feedstocks, could better increase soil microbial biomass (based on phospholipid fatty acid analysis (MBCPLFA)) and diversity. The increases of total microbial biomass with biochar addition are greater in the field than in laboratory studies, in sandy than in clay soils, and when measured by fumigation-extraction (MBCFE) than by MBCPLFA. The bacterial biomass only significantly increases in laboratory studies and fungal biomass only in soils with pH ≤ 7.5 and soil organic carbon ≤30 g kg-1. The increases in total microbial diversity with biochar addition were greater in acidic and sandy soils with low soil organic carbon content and in laboratory incubation studies. In addition, long-term and low-rate addition of biochar always increases microbial diversity. To better guide the use of biochar as a soil amendment, we suggest that establishing long-term and field studies, using a standard method for measuring microbial communities, on different soil types should be our emphasis in future research.","We thank Prof. Marta Camps-Arbestain for her critical review of an earlier version of this manuscript and Dr. Zilong Ma for his help in data analysis during revision.

6345,pub.1138772466,10.1111/gcb.15747,34114719,,Positive but variable effects of crop diversification on biodiversity and ecosystem services,"Ecological theory suggests that biodiversity has a positive and stabilizing effect on the delivery of ecosystem services. Yet, the impacts of increasing the diversity of cultivated crop species or varieties in agroecosystems are still under scrutiny. The available empirical evidence is scattered in scope, agronomic and geographic contexts, and impacts on ecosystem services may depend on the type of diversification strategy used. To robustly assess the effects of crop diversification in agroecosystems, we compiled the results of 95 meta-analyses integrating 5156 experiments conducted over 84 experimental years and representing more than 54,500 paired observations on 120 crop species in 85 countries. Overall, our synthesis of experimental data from across the globe shows that crop diversification enhances not only crop production (median effect +14%) but also the associated biodiversity (+24%, i.e., the biodiversity of non-cultivated plants and animals), and several supporting and regulating ecosystem services including water quality (+51%), pest and disease control (+63%) and soil quality (+11%). However, there was substantial variability in the results for each individual ecosystem service between different diversification strategies such as agroforestry, intercropping, cover crops, crop rotation or variety mixtures. Agroforestry is particularly effective in delivering multiple ecosystem services, that is, water regulation and quality, pest and diseases regulation, associated biodiversity, long-term soil productivity and quality. Variety mixtures, instead, provide the lowest benefits, whereas the other strategies show intermediate results. Our results highlight that while increasing the diversity of cultivated crop species or varieties in agroecosystems represents a very promising strategy for more sustainable land management, contributing to enhanced yields, enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem services, some crop diversification strategies are more effective than others in supporting key ecosystem services.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was produced within the framework of the European project “Diversification through Rotation, Intercropping, Multiple Cropping, Promoted with Actors and value‐Chains towards Sustainability” (DiverIMPACTS), funded by the European Commission under Grant Agreement number 727482.

However, both field and pot experiments show a vast range of effects, from strong reductions to strong increases in runoff and/or soil erosion. Therefore, this study aimed to quantify and interpret the impacts of biochar on runoff and soil erosion through the first systematic meta-analysis on this topic. The developed dataset consists of 184 pairwise observations for runoff and soil erosion from 30 independent studies but 8 of which just focused on soil erosion. Overall, biochar application to soil significantly reduced runoff by 25 % and erosion by 16 %. Mitigation of soil erosion in the tropics was approximately three times stronger (30 %) than at temperate latitudes (9 %); erosion reduction in the subtropical zone was 14 %, but not significantly different from either the tropical or temperate zones. Fewer reported field observations for runoff resulted in larger confidence intervals and only the temperate latitudes showed a significant effect (i.e. a 28 % reduction). At topsoil gravimetric biochar concentrations between 0.6 % and 2.5 %, significant reductions occurred in soil erosion, with no effect at lower and higher concentrations. Biochar experiments that included a vegetation cover reduced soil erosion more than twice as much as bare soil experiments, i.e. 27 % vs 12 %, respectively. This suggests that soil infiltration, canopy interception, and soil cohesion mechanisms may have synergistic effects. Soil amended with biochar pyrolyzed at >500 °C was associated with roughly double the erosion reduction than soil amended with biochar produced at 300-500 °C, which potentially could be related to the enhancement of hydrophobicity in the latter case. Our results demonstrate substantial potential for biochar to improve ecosystem services that are affected by increased infiltration and reduced erosion, while mechanistic understanding needs to be improved.","We acknowledge financial support to CESAM by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology FCT/MCTES (UIDP/50017/2020 + UIDB/50017/2020 + LA/P/0094/2020), through national funds.

Therefore, this study conducted a meta-analysis and literature review to assess carbon loss and to explore the main factors that impact carbon loss during organic solid waste (OSW) composting. The results indicated that over 40 % of carbon was lost through composting, mainly as CO2-C and merely as CH4-C. Experimental scale, feedstock varieties, composting systems, etc., all impacted the carbon loss, and there was generally higher carbon loss under optimal conditions (i.e., C/N ratio (15-25), pH (6.5-7.5), moisture content (65-75 %)). Most mitigation strategies in conventional composting (CC) systems (e.g., additive supplementary, feedstock adjustment, and optimized aeration, etc.) barely mediated the TC and CO2-C loss but dramatically reduced the emission of CH4-C through composting. Among them, feedstock adjustment by elevating the feedstock C/N ratio effectively reduced the TC loss, and chemical additives facilitated the conservation of both carbon and nitrogen. By comparison, there was generally higher carbon loss in the novel composting systems (e.g. hyperthermophilic and electric field enhanced composting, etc.). However, the impacts of different mitigation strategies and novel composting systems on carbon loss reduction through composting were probably underestimated for the inappropriate evaluation methods (composting period-dependent instead of maturity originated). Therefore, further studies are needed to explore carbon transformation through composting, to establish methods and standards for carbon loss evaluation, and to develop novel techniques and systems for enhanced carbon conservation through composting. Overall, the results of this study could provide a reference for carbon-friendly composting for future OSW management under the background of global carbon neutrality.","This work is funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFD1901402), National Natural Science Foundation of China (U20A2047), Key Research and Development Project for Tibet Autonomous Region (XZ202101ZD003N), Innovation Research 2035 Pilot Plan of Southwest University (SWU-XDZD22001) and Special projects for performance incentive and guidance of scientific research institutions of Chongqing (CQHKY-2022-STJJ-ZX-00009).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Humans; Carbon; Composting; Solid Waste; Carbon Dioxide; Nitrogen; Soil; Methane,2022-12-09,2022,2022-12-09,2023-03,862,,160787,Closed,Article,"Ye, Pingping; Fang, Linfa; Song, Dan; Zhang, Muyuan; Li, Ronghua; Awasthi, Mukesh Kumar; Zhang, Zengqiang; Xiao, Ran; Chen, Xinping","Ye, Pingping (Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.); Fang, Linfa (Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Key Laboratory of Low-carbon Green Agriculture in Southwestern China, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Chongqing 400715, China.); Song, Dan (Chongqing Academy of Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China.); Zhang, Muyuan (Chongqing Academy of Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China.); Li, Ronghua (College of Natural Resources and Environment, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China.); Awasthi, Mukesh Kumar (College of Natural Resources and Environment, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China.); Zhang, Zengqiang (College of Natural Resources and Environment, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China.); Xiao, Ran (Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Key Laboratory of Low-carbon Green Agriculture in Southwestern China, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Chongqing 400715, China.

Consequently, ridge-furrow rainwater harvesting is widely used in these regions across the globe. Despite ridge-furrow being widely practiced, tied-ridge-furrow has not been extensively adopted by small-scale farmers in semi-arid regions. Consequently, the effectiveness of tied-ridge-furrow as a viable method of increasing crop yield has received less attention.
METHODOLOGY: For large-scale implementation, a detailed assessment of how ridge furrow, tied-ridge-furrow with fertilizer, tied-ridge-furrow with mulching and tied-ridge-furrow without mulching or fertilizer influence crop yield in different agro-environments under varying climatic conditions is needed. This study used the PRISMA guidelines to determine the impact of tied-ridge-furrow rainwater harvesting technique with mulching or fertilizer on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) grain yields.
RESULTS: Sorghum grain yield increased by 17% greater in tied-ridge-furrow without mulching or fertilizer in comparison to flat planting. This may be due to increase in soil organic carbon in the region (9 g kg-1). Grain yield of millet significantly increased by 20-40% in Africa from 18 study observations in tied-ridge-furrow with fertilizer application as compared to tied-ridge-furrow without mulching or fertilizer treatments. This might be due to the significant increase in total nitrogen by 13-42% in the soil at <50 mg kg-1 quantity which had an effect size of 469.14 [65.60, 872.67]. In terms of soil texture, grain yield of millet and sorghum significantly increased in heavy textured soils (clay loam, silt clay, and clay soils) with an effect size of 469.14 [65.60, 872.67] compared to light and medium-textured soils of zero effect sizes. Millet and sorghum grain yields in tied-ridge-furrow with mulching, on the other hand, were not significantly different from those in flat planting. This may be due to the mulching materials used in those tests.
CONCLUSION: In view of yields of sorghum and millet increased significantly by 32% and 17% in tied-ridge-furrow without mulching or fertilizer treatment compared to flat planting and tied-ridge-furrow with fertilizer treatment compared with tied-ridge-furrow without mulching or fertilizer treatment, respectively, this study recommend the use of fertilizers in a tied-ridge-furrow system to increase grain yield in semiarid areas compared to flat planting. Again, the study recommends more research on tied-ridge-furrow systems with other organic mulches and fertilizers in semiarid areas.","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42061050 and 41661059).

However, there is considerable variability in the management and maturity criteria used across studies, and a systematic meta-analysis focused on compost maturity is currently lacking. This study investigated the optimal range of startup parameters and practical criteria for manure composting maturity, as well as the effectiveness of in situ technologies in enhancing composting maturity. Most maturity indexes were associated with composting GI, making it an ideal tool for evaluating the maturity of manure composts. GI increased with declined final C/N and (Final C/N)/(Initial C/N) (P < 0.01), and therefore a maturity assessment standard for animal manure composting was proposed: a mature compost has a C/N ratio ≤23 and a GI ≥70, while a highly mature compost has a GI ≥90 and preferably (Final C/N)/(Initial C/N) ≤0.8. Meta-analysis demonstrated that C/N ratio regulation, microbial inoculation and adding biochar and magnesium-phosphate salts are effective strategies for improving compost maturity. Specifically, a greater reduction in the C/N ratio during the composting process is beneficial for improving the maturity of compost product. The optimal startup parameters for composting have been determined, recommending an initial C/N ratio of 20-30 and an initial pH of 6.5-8.5. An initial C/N ratio of 26 was identified as the most suitable for promoting compost degradation and microorganism activity. The present results promoted a composting strategy for producing high-quality compost.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, there is a lack of consensus on the effect of pristine biochar on the net production, availability, and accumulation of methylmercury (MeHg) in the paddy rice-soil system. As such, a meta-analysis with 189 observations was performed to quantitatively assess the effects of biochar on Hg methylation, MeHg availability in paddy soil, and the accumulation of MeHg in paddy rice. Results suggested that biochar application could significantly increase the production of MeHg in paddy soil by 19.01%; biochar could also decrease the dissolved and available MeHg in paddy soil by 88.64% and 75.69%, respectively. More importantly, biochar application significantly inhibited the MeHg accumulation in paddy rice by 61.10%. These results highlight that biochar could decrease the availability of MeHg in paddy soil and thus inhibit MeHg accumulation in paddy rice, although it might facilitate the net production of MeHg in paddy soil. Additionally, results also indicated that the biochar feedstock and its elementary composition significantly impacted the net MeHg production in paddy soil. Generally, biochar with a low carbon content, high sulfur content, and low application rate might be beneficial for inhibiting Hg methylation in paddy soil, meaning that Hg methylation depends on biochar feedstock. These findings suggested that biochar has great potential to inhibit MeHg accumulation in paddy rice, and further research should focus on selecting biochar feedstock to control Hg methylation potential and determine its long-term effects.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Large-scale deployment of other climate mitigation strategies is also necessary. Among these, increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is an important lever because carbon in soils can be stored for long periods and land management options to achieve this already exist and have been widely tested. However, agricultural soils are also an important source of nitrous oxide (N2 O), a powerful greenhouse gas, and increasing SOC may influence N2 O emissions, likely causing an increase in many cases, thus tending to offset the climate change benefit from increased SOC storage. Here we review the main agricultural management options for increasing SOC stocks. We evaluate the amount of SOC that can be stored as well as resulting changes in N2 O emissions to better estimate the climate benefits of these management options. Based on quantitative data obtained from published meta-analyses and from our current level of understanding, we conclude that the climate mitigation induced by increased SOC storage is generally overestimated if associated N2 O emissions are not considered but, with the exception of reduced tillage, is never fully offset. Some options (e.g. biochar or non-pyrogenic C amendment application) may even decrease N2 O emissions.","This paper stemmed from a workshop ‘Emerging challenges in large scale soil carbon sequestration’ held in Paris on 8–10 October 2018.

The most common food related needs required are drastic changes of the current food production systems, diet change and food loss/waste reduction. As for agriculture no further land expansion is responsible and more food needs to be grown sustainably on less land and on healthy soils. For food processing, gentle, regenerative technologies have to generate healthy foods based on consumer requirements. Organic (ecological) food production is increasing worldwide but the interface between production and processing of organic foods is still hazy. This paper reviews the history and current state of organic agriculture and organic foods. Existing norms for organic food processing and urgent needs for their gentle, consumer-oriented processing are presented. Key issues such as production systems integration, water efficiency, plant and soil microbiota, biodiversity and supplementary food production systems are discussed. Processing of organic foods using fermentation, microbial/food biotechnological processes and sustainable technologies for retaining desirable nutrients and removing undesirable ones are proposed.

Despite the available studies conducted through high-throughput sequencing to understand the effects of biochar on soil bacterial diversity and richness, a comprehensive understanding remains elusive. Our global meta-analysis addresses this knowledge gap, incorporating 473 pairs of observations from 84 studies to assess soil bacterial diversity and richness response to biochar addition. We found that biochar application increased bacterial Shannon and Chao1 indices by 0.99 % and 6.45 % respectively. However, these positive effects were context-dependent, especially concerning bacterial diversity. Through aggregated boosted trees analysis, we determined that soil characteristics (including soil organic carbon and nitrogen contents, soil pH, and soil texture) had a more significant influence than biochar properties, experimental conditions, or climatic factors on soil bacterial diversity and richness post biochar addition. In particular, the soil carbon to nitrogen ratio stood out as the leading factor influencing the bacterial Shannon and Chao1 indices following biochar addition.

Yet, this understanding is generally constrained by the availability of fine-resolution data for multiple services across large areas and the spatial variability of land-use effects on services. We systematically surveyed published literature for New Zealand (1970-2015) to quantify the supply of 17 non-production services across 25 land covers (as a proxy for land use). We found a consistent trade-off in the services supplied by anthropogenic land covers with a high production intensity (e.g. cropping) versus those with extensive or no production. By contrast, forest cover was not associated with any distinct patterns of service supply. By drawing on existing research findings, we reveal complementarity and redundancy (potentially influencing resilience) in service supply from different land covers. This will guide practitioners in shaping land systems that sustainably support human well-being.",,,Biological Reviews,,,Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans,2021-05-24,2021,2021-05-24,2021-10,96,5,1989-2008,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Gómez‐Creutzberg, Carla; Lagisz, Malgorzata; Nakagawa, Shinichi; Brockerhoff, Eckehard G.; Tylianakis, Jason M.","Gómez‐Creutzberg, Carla (Centre for Integrative Ecology, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, 8140, New Zealand); Lagisz, Malgorzata (Evolution & Ecology Research Centre, School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, 2052, Australia); Nakagawa, Shinichi (Evolution & Ecology Research Centre, School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, 2052, Australia); Brockerhoff, Eckehard G.

Although arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been shown to regulate soil N and P losses, a comprehensive quantitative overview of their influences on the losses of these soil nutrients across global scales is currently lacking. This study used a meta-analysis of 322 observations from 36 studies to assess the effect of AMF inoculum on 11 variables related to the loss of soil N and P. We found that the presence of AMF significantly reduced soil N and P losses, with the most pronounced reduction occurring in soil NO3--N (-32%), followed by total P (-21%), available P (-16%) and N2O (-10%). However, the mitigation effects of AMF on soil N and P loss were dependent on the identity of AMF inoculum, plant type and soil biotic and abiotic factors. Generally, the mitigation effects of AMF increased with increasing AMF root colonization rate, microbial diversity of inoculants, soil organic carbon (SOC) content and experimental duration as well as with decreasing soil sand contents and soil N and P availability. Overall, this meta-analysis highlights the importance of AMF inoculation in mitigating N and P nutrient loss and environmental pollution for terrestrial ecosystem sustainability.","We thank you all the authors of the original studies involved in this meta-analysis.

Recently, soil microplastics have been extensively studied; however, high variability is observed among the research results owing to different soil properties, and the complexity of soil microplastic composition. The present study amassed the findings of 2886 experimental groups, across 38 studies from 2016 to 2022, and used meta-analysis to quantitatively analyze the differences in the effects of microplastic exposure on soil physicochemical properties and biota. The results showed that among the existing soil microplastic research, agricultural soils maintained a higher environmental exposure distribution than other environments. Microplastic fibers and fragments were the predominant shapes, indicating that the extensive use of agricultural films are the primary influencing factor of soil microplastic pollution at present. The results of the meta-analysis found that microplastic exposure had a significant negative effect on soil bulk density (lnRR = -0.04) and aggregate stability (lnRR = -0.085), indicating that microplastics may damage the integrity of soil structure or damage the soil surface. The significant changes in plant root biomass and soil phosphatase further signified the potential impact of microplastics on soil nutrient and geochemical element cycling. We further constructed species sensitivity distribution curves, revealing that invertebrates had a higher species sensitivity to microplastics, as they can pass through the gut wall of soil nematodes, causing oxidative stress and affecting gene expression. In general, soil is an interconnected complex, and microplastic exposure can directly or indirectly interact with environmental chemical processes in the soil environment, potentially harming the soil ecosystem; however, current research remains insufficient with respect to breadth and depth in terms of the comprehensive ""source-sink"" mechanism of soil microplastics, the hazard of exposure, and the overall toxic effects.","This work was supported by the Open Fund of the Key Laboratory of Coastal Zone Exploitation and Protection, Ministry of Natural Resources (2019CZEPK01), National Natural Science Foundation of China (41771243) and the National Key Researches and Development Program of China (2017YFD0800305).",,Environmental Pollution,,,Biota; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Microplastics; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Plastics; Soil; Soil Pollutants,2022-09-17,2022,2022-09-17,2022-11,313,,120183,Closed,Article,"Qiu, Yifei; Zhou, Shenglu; Zhang, Chuchu; Zhou, Yujie; Qin, Wendong","Qiu, Yifei (School of Geography and Ocean Science, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China; Key Laboratory of Coastal Zone Exploitation and Protection, Ministry of Natural Resources, Nanjing, 210024, China.); Zhou, Shenglu (School of Geography and Ocean Science, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China; Key Laboratory of Coastal Zone Exploitation and Protection, Ministry of Natural Resources, Nanjing, 210024, China.

Common strategies include liming, topsoil application, and phytoremediation. It remains unclear, however, which parameters determine the effectiveness of these varying recultivation strategies especially regarding SOC sequestration. This meta-analysis analyses the effect of varying recultivation strategies on SOC sequestration under different climate and soil conditions (pH, texture, depth) as well as in relation to time, based on 404 data entries from 51 studies. All included climatic regions recorded increases in SOC stocks, with tropical soils showing the highest potential for relative gains at up to 637%. We demonstrate that loamy soils sequester twice as much newly introduced SOC than sand. Strategy-wise, the highest mean rate of SOC sequestration is achieved by forest after topsoil application (3.9 Mg ha−1 a−1), agriculture after topsoil application (2.3 Mg ha−1 a−1), and agriculture with topsoil and fertiliser application (1.9 Mg ha−1 a−1) with a response ratio of 304%, 281%, and 218%, respectively. Soils analysed to less then 40 cm depth show higher SOC sequestration rates (< 10 cm: 0.6 Mg ha−1 a−1, < 20 cm: 1.0 Mg ha−1 a−1, and 20–40 cm: 0.4 Mg ha−1 a−1; response ratio of 123%, 68%, and 73%, respectively) than those analysed to a depth of 41–80 cm (0.1 Mg ha−1 a−1; response ratio of 6%). In terms of pH, strongly acidic soils (pH < 4.5) and alkaline conditions (pH > 7) offer the most beneficial environment for SOC sequestration at 0.4 Mg ha−1 a−1 and 0.8 Mg ha−1 a−1, respectively (185% and 273% response). Given comparable SOC sequestration potentials of forest after topsoil application, agriculture without amendments, and forest without amendments, we recommend to weigh these strategies against each other. Potentially decisive aspects are short- vs. long-term economic gains, food security concerns, and—in case of agriculture—the risk of overintensification leading to losses in SOC. Our data suggests that amendments exert considerable influence on SOC sequestration and need to be introduced under careful consideration.",,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Sustainable agriculture practices often aim to increase plant diversity. One means of doing this is through intercropping, where two or more plants are grown in the same field at the same time. Aboveground plant diversity may result in changes to the functioning of belowground microbial communities. Soil enzyme activities are frequently used as indicators of soil health and descriptors of soil nutrient cycling. While some studies have described the effect of intercropping on soil enzyme activities, results vary widely. To assess the overall effect that intercropping has on soil enzyme activities and describe the largest sources of variation, we performed a global meta-analysis of all studies found in the literature reporting enzyme activities in an intercropping system. Data were collected using exhaustive keyword searches on studies published through January 2021. We provide here a dataset of 969 observations across 100 studies. In addition to average enzyme activities in intercropping, metadata on environmental, edaphic, and agronomic properties were also collected.","This work was supported by USDA-NIFA [award number 2017-67013-26257], and the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research [award number 430834].",,Data in Brief,,,,2021-08-13,2021,2021-08-13,2021-10,38,,107284,All OA; Gold,Article,"Curtright, Andrew J.; Tiemann, Lisa K.","Curtright, Andrew J.

Grown mostly in wet and warm tropics with relatively high nitrogen (N) fertiliser input and crop residue retention, sugarcane production is a significant source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. Yet, a global evaluation of research on N2O emission from sugarcane crop is lacking. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis using data from 141 measurements compiled from 15 sugarcane field studies reported from different countries to i) quantify N2O emissions and emission factors (EFs) globally, and for tropics and sub-tropics, and ii) identify the key factors that promote N2O emission. Our analysis shows that the global mean total N2O emission from sugarcane production reached 2.26 (CI: 1.93-2.62) kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1 with an estimated EF of 1.21% (CI: 0.971-1.46%). N2O emissions increased exponentially with increase in N fertiliser rate, questioning the adequacy of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default EF value (1%) for sugarcane N2O emission estimation. Mean total N2O emissions and EFs in tropics and sub-tropics did not vary significantly. Supplementing synthetic N fertiliser (SN) with organic amendments (OA) significantly increased mean N2O emission (~1.4-fold) and EF (~2.5-fold) compared to SN. A remarkable reduction in N2O emission (38.6%) and EF (61.5%) was evident when enhanced efficiency fertilisers (EEF) replaced SN. In contrast, crop residue removal had little impact on N2O emission and EF, but both parameters showed an upward trend with irrigation and increased rainfall. Soil carbon content and pH were emerged as key regulators of sugarcane N2O emission and EF. It is concluded that global sugarcane N2O emission could be significant and that there is considerable prospect for mitigating the emission through innovative nutrient formulations and precision agriculture that help meet crop nutrient demand without compromising environmental imperatives.","This work was supported by the earmarked fund for China Agriculture Research System (CARS-17), Ministry of Education of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Agriculture; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Saccharum; Soil,2020-08-20,2020,2020-08-20,2021-01,752,,141795,Closed,Article,"Yang, Linsheng; Deng, Yan; Wang, Xiaozhong; Zhang, Wushuai; Shi, Xiaojun; Chen, Xinping; Lakshmanan, Prakash; Zhang, Fusuo","Yang, Linsheng (Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, China.); Deng, Yan (Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, China.); Wang, Xiaozhong (Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, China.); Zhang, Wushuai (Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, China.); Shi, Xiaojun (Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, China.); Chen, Xinping (Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, China.); Lakshmanan, Prakash (Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, China; Sugarcane Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanning 530007, China; Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, University of Queensland, St Lucia 4067, QLD, Australia.

The continued proliferation of publications and growth of data sets, data synthesis and meta-analysis approaches allows the application of powerful tools to such questions at ever finer scales. In this analysis, we combined a literature review and effect-size meta-analysis with two large, independent, observational databases to assess how land use and management impact SOC stocks, primarily with regards to forest land uses. We performed this work for the (Great Lakes) U.S. Lake States, which comprise 6% of the land area, but 7% of the forest and 9% of the forest SOC in the United States, as the second in a series of ecoregional SOC assessments. Most importantly, our analysis indicates that natural factors, such as soil texture and parent material, exert more control over SOC stocks than land use or management. With that for context, our analysis also indicates which natural factors most influence management impacts on SOC storage. We report an overall trend of significantly diminished topsoil SOC stocks with harvesting, consistent across all three data sets, while also demonstrating how certain sites and soils diverge from this pattern, including some that show opposite trends. Impacts of fire grossly mirror those of harvesting, with declines near the top of the profile, but potential gains at depth and no net change when considering the whole profile. Land use changes showing significant SOC impacts are limited to reforestation on barren mining substrates (large and variable gains) and conversion of native forest to cultivation (losses). We describe patterns within the observational data that reveal the physical basis for preferential land use, e.g., cultivation of soils with the most favorable physical properties, and forest plantation establishment on the most marginal soils, and use these patterns to identify management opportunities and considerations. We also qualify our results with ratings of confidence, based on their degree of support across approaches, and offer concise, defensible tactics for adapting management operations to site-specific criteria and SOC vulnerability.","L.

However, several contradictory results have been reported regarding the potential of biochar to immobilize arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), and nickel (Ni) in contaminated soils. We conducted a meta-analysis on the published papers since 2006 until 2019 to examine the effects of biochar on the chemical (im)mobilization of As, Cr, and Ni in contaminated soils and to elucidate the major factors that control their interactions with biochar in soil. We synthesized 48 individual papers comprised of a total of 9351 pairwise comparisons and used the statistical tool of Cohen's d as an appropriate effect size for the comparison between means. We found that the application of biochar often increased the As mobilization in soils. Important variables that modulated the biochar effects on As mobilization in soil were pyrolysis temperature and time (ranging between 8 and 16 times when T > 450 °C and t > 1hr), organic matter (7-16 times when SOM<3%) and further site conditions. In contrast to As, biochar efficiently immobilized Cr and Ni in contaminated soils. The extent of the Cr and Ni immobilization was determined by the feedstock (Cr: 7-18 times for agricultural residue-derived biochar; Ni: 13-32 times for woody biomass-derived biochar). Our meta-analysis provides a compilation on the potential of different types of biochar to reduce/increase the mobilization of As, Cr, and Ni in various soils and under different experimental conditions. This study provides important insights on factors that affect biochar's efficiency for the (im)mobilization of As, Cr, and Ni in contaminated soils. While biochar effectively immobilizes Cr and Ni, a proper management of As-polluted soils with pristine biochar is still challenging. This limitation might be overcome by modification of biochar surfaces to exhibit higher surface area and functionality and active sites for surface complexation with TEs.","We would like to appreciate the researchers whose has been used of their published data in this meta-analysis.

A systematic and mechanistic understanding of EA responses to HM contamination in soil is necessary for predicting the consequences for nutrient availability and the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S). In this study, a meta-analysis based on 671 observations found the activities of seven enzymes to decrease in response to soil contamination with Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu and As. HM contamination linearly reduced the activities of all enzymes in the following order: arylsulfatase > dehydrogenase > β-glucosidase > urease > acid phosphatase > alkaline phosphatase > catalase. The activities of two endoenzymes: arylsulfatase (partly as exoenzyme) and dehydrogenase were reduced by 72% and 64%, respectively. These reductions were two times greater than of exoenzymes: β-glucosidase, urease, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and catalase (partly endoenzyme). This reflects the much stronger impact of HMs on living microorganisms and their endoenzymes than on extracellular enzymes stabilized on clay minerals and organic matter. Increasing clay content weakened the negative effects of HM contamination on EAs. All negative effects of HMs on EAs decreased with soil depth because HMs remain mainly in the topsoil. EAs involved in the cycling of C and S were more affected by HMs than the enzymes associated with the cycling of N and P. Consequently, HM contamination may alter the stoichiometry of C, N, P and S released by enzymatic decomposition of organic compounds that consequently affect microbial community structure and activity.","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the CONICYT-Chile 21160049 doctoral scholarship and the FONDECYT-Chile 1170264 grant.

Optimization of N uses based on the yield has been tried a long since, however, the improvement of the state-of-the-art technologies and the stiffness of global warming need to readjust N rate. Albeit, few individual studies started to, herein attempted as a systematic review to generalize the optimal N rate that minimizes global warming potential (GWP) concurrently provides sufficient yield in the rice system. To satisfy mounted food demand with inadequate land & less environmental impact, GHGs emissions are increasingly evaluated as yield-scaled basis. This systematic review (20 published studies consisting of 21 study sites and 190 observations) aimed to test the hypothesis that the lowest yield-scaled GWP would provide the minimum GWP of CH4 and N2O emissions from rice system at near optimal yields. Results revealed that there was a strong polynomial quadratic relationship between CH4 emissions and N rate and strong positive correlation between N2O emissions and N rate. Compared to control the low N dose emitted less (23%) CH4 whereas high N dose emitted higher (63%) CH4 emission. The highest N2O emission observed at moderated N level. In total GWP, about 96% and 4%, GHG was emitted as CH4 and N2O, respectively. The mean GWP of CH4 and N2O emissions from rice was 5758 kg CO2 eq ha-1. The least yield-scaled GWP (0.7565 (kg CO2 eq. ha-1)) was recorded at 190 kg N ha-1 that provided the near utmost yield. This dose could be a suitable dose in midseason drainage managed rice systems especially in tropical and subtropical climatic conditions. This yield-scaled GWP supports the concept of win-win for food security and environmental aspects through balancing between viable rice productivity and maintaining convincing greenhouse gases.",This work was supported by Korea Research Fellowship Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (2019H1D3A1A01102761) and Basic Science Research Program through the NRF funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2015R1A6A1A03031413).,,Environmental Pollution,,,Agriculture; Global Warming; Methane; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Oryza; Soil,2020-12-24,2020,2020-12-24,2021-02,271,,116386,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Islam Bhuiyan, Mohammad Saiful; Rahman, Azizur; Kim, Gil Won; Das, Suvendu; Kim, Pil Joo","Islam Bhuiyan, Mohammad Saiful (Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 660-701, South Korea; Department of Soil Science, Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh.); Rahman, Azizur (School of Computing and Mathematics, Charles Sturt University, Wagg Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia.); Kim, Gil Won (Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 660-701, South Korea.); Das, Suvendu (Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 660-701, South Korea.); Kim, Pil Joo (Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 660-701, South Korea; Division of Applied Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 660-701, South Korea.

Unlike other CDR technologies, biochar is expected to deliver various valuable effects in e.g. agriculture, animal husbandry, industrial processes, remediation activities and waste management. The diversity of biochar side effects to CDR makes the systematic environmental assessment of biochar projects challenging, and to date, there is no common framework for evaluating them. Our aim is to bridge the methodology gap for evaluating biochar systems from a life-cycle perspective. Using life cycle theory, actual biochar projects, and reviews of biochar research, we propose a general description of biochar systems, an overview of biochar effects, and an evaluation framework for biochar effects. The evaluation framework was applied to a case study, the Stockholm Biochar Project. In the framework, biochar effects are classified according to life cycle stage and life cycle effect type; and the biochar's end-of-life and the reference situations are made explicit. Three types of effects are easily included in life cycle theory: changes in biosphere exchanges, technosphere inputs, and technosphere outputs. For other effects, analysing the cause-effect chain may be helpful. Several biochar effects in agroecosystems can be modelled as future productivity increases against a reference situation. In practice, the complexity of agroecosystems can be bypassed by using empirical models. Existing biochar life cycle studies are often limited to carbon footprint calculations and quantify a limited amount of biochar effects, mainly carbon sequestration, energy displacements and fertiliser-related emissions. The methodological development in this study can be of benefit to the biochar and CDR research communities, as well as decision-makers in biochar practice and policy.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,This research was funded by the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (Vinnova) under project number 2016–03392.,Journal of Environmental Management,,,Agriculture; Carbon Sequestration; Charcoal; Soil,2021-02-17,2021,2021-02-17,2021-05,286,,112154,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Azzi, Elias S; Karltun, Erik; Sundberg, Cecilia","Azzi, Elias S (Department of Sustainable Development, Environmental Engineering, and Sciences (SEED), KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.

We conducted a meta-analysis to clarify the effect of biochar addition on soil bacterial and fungal diversity with an increase in Shannon or Chao1 index as the outcome. Different experimental setups, quantitative levels of biochar addition, various biochar source materials and preparation temperatures, and the effect of natural precipitation in field experiments were the investigated variables. From a total of 95 publications identified for analysis, 384 datasets for Shannon index and 277 datasets for Chao1 index were extracted that described the bacterial diversity in the soils, of which field experiments and locations in China dominated. The application of biochar in soil significantly increased the diversity of soil bacteria but it had no significant effect on the diversity of fungi. Of the different experimental setups, the largest increase in bacterial diversity was seen for field experiments, followed by pot experiments, but laboratory and greenhouse settings did not report a significant increase. In field experiments, natural precipitation had a strong effect, and biochar increased bacterial diversity most in humid conditions (mean annual precipitation, MAP > 800 mm), followed by semi-arid conditions (MAP 200-400 mm). Biochar prepared from herbaceous materials was more effective to increase bacterial diversity than other raw materials and the optimal pyrolysis temperature was 350-550 °C. Addition of biochar at various levels produced inconclusive data for Chao1 and Shannon indices, and its effect was less strong than that of the other assessed variables.",,This work was funded by the Natural Sciences Foundation of Heilongjiang Province (LH2020C088); the Heilongjiang Province Postdoctoral Research Start-up Fund Project (LBH-Q21167); the Outstanding Youth Foundation of Heilongjiang University (JCL202006); Heilongjiang Provincial Ecological Environmental Protection Research Project; Basic Scientific Research project of Higher Education Institutions of Heilongjiang Province and the China Scholarship Council Visiting Scholar Program (201908230401).,Microorganisms,,Elisa Gamalero,,2023-03-02,2023,2023-03-02,,11,3,641,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wang, Mingyu; Yu, Xiaoying; Weng, Xiaohong; Zeng, Xiannan; Li, Mengsha; Sui, Xin","Wang, Mingyu (Engineering Research Center of Agricultural Microbiology Technology, Ministry of Education & Heilongjiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Ecological Restoration and Resource Utilization for Cold Region & Key Laboratory of Microbiology, College of Heilongjiang Province & School of Life Sciences, Heilongjiang University, Harbin 150080, China.); Yu, Xiaoying (Engineering Research Center of Agricultural Microbiology Technology, Ministry of Education & Heilongjiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Ecological Restoration and Resource Utilization for Cold Region & Key Laboratory of Microbiology, College of Heilongjiang Province & School of Life Sciences, Heilongjiang University, Harbin 150080, China.); Weng, Xiaohong (Engineering Research Center of Agricultural Microbiology Technology, Ministry of Education & Heilongjiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Ecological Restoration and Resource Utilization for Cold Region & Key Laboratory of Microbiology, College of Heilongjiang Province & School of Life Sciences, Heilongjiang University, Harbin 150080, China.); Zeng, Xiannan (Institute of Crop Cultivation and Tillage, Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150088, China.); Li, Mengsha (Institute of Nature and Ecology, Heilongjiang Academy of Sciences, Harbin 150040, China.); Sui, Xin (Engineering Research Center of Agricultural Microbiology Technology, Ministry of Education & Heilongjiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Ecological Restoration and Resource Utilization for Cold Region & Key Laboratory of Microbiology, College of Heilongjiang Province & School of Life Sciences, Heilongjiang University, Harbin 150080, China.)","Li, Mengsha (Heilongjiang Academy of Sciences); Sui, Xin (Heilongjiang University)","Wang, Mingyu (Heilongjiang University); Yu, Xiaoying (Heilongjiang University); Weng, Xiaohong (Heilongjiang University); Zeng, Xiannan (Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences); Li, Mengsha (Heilongjiang Academy of Sciences); Sui, Xin (Heilongjiang University)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/11/3/641/pdf?version=1677754515,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155943854,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,

Yet, a systematic and quantitative analysis on how CRU affects staple crop production including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and rice (Oryza sativa L.) is lacking. Here, a meta-analysis was conducted to determine how CRU influences soil chemical properties, total nitrogen (TN) uptake, grain yield, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of staple crop in China. The results indicated that CRU application significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC), TN, and available nitrogen (AN) by 5.93%, 3.89% and 13.98% respectively overall, while soil pH showed no significant changes. Compared to the application of CU, applying CRU significantly increased grain yield by 7.23%, which was mainly owing to the higher TN uptake (9.13%) across all the studies. In addition, the application of CRU significantly increased NUE, nitrogen agronomy efficiency (NAE), utilization rate of nitrogen fertilizer (NUR), and nitrogen physiological efficiency (NPE) by an average of 23.4%, 34.65%, 25.83% and 15.8% respectively which could be attributed to the slow nitrogen (N) release characteristics of CRU. The positive effect of CRU on grain yield and NUE of staple crop was greatest when the content of SOC and TN were extremely low, indicating that it was most effective to improve grain production of infertile soil by applying CRU. The finding of this study indicated that the application of CRU should be promoted for grain production, especially for infertile soil.","The funding of this study was The National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0201201).

Maximizing crop yields often results in a system where most benefits accrue to very few (in the form of profits), alongside irreparable environmental harm to agricultural ecosystems, landscapes, and people. Here, we present evidence that an un-yielding, which we define as de-emphasizing the importance of yields alone, is necessary to achieve the goal of a more Food secure, Agrobiodiverse, Regenerative, Equitable and just (FARE) agriculture. Focusing on yields places the emphasis on one particular outcome of agriculture, which is only an intermediate means to the true endpoint of human well-being. Using yields as a placeholder for this outcome ignores the many other benefits of agriculture that people also care about, like health, livelihoods, and a sense of place. Shifting the emphasis to these multiple benefits rather than merely yields, and to their equitable delivery to all people, we find clear scientific evidence of win-wins for people and nature through four strategies that foster FARE agriculture: reduced disturbance, systems reintegration, diversity, and justice (in the form of securing rights to land and other resources). Through a broad review of the current state of agriculture, desired futures, and the possible pathways to reach them, we argue that while trade-offs between some ecosystem services in agriculture are unavoidable, the same need not be true of the end benefits we desire from them.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to Dan Jaffee, Nathan McClintock, and Colin Anderson for their recommendations and expert guidance in the food and agriculture justice literature.

Minimizing AFOLU sector GHG emissions in Africa is notoriously hard because of difficulties in emission estimation, the disperse nature of AFOLU emissions, and the complex links between AFOLU activities and poverty reduction. Yet, there are very few systematic reviews dealing with decarbonization pathways for the AFOLU sector in Africa. This article explores the options for achieving deep decarbonization of AFOLU sector in Africa, through a systematic review.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis and provide insight into what types of nutrients and pollutants seabirds are transporting, the influence these subsidies are having on recipient environments, with a particular focus on soil, and what may happen if seabird populations decline. The addition of guano to colony soils increased nutrient levels compared to control soils for all seabirds studied, with cascading positive effects observed across a range of habitats. Deposited guano sometimes led to negative impacts, such as guanotrophication, or guano-induced eutrophication, which was often observed where there was an excess of guano or in areas with high seabird densities. While the literature describing nutrients transported by seabirds is extensive, literature regarding pollutant transfer is comparatively limited, with a focus on toxic and bioaccumulative metals. Research on persistent organic pollutants and plastics transported by seabirds is likely to increase in coming years. Studies were limited geographically, with hotspots of research activity in a few locations, but data were lacking from large regions around the world. Studies were also limited to seabird species listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. As seabird populations are impacted by multiple threats and steep declines have been observed for many species world-wide, gaps in the literature are particularly concerning. The loss of seabirds will impact nutrient cycling at localized levels and potentially on a global scale as well, yet it is unknown what may truly happen to areas that rely on seabirds if these populations disappear.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors acknowledge the traditional owners of the lands where this research was completed.

However, it remains challenging to evaluate and predict their effect on removing soil organic pollutants based on earthworm toxicology and pollutant degradation rates. Peer-reviewed journal articles on ecotoxicology and bioremediation from the years 1974-2020 (cutoff date September 2020) were selected for meta-analysis to quantify the effect size of earthworms on organic pollutant degradation. The meta-analysis shows that the average effect size of earthworms on organic pollutant degradation is 128.5% (p < 0.05). Soils with high soil organic matter or clay textures are more conducive to earthworm-mediated removal of organic pollutants. Structural equation modeling reveals that earthworms' sensitivity to contaminant exposure may be a greater limiting factor on pollutant degradation than environmental factors. In addition, the quantitative relationship existed between LC50 and the pollutants' degradation that an elevated LC50 threshold resulted in at least 1.5 times increase in the pollutants' degradation size. This correlation was dually confirmed via meta-analysis and the validation trial. The results of this study contribute to a more profound understanding of the potential to use earthworms to mitigate organic pollution in soils and develop earthworm-based soil remediation techniques on a global scale.","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41771350 and 42077106), and the Young Elite Scientists Sponsors Hip Program by CAST (2018QNRC001).",,Journal of Hazardous Materials,,,"Animals; Biodegradation, Environmental; Environmental Pollutants; Oligochaeta; Soil; Soil Pollutants",2022-01-22,2022,2022-01-22,2022-05,429,,128286,Closed,Article,"Chao, Huizhen; Sun, Mingming; Wu, Yunling; Xia, Rong; Yuan, Shujian; Hu, Feng","Chao, Huizhen (Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Science, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.); Sun, Mingming (Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Science, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China; Key Laboratory of Plant Immunity, Jiangsu Collaborative Center for Solid Organic Waste Resource Utilization, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.

Many cross-site studies have found that SOC-poor soils tend to gain or retain carbon more readily than SOC-rich soils. While this pattern may partly reflect reality, here we argue that it can also be created by a pair of statistical artifacts. First, soils that appear SOC-poor purely due to random variation will tend to yield more moderate SOC estimates upon resampling and hence will appear to accrue or retain more SOC than SOC-rich soils. This phenomenon is an example of regression to the mean. Second, normalized metrics of SOC change-such as relative rates and response ratios-will by definition show larger changes in SOC at lower initial SOC levels, even when the absolute change in SOC does not depend on initial SOC. These two artifacts create an exaggerated impression that initial SOC stocks are a major control on SOC dynamics. To address this problem, we recommend applying statistical corrections to eliminate the effect of regression to the mean, and avoiding normalized metrics when testing relationships between SOC change and initial SOC. Careful consideration of these issues in future cross-site studies will support clearer scientific inference that can better inform environmental management.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory&#x27;s Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LLNL‐LDRD) program grant #19‐ERD‐010 to E.E.N. and the LLNL “Carbon Initiative,” with additional support provided from a U.S. Department of Energy Early Career Award to E.E.N.

Tillage can affect a variety of soil-mediated processes, e.g., soil carbon sequestration (SCS) or depletion, greenhouse gas (GHG) (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emission, and water pollution. Several tillage practices are in vogue globally, and they exhibit varied impacts on these processes. Hence, there is a dire need to synthesize, collate and comprehensively present these interlinked phenomena to facilitate future researches. This study deals with the co-benefits and trade-offs produced by several tillage practices on SCS and related soil properties, GHG emissions, and water quality. We hypothesized that improved tillage practices could enable agriculture to contribute to SCS and mitigate GHG emissions and leaching of nutrients and pesticides. Based on our current understanding, we conclude that sustainable soil moisture level and soil temperature management is crucial under different tillage practices to offset leaching loss of soil stored nutrients/pesticides, GHG emissions and ensuring SCS. For instance, higher carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) could be attributed to the fluctuations in soil moisture and temperature regimes. In addition, NT may enhance nitrate (NO3-) leaching over CT because of improved soil structure, infiltration capacity, and greater water flux, however, suggesting that the eutrophication potential of NT is high. Our study indicates that the evaluation of the eutrophication potential of different tillage practices is still overlooked. Our study suggests that improving tillage practices in terms of mitigation of N2O emission and preventing NO3- pollution may be sustainable if nitrification inhibitors are applied.","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT) Mexico is thankfully acknowledged for partially supporting this work under Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (SNI) program awarded to Elda M.

A global meta-analysis,"Cadmium (Cd) poses great threats to human health as a major contaminant in agricultural soil. Biochar shows great potential in the remediation of agricultural soil. However, it remains unclear whether the remediation effect of biochar on Cd pollution is affected by various cropping systems. Here, this study used 2007 paired observations from 227 peer-reviewed articles and employed hierarchical meta-analysis to investigate the response of three types of cropping systems to the remediation of Cd pollution by using biochar. As a result, biochar application significantly reduced the Cd content in soil, plant roots and edible parts of various cropping systems. The decrease in Cd level ranged from 24.9% to 45.0%. The feedstock, application rate, and pH of biochar as well as soil pH and cation exchange capacity were dominant factors for Cd remediation effect of biochar, and their relative importance all exceeded 37.4%. Lignocellulosic and herbal biochar were found to be suitable for all cropping systems, while the effects of manure, wood and biomass biochar were limited in cereal cropping systems. Furthermore, biochar exhibited a more long-lasting remediation effect on paddy soils than on dryland.

Firstly, we conducted a systematic analysis of the literature on the topic of nitrogen deposition impacts over the past 30 years using a bibliometric analysis. A systematic review of the global research status, publication patterns, research hotspots and important literature. We found a large number of publications in the Chinese region, and mainly focuses on the field of microorganisms. Secondly, we used a meta-analysis to focus on microbial changes using the Chinese grassland ecosystem as an example. The results show that the research on nitrogen deposition in grassland ecosystems shows an exponential development trend, and the authors and research institutions of the publications are mainly concentrated in China, North America, and Western Europe. The keyword clustering results showed 11 important themes labeled climate change, elevated CO2, species richness and diversity, etc. in these studies. The burst keyword analysis indicated that temperature sensitivity, microbial communities, etc. are the key research directions. The results of the meta-analysis found that nitrogen addition decreased soil microbial diversity, and different ecosystems may respond differently. Treatment time, nitrogen addition rate, external environmental conditions, and pH had major effects on microbial alpha diversity and biomass. The loss of microbial diversity and the reduction of biomass with nitrogen fertilizer addition will alter ecosystem functioning, with dramatic impacts on global climate change.

However, there are still uncertainties regarding the substitution of mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer with manure in terms of its effects on crop yield and Nr losses. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of wheat, maize, and rice applications in China and discovered that substituting mineral N fertilizer with manure increased wheat and maize yields by 4.9 and 5.5 %, respectively, but decreased rice yield by 1.7 %. The increase of yield is larger at low N application and low mineral N substitution rates ((SR) ≤30 %) for silt soils, warm regions, and acidic soils. High SR (>70 %) decreased rice yield as well as the N use efficiency of wheat and maize. Substitution of mineral N fertilizer with manure resulted in lower NH3 volatilization for wheat (48.7 %), lower N2O and NH3 emissions, and N runoff for maize (12.8, 49.6, and 66.7 %, respectively), and lower total Nr losses for rice (11.3-26.5 %). The loss of Nr was significantly and negatively correlated with soil organic carbon content. The rate of N application, soil properties, and climate were critical factors influencing N2O and NH3 emissions and N leaching, whereas climate or soil properties were the dominant factors influencing response in N runoff. We concluded that in silt soils, warm regions, and neutral soils, a ≤ 50 % substitution of mineral N fertilizer with manure can sustain crop yields while mitigating Nr losses.","This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFD1700900, 2021YFD1901205), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42175137, 42177341), the BBSRC (BBS/E/C/00010320), the Natural Environment Research Council (NE/S009094/1), and the High-level Team Project of China Agricultural University.",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,"Agriculture; Animals; Carbon; China; Crops, Agricultural; Fertilizers; Manure; Nitrogen; Oryza; Soil; Triticum; Zea mays",2022-08-15,2022,2022-08-15,2022-12,850,,158064,Closed,Article,"Ren, Fengling; Sun, Nan; Misselbrook, Tom; Wu, Lianhai; Xu, Minggang; Zhang, Fusuo; Xu, Wen","Ren, Fengling (College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, National Academy of Agriculture Green Development, Key Laboratory of Plant-Soil Interactions, Ministry of Education, National Observation and Research Station of Agriculture Green Development (Quzhou, Hebei), China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China; Key Laboratory of Arable Land Quality Monitoring and Evaluation, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.); Sun, Nan (Key Laboratory of Arable Land Quality Monitoring and Evaluation, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.); Misselbrook, Tom (Sustainable Agriculture Sciences, Rothamsted Research, North Wyke, Okehampton, Devon EX20 2SB, UK.); Wu, Lianhai (Sustainable Agriculture Sciences, Rothamsted Research, North Wyke, Okehampton, Devon EX20 2SB, UK.); Xu, Minggang (Key Laboratory of Arable Land Quality Monitoring and Evaluation, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.

In addition to its benefits, it can be a way to transfer pollutants such as potentially harmful elements (PHEs) to the human food chain. Many studies have been conducted for this purpose on various vegetables; however, no comprehensive study has been performed on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.). In this respect, the study was aimed to meta-analyze the PHEs concentration in the edible part of lettuce and coriander vegetables irrigated by wastewater. Carcinogenic risk (CR) and noncarcinogenic risk (non-CR) assessments were also done for consumers. After reviewing 32 included articles (41 studies), the rank order of the PHEs in lettuce was obtained as Fe (194.76 mg/kg) > Zn (133.47 mg/kg) > Cu (55.70 mg/kg) > Ni (26.96 mg/kg) > Pb (12.80 mg/kg) > Cr (9.68 mg/kg) Cd (8.24 mg/kg) > As (1.13 mg/kg) and for coriander Fe (1056 mg/kg) > Zn (79.80 mg/kg) > Cr (28.34 mg/kg) > Ni (24.71 mg/kg) > Cu (17.46 mg/kg) > Pb (13.23 mg/kg) > Cd (2.23 mg/kg). Total target hazard quotient (TTHQ) for adults in all countries except UAE, France, and Kenya and for children all countries except Kenya was more than 1 value. The carcinogenic risk for adult groups in Nigeria, France, China, and Iran countries was not acceptable (CR > 1E-4).

However, previous studies on the effects of atrazine on soil microorganisms have yielded highly variable results. Therefore, a meta-analysis using a database containing 1141 data points from 39 peer-reviewed papers was conducted to illustrate the response of soil microorganisms to the application of atrazine. The results showed that the application of atrazine significantly increased soil microbial biomass and respiration by 8.9% and 26.77%, respectively, and decreased soil microbial diversity and enzyme activity by 4.87% and 24.04%, respectively. In addition, mixed-effect models were used to explain the influence of moderator variables, including water holding capacity, temperature, pH, organic carbon content, atrazine concentration, duration, and soil texture, on the results to help account for inconsistent conclusions. It was found that soil microbial biomass was significantly positively correlated with temperature, organic carbon content, atrazine concentration, clay content and silt content, while it was negatively correlated with pH and sand content. Soil microbial respiration was negatively correlated with pH and positively correlated with atrazine concentration. Soil microbial diversity was positively correlated with water holding capacity, pH, silt content and sand content, and negatively correlated with organic carbon content and clay content. Soil enzyme activity, the indicator that showed the largest decrease after atrazine application, was significantly positively correlated with water holding capacity, temperature, organic carbon content, and herbicide concentration; it was negatively correlated with soil pH. On the basis of these analysis results, we recommend that atrazine should not be allowed to persist in alkaline sandy soil for long periods of time, as this can result in atrazine having a significant negative impact on soil microorganisms.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, our current understanding on the impacts of nanoplastics upon terrestrial plants is fragmented. The lack of systematic approaches to evaluating these impacts limits our ability to generalize from existing studies and perpetuates regulatory barriers. Here, we undertook a meta-analysis to quantify the overall strength of nanoplastic impacts upon terrestrial plants and developed a machine learning approach to predict adverse impacts and identify contributing features. We show that adverse impacts are primarily associated with toxicity metrics, followed by plant species, nanoplastic mass concentration and size, and exposure time and medium. These results highlight that the threats of nanoplastics depend on a diversity of reactions across molecular to ecosystem scales. These reactions are rooted in both the spatial and functional complexities of nanoplastics and, as such, are specific to both the plastic characteristics and environmental conditions. These findings demonstrate the utility of interrogating the diversity of toxicity data in the literature to update both risk assessments and evidence-based policy actions.","This study was financially supported by the Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS (2020314), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41977355), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20220092), and USDA Hatch program (MAS 00549).",,ACS Nano,,,"Microplastics; Ecosystem; Plastics; Water Pollutants, Chemical",2022-10-06,2022,2022-10-06,2022-10-25,16,10,17157-17167,Closed,Article,"Dang, Fei; Wang, Qingyu; Yan, Xiliang; Zhang, Yuanye; Yan, Jiachen; Zhong, Huan; Zhou, Dongmei; Luo, Yongming; Zhu, Yong-Guan; Xing, Baoshan; Wang, Yujun","Dang, Fei (Key Laboratory of Soil Environment and Pollution Remediation, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, P.R.

Here, we applied meta-analysis to identify the occurrence status, pollution sources, and environmental risk of COPs from 246 peer-published literature, including 25 kinds of COPs from 977 sites. The results showed that the median concentrations of COPs were at the ng g-1 level. By the combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and positive matrix factorization (PMF), we established 7 pollution sources for COPs. Environmental risk assessment found 73.3% of selected sites were at a security level but the rest were not, especially for the wetlands. The environmental risk of COPs was usually underestimated by the existing evaluation methods, such as without the consideration of the non-extractable residues (NER) and the multi-process coupling effect. Especially, the synergetic coupling associations between dechlorination and methanogenesis might increase the risk of methane emission that has barely been previously considered in previous risk assessment approaches. Our results expanded the knowledge for the pollution control and remediation of COPs in anaerobic environments.","The whole research was jointly supported by the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LD21D030001), National Natural Science Foundation of China (42225705, 42177006, 41721001), and China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MAR (CARS-04).",,Environmental Pollution,,,Environmental Pollutants; Soil; Environmental Pollution; Risk Assessment; Wetlands; Soil Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring,2023-02-11,2023,2023-02-11,2023-04,323,,121270,Closed,Article,"Liu, Meng; Yuan, Jing; Shi, Jiachun; Xu, Jianming; He, Yan","Liu, Meng (Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Institute of Soil and Water Resources and Environmental Science, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.); Yuan, Jing (Microbiome Network and Department of Agricultural Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, 80524, USA.); Shi, Jiachun (Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Institute of Soil and Water Resources and Environmental Science, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.

Mangrove forests, saltmarshes and seagrass meadows, referred to as blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), are hotspots of atmospheric CO2 storage due to their capacity to sequester carbon at a far higher rate than terrestrial forests. Despite increased effort to understand the mechanisms underpinning blue carbon fluxes, there has been little synthesis of how management activities influence carbon stocks and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in BCEs. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of 111 studies that measured how carbon stocks and GHG fluxes in BCEs respond to various coastal management strategies. Research effort has focused mainly on restoration approaches, which resulted in significant increases in blue carbon after 4 years compared to degraded sites, and the potential to reach parity with natural sites after 7-17 years. Lesser studied management alternatives, such as sediment manipulation and altered hydrology, showed only increases in biomass and weaker responses for soil carbon stocks and sequestration. The response of GHG emissions to management was complex, with managed sites emitting less than natural reference sites but emitting more compared to degraded sites. Individual GHGs also differed in their responses to management. To date, blue carbon management studies are underrepresented in the southern hemisphere and are usually limited in duration (61% of studies <3 years duration). Our meta-analysis describes the current state of blue carbon management from the available data and highlights recommendations for prioritizing conservation management, extending monitoring time frames of BCE carbon stocks, improving our understanding of GHG fluxes in open coastal systems and redistributing management and research effort into understudied, high-risk areas.",We thank Mischa Turschwell for creating the world map figure.

They are known for improving the quality of coastal water and provisioning coastal fisheries. However, this ecosystem is under potential threat due to urban coastal land reclamation, limited sediment supply, increased nutrient/eutrophication, and sea level rise. Therefore, restoration efforts to protect the degraded salt marsh habitat are considerably increasing worldwide. In this paper, we present an overview of salt marsh restoration techniques and success indicators. Published scientific literature in English language was collected by searching the most relevant keywords from popular search engines, namely, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Mendeley to get the information about salt marsh restoration techniques and success indicators. This study comprehensively reviewed data from 78 peer-reviewed papers. Results indicated that much of the salt marsh was restored through assisted abiotic strategies (e.g., recovery of tidal exchange, managed realignment, and sediment level amendment). A total of 214 indicators were found, spanning over six major ecological attributes such as structural diversity, ecosystem functions, physical conditions, species composition, external exchange, and absence of threat. Author keywords analysis revealed several hotspots for recent research (e.g., 16 s rRNA, fungi, microbial communities, carbon accumulation, and blue carbon). This paper proposes a model for restoring degraded salt marsh, as well as tracking their success. The information presented here will assist the marine ecosystem restoration practitioners in getting a comprehensive understanding of salt marsh restoration success evaluation.","We are grateful to Professor Laura Airoldi for critically reading an earlier draft of this manuscript.

Due to the regular influx of pollutants, CWs can release considerable quantities of greenhouse gases (GHGs), ammonia (NH3), and other atmospheric pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), etc., which will aggravate global warming, degrade air quality and even threaten human health. However, there is a lack of systematic understanding of factors affecting the emission of these gases in CWs. In this study, we applied meta-analysis to quantitatively review the main influencing factors of GHG emission from CWs; meanwhile, the emissions of NH3, VOCs, and H2S were qualitatively assessed. Meta-analysis indicates that horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) CWs emit less CH4 and N2O than free water surface flow (FWS) CWs. The addition of biochar can mitigate N2O emission compared to gravel-based CWs but has the risk of increasing CH4 emission. Polyculture CWs stimulate CH4 emission but pose no influence on N2O emission compared to monoculture CWs. The influent wastewater characteristics (e.g., C/N ratio, salinity) and environmental conditions (e.g., temperature) can also impact GHG emission. The NH3 volatilization from CWs is positively related to the influent nitrogen concentration and pH value. High plant species richness tends to reduce NH3 volatilization and plant composition showed greater effects than species richness. Though VOCs and H2S emissions from CWs do not always occur, it should be a concern when using CWs to treat wastewater containing hydrocarbon and acid. This study provides solid references for simultaneously achieving pollutant removal and reducing gaseous emission from CWs, which avoids the transformation of water pollution into air contamination.",,"This work was supported by CAS Interdisciplinary Innovation Team Project (No. JCTD-2020-14), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA28040102), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U21A2037), and Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS (No. Y2021068).",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Humans; Gases; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Wastewater; Wetlands,2023-02-22,2023,2023-02-22,,20,5,3876,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hu, Sile; Zhu, Hui; Bañuelos, Gary; Shutes, Brian; Wang, Xinyi; Hou, Shengnan; Yan, Baixing","Hu, Sile (Key Laboratory of Wetland Ecology and Environment, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun 130102, China.; College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.); Zhu, Hui (Key Laboratory of Wetland Ecology and Environment, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun 130102, China.); Bañuelos, Gary (USDA, Agricultural Research Service, San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Science Center, 9611 South Riverbend Avenue, Parlier, CA 93648-9757, USA.); Shutes, Brian (Department of Natural Sciences, Middlesex University, Hendon, London NW4 4BT, UK.); Wang, Xinyi (Key Laboratory of Wetland Ecology and Environment, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun 130102, China.; College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.); Hou, Shengnan (Key Laboratory of Wetland Ecology and Environment, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun 130102, China.); Yan, Baixing (Key Laboratory of Wetland Ecology and Environment, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun 130102, China.)","Zhu, Hui (Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology); Hou, Shengnan (Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology)","Hu, Sile (Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Zhu, Hui (Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology); Bañuelos, Gary (San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Sciences Center); Shutes, Brian (Middlesex University); Wang, Xinyi (Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Hou, Shengnan (Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology); Yan, Baixing (Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/5/3876/pdf?version=1677052939,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155661969,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,13 Climate Action; 14 Life Below Water

However, how the coupling responds to global change has not yet been examined. Through a comprehensive and systematic literature review, we assessed how the dynamics of carbon processes change with increasing nitrogen input and how nitrogen processes change with increasing carbon input under global change. Our review shows that nitrogen input to the ecosystem mostly stimulates plant primary productivity but inconsistently decreases microbial activities or increases soil carbon sequestration, with nitrogen leaching and nitrogenous gas emission rapidly increasing. Nitrogen fixation increases and nitrogen leaching decreases to improve soil nitrogen availability and support plant growth and ecosystem carbon sequestration under elevated CO2 and temperature or along ecosystem succession. We conclude that soil nitrogen cycle processes continually adjust to change in response to either overload under nitrogen addition or deficiency under CO2 enrichment and ecosystem succession to couple with carbon cycling. Indeed, processes of both carbon and nitrogen cycles continually adjust under global change, leading to dynamic coupling in carbon and nitrogen cycles. The dynamic coupling framework reconciles previous debates on the “uncoupling” or “decoupling” of ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycles under global change. Ecosystem models failing to simulate these dynamic adjustments cannot simulate carbon-nitrogen coupling nor predict ecosystem carbon sequestration well.",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31988102) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFF0802102).,,Science China Life Sciences,,,Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Soil Microbiology; Soil,2023-01-18,2023,2023-01-18,2023-04,66,4,771-782,Closed,Article,"Niu, Shuli; Song, Lei; Wang, Jinsong; Luo, Yiqi; Yu, Guirui","Niu, Shuli (Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modelling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100101, Beijing, China; College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100049, Beijing, China); Song, Lei (Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modelling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100101, Beijing, China; College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100049, Beijing, China); Wang, Jinsong (Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modelling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100101, Beijing, China); Luo, Yiqi (Center for Ecosystem Science and Society, Department of Biological Sciences, Northern Arizona University, 86011, Flagstaff, AZ, USA); Yu, Guirui (Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modelling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100101, Beijing, China; College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100049, Beijing, China)","Niu, Shuli (Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences)","Niu, Shuli (Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Song, Lei (Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Wang, Jinsong (Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research); Luo, Yiqi (Northern Arizona University); Yu, Guirui (Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences)",5,5,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154740872,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,15 Life on Land

However, the use of drip irrigation to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2 O) emissions in agricultural systems globally is uncertain. Here, we performed a global meta-analysis of 485 field measurements of N2 O emissions from 74 peer-reviewed publications prior to March 2021, to quantify the fertilizer-induced N2 O emission factor (EF) of drip irrigation and examine the influencing factors of climate, crop, soil properties, and source and rate of fertilizer N application. The results showed that drip irrigation reduced (p < 0.05) N2 O emissions by 32% and 46% compared to furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems, respectively. The overall average EF with drip irrigation was 0.35%, being two-thirds lower than the IPCC Tier I default value of 1% (kg N2 O-N/kg added fertilizer N). The EF was not significantly affected by climate, crop, soil texture, soil organic carbon content, and pH. The EF was also not significantly (p > 0.05) affected by synthetic N fertilizer source despite a lower numerical value with enhanced efficiency than conventional fertilizers. The EF increased significantly (p < 0.001) with N addition rate in a binomial distribution. Using the IPCC default EF overestimated N2 O emissions inventories for drip-irrigated cropping systems by 7614 and 13,091 Mg per year for China and the globe, respectively. These results indicate that drip irrigation should be recommended as an essential N2 O mitigation strategy for irrigated crop production.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31870499), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2019M660495), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (BLX201904).

At present, it is still unclear which factors are responsible for the SOC stock dynamics. Therefore, we analyzed the relationship between SOC stock changes and site characteristics, soil properties, experiment characteristics and manure characteristics. Overall, we included 101 studies with a total of 592 treatments. On average, the application of manure on agricultural soils increased SOC stocks by 35.4%, corresponding to 10.7 Mg ha−1. Manure applications in conventional tillage systems led to higher SOC stocks (+ 2.2 Mg ha−1) than applications under reduced tillage. Soil organic carbon increase upon manure application was higher in soils under non-tropical climate conditions (+ 2.7 Mg ha−1) compared to soils under sub-tropical climate. Larger SOC increases after manure application were achieved in intermediate and shallow topsoils (in 0–15 cm by 9.5 Mg ha−1 and in 16–20 cm by 13.6 Mg ha−1), but SOC stocks were also increased in deeper soils (> 20 cm 4.6 Mg ha−1), regardless of the tillage intensity. The highest relative SOC increase (+ 48%) was achieved if the initial SOC was below 1% but the absolute SOC increased with increasing initial SOC. Clay soils showed higher SOC increase rates compared to sandy soils (+ 3.1 Mg ha−1). Acidic soils showed comparable relative effects but a higher stock difference than neutral (+ 5.1 Mg ha−1) and alkaline soils (+ 5.1 Mg ha−1). The application of farmyard-, cattle- and pig manure showed the highest SOC increases (50%, 32% and 41%, respectively), while green manure and straw showed only minor effects. If manure applications were combined with additional mineral fertilizer, the SOC increases were higher (+ 1.7 Mg ha−1) compared to manure alone. Higher applied amounts generally led to higher SOC stocks. However the annually applied amount is only important under conventional tillage, non-tropical climate conditions, and pH-neutral as well as SOC-rich or SOC-depleted soils and if no additional mineral fertilization is applied. Further studies should focus on the SOC dynamics under tropical climate conditions and factors influencing a potential carbon saturation. In both cases, the number of data was too small. For this reason, additional field studies should be conducted primarily in the tropics. On the other hand, long-term field trials should be re-assessed or newly established to specifically investigate potential saturation effects and long-term (> 20 years) fertilizer effects and carbon sequestration.",We thank Lukas Albrecht who helped preparing the figures.

However, how P enrichment affects soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of 642 SOC observations from 213 field P addition experiments world-wide and explored the regulations of plant inputs, microbial outputs, plant characteristics, and environmental and experimental factors on SOC responses. We found that, globally, P addition stimulated SOC by 4.0% (95% CI: 2.0-6.0%), but the stimulation only occurred in forest and cropland rather than in grassland. Across sites, the response of SOC correlated with that of plant aboveground rather than belowground biomass, suggesting that the change in plant inputs from aboveground was more important than that from belowground in regulating SOC changes due to P addition. Among multiple factors, plant N fixation status and mean annual temperature were the best predictors for SOC responses to P addition, with SOC stimulation being higher in ecosystems dominated by symbiotic nitrogen fixers and ecosystems in high-temperature regions like tropical forests. Our findings highlight the differential and ecosystem-dependent responses of SOC to P enrichment and can contribute to accurate predictions of soil carbon dynamics in a P-enriched world.","Acknowledgements This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31988102, 42141006 and 32201395) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2021M700228 and 2022T150015).

Based on 126 studies conducted in China between 1996 and 2018, using meta-analysis in combination with decision regression tree modeling and life cycle assessment (LCA), this study aimed to (1) quantify the effect of water and N input on wheat yield, water productivity (WP c ), and N use efficiency (NUE f ), and evaluate the subsequent environmental impact in different regions using LCA; and (2) evaluate, model, and rank the roles of environmental (e.g., soil nutrient status and climatic factors) and agronomic factors (e.g., water and N management practices) affecting wheat yield, WP c , and NUE f . The results showed that irrigation and N addition increased the average yield and WP c by 40 and 15%, respectively, relative to control treatments with no irrigation or fertilizer application. The mean water saving potential (WSP) and N saving potential (NSP) in China were estimated at 11 and 10%, respectively. Soil nutrient status [e.g., initial soil phosphorus (P) and potassium (K)] and soil organic carbon content affected the wheat yield, WP c , and NUE f more significantly than climatic factors [mean annual temperature (MAT)] or water and N management practices. The structural equation-based modeling indicated that initial soil nutrient condition impacted productivity and resource use efficiency more at the below optimal water and N levels than above. The risk-factor-based feature ranking indicated that site-specific environmental and soil condition was highly informative toward model construction but split input of N or water had less impact on yield and input use efficiency. LCA demonstrated that to further mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, water- or N-saving management should be promoted in China. Collectively, our research implies that long-term soil health and nutrient enhancement should be more beneficial for increasing yield and resource use efficiency in wheat production.",We thank all authors who provided data for this study.

These agricultural activities have profoundly impacted soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in global drylands. However, the effects of clearing natural ecosystems for cropland (CNEC) on SOC are uncertain. To improve our understanding of carbon emissions and sequestration under different land uses, it is necessary to characterize the response patterns of SOC stocks to different types of CNEC. We conducted a meta-analysis with mixed-effect model based on 873 paired observations of SOC in croplands and adjacent natural ecosystems from 159 individual studies in global drylands. Our results indicate that CNEC significantly (p < .05) affects SOC stocks, resulting from a combination of natural land clearing, cropland management practices (fertilizer application, crop species, cultivation duration) and the significant negative effects of initial SOC stocks. Increases in SOC stocks (in 1 m depth) were found in croplands which previously natural land (deserts and shrublands) had low SOC stocks, and the increases were 278.86% (95% confidence interval, 196.43%-361.29%) and 45.38% (26.53%-62.23%), respectively. In contrast, SOC stocks (in 1 m depth) decreased by 24.11% (18.38%-29.85%) and 10.70% (1.80%-19.59%) in clearing forests and grasslands for cropland, respectively. We also established the general response curves of SOC stocks change to increasing cultivation duration, which is crucial for accurately estimating regional carbon dynamics following CNEC. SOC stocks increased significantly (p < .05) with high long-term fertilizer consumption in cleared grasslands with low initial SOC stocks (about 27.2 Mg ha-1 ). The results derived from our meta-analysis could be used for refining the estimation of dryland carbon dynamics and developing SOC sequestration strategies to achieve the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no.

Given the complex nature of the SOC pool, recent frameworks suggest that separating this pool into different functional components, for example, particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC), is of great importance for understanding and predicting SOC dynamics. Importantly, little is known about how these N-induced changes in SOC components (e.g., changes in the ratios among these fractions) would affect the functionality of the SOC pool, given the differences in nutrient density, resistance to disturbance, and turnover time between POC and MAOC pool. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 803 paired observations from 98 published studies to assess the effect of N addition on these SOC components, and the ratios among these fractions. We found that N addition, on average, significantly increased POC and MAOC pools by 16.4% and 3.7%, respectively. In contrast, both the ratios of MAOC to SOC and MAOC to POC were remarkably decreased by N enrichment (4.1% and 10.1%, respectively). Increases in the POC pool were positively correlated with changes in aboveground plant biomass and with hydrolytic enzymes. However, the positive responses of MAOC to N enrichment were correlated with increases in microbial biomass. Our results suggest that although reactive N deposition could facilitate soil C sequestration to some extent, it might decrease the nutrient density, turnover time, and resistance to disturbance of the SOC pool. Our study provides mechanistic insights into the effects of N enrichment on the SOC pool and its functionality at global scale, which is pivotal for understanding soil C dynamics especially in future scenarios with more frequent and severe perturbations.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the authors whose data were included in this meta‐analysis.

Fire changes nutrient cycles not only by volatilizing plant material, but also by altering organic matter decomposition, a process regulated by soil extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs). However, our understanding of fire effects on EEAs and their feedbacks to nutrient cycles is incomplete. We conducted a meta-analysis with 301 field studies and found that fire significantly decreased EEAs by ~20%-40%. Fire decreased EEAs by reducing soil microbial biomass and organic matter substrates. Soil nitrogen-acquiring EEA declined alongside decreasing available nitrogen, likely from fire-driven volatilization of nitrogen and decreased microbial activity. Fire decreased soil phosphorus-acquiring EEA but increased available phosphorus, likely from pyro-mineralization of organic phosphorus. These findings suggest that fire suppresses soil microbes and consumes their substrates, thereby slowing microbially mediated nutrient cycles (especially phosphorus) via decreased EEAs. These changes can become increasingly important as fire frequency and severity in many ecosystems continue to shift in response to global change.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Yong Zhou is supported by a G.

We conducted a meta-analysis on experimental data to evaluate the contributions of combining organic and mineral nitrogen (N) applications to the three pillars of CSA for maize (Zea mays). Linear mixed effect modeling was carried out for; (i) grain productivity and agronomic efficiency of N (AE) inputs, (ii) inter-seasonal yield variability, and (iii) changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) content, while accounting for the quality of organic amendments and total N rates. Results showed that combined application of mineral and organic fertilizers leads to greater responses in productivity and AE as compared to sole applications when more than 100 kg N ha-1 is used with high-quality organic matter. For yield variability and SOC, no significant interactions were found when combining mineral and organic fertilizers. The variability of maize yields in soils amended with high-quality organic matter, except manure, was equal or smaller than for sole mineral fertilizer. Increases of SOC were only significant for organic inputs, and more pronounced for high-quality resources. For example, at a total N rate of 150 kg N ha-1 season-1, combining mineral fertilizer with the highest quality organic resources (50:50) increased AE by 20% and reduced SOC losses by 18% over 7 growing seasons as compared to sole mineral fertilizer. We conclude that combining organic and mineral N fertilizers can have significant positive effects on productivity and AE, but only improves the other two CSA pillars yield variability and SOC depending on organic resource input and quality. The findings of our meta-analysis help to tailor a climate smart integrated soil fertility management in SSA.","The study was funded under the &quot;Integrated soil fertility management for climate smart intensification of maize-based cropping systems in Kenya&quot; project (number PJ-002705) by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich).

Donors, governments, and nongovernmental organizations have invested significant time and resources into developing and promoting agroforestry policies and programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) worldwide. While a large body of literature on the impacts of agroforestry practices in LMICs is available, the social-ecological impacts of agroforestry interventions is less well-studied. This knowledge gap on the effectiveness of agroforestry interventions constrains possibilities for evidence-based policy and investment decisions to advance sustainable development objectives.
Objectives: The primary objective of this Campbell systematic review was to synthesize the available evidence on the impacts of agroforestry interventions in LMICs on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. The secondary objectives were to identify key pathways through which agroforestry interventions lead to various outcomes and how the interventions affect different sub-groups of the population.
Search Methods: This review is based on a previously created evidence and gap map (EGM) of studies evaluating the impacts of agroforestry practices and interventions on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. We included published and unpublished literature in the English language covering the period between 2000 and October 20, 2017. We searched six academic databases and 19 organization websites to identify potentially relevant studies. The search was conducted for our EGM in mid-2017, and we did not conduct an additional search for this systematic review.
Selection Criteria: We included randomized control trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies assessing the effect of an agroforestry intervention on at least one outcome measure of agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, or human well-being for farmers and their farmland in LMICs. Agroforestry interventions include any program or policy designed to promote and support the adoption or maintenance of agroforestry practices, which include trees on farms, silvopasture, shade-grown crops, and homegardens with trees, among others. Moreover, the studies needed to include a nonagroforestry comparator, such as conventional agriculture or forestry systems or a before-after comparison.
Data Collection and Analysis: We used a standardized data extraction spreadsheet to extract details about each included study. We also used a standardized form to assess risk of bias for each of the included studies in this SR. Meta-analysis techniques were used to combine and synthesize effect size estimates for the outcomes measures that had sufficient data. We used a random effects models for the meta-analyses and use Hedge's g (difference in means divided by the pooled standard deviation) to report effect size estimates. The outcomes without enough evidence for meta-analysis were discussed narratively.
Main Results: We identified 11 studies across nine countries, all of which used quasi-experimental methods. Overall, the quality of the evidence base was assessed as being low. Studies were rated as having high or critical risk of bias if they failed to convincingly address more than one of the main potential sources of bias, namely selection bias, group equivalence, and spillover effects. Given the low number of studies and the high risk of bias of the evidence base, the results of this SR are limited and should be considered a baseline for future work. The results of the meta-analysis for impacts on yields indicated that agroforestry interventions overall may lead to a large, positive impact on yield (Hedge's g = 1.16 [-0.35, 2.67] (p = .13)), though there was high heterogeneity in the results (I 2 = 98.99%, τ 2   = 2.94, Q(df = 4)  = 370.7). There were positive yield impacts for soil fertility replenishment practices, including incorporating trees in agricultural fields and improved fallow practices in fields where there are severe soil fertility issues. In other cases, incorporating trees into the production system reduced productivity and took land out of production for conservation benefits. These systems generally used an incentive provision scheme to economically offset the reductions in yields. The result of the meta-analysis on income suggests that agroforestry interventions overall may lead to a small, positive impact on income (Hedge's g = 0.12 [-0.06, 0.30] (p = .20)), with moderately high heterogeneity in the results (I 2 = 75.29%, τ 2   = 0.04, Q(df = 6) = 19.16). In cases where improvement yields were reported, there were generally attendant improvements in income. In the cases where payments were provided to offset the potential loss in yields, incomes also generally improved, though there were mixed results for the certification programs and the tenure security permitting scheme. One program, which study authors suggested may have been poorly targeted, had negative yield impacts. There was not enough comparable evidence to quantitatively synthesize the impacts of agroforestry interventions on nutrition and food security outcomes, though the results indicted positive or neutral impacts on dietary diversity and food intake were likely. Surprisingly, there was little evidence on the impacts of agroforestry interventions on environmental outcomes, and there was no consistency of environmental indicator variables used. However, what has been studied indicates that the environmental benefits are being achieved to at least some extent, consistent with the broader literature on agroforestry practices. The evidence base was insufficient to evaluate the interaction between environmental and social impacts. Several studies explicitly considered variable impacts across different population sub-groups, including differential impacts on small-holders versus large-holders, on woman-headed households versus male-headed households, and on richer groups versus poorer groups. Small-holder farmers typically experienced the most positive effect sizes due to the agroforestry interventions. Women and poorer groups had mixed outcomes relative to men and richer households, highlighting the importance of considering these groups in intervention design.
Authors' Conclusions: There is limited evidence of the impacts of agroforestry interventions, restricting our ability to draw conclusions on the effect sizes of different intervention types. The existing evidence forms a baseline for future research and highlights the importance of considering equity and socio-economic factors in determining suitable intervention design. Some key implications for practice and policy include investing in programs that include pilot programs, funding for project evaluation, and that address key equity issues, such as targeting to smallholders, women, poor, and marginalized groups. Funding should also be given to implementing RCTs and more rigorous quasi-experimental impact evaluations of agroforestry interventions over longer time-periods to collect robust evidence of the effectiveness of various schemes promoting agroforestry practices.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank members of the advisory group to the agroforestry evidence gap map (EGM), Kahlil Baker, Samantha Cheng, Steve Franzel, Irina Klytchnikova, and Frank Place.

To cope with global climate change, nature based solutions (NBS) are desirable because these lead to improve our environment. Environmental stresses such as drought and salinity are big soil problems and can be eradicated by increasing soil organic matter which is directly related to soil organic carbon (SOC). SOC is one of the key components of the worldwide carbon (C) cycle. Different types of land use patterns have shown significant impacts on SOC stocks. However, their effects on the various SOC fractions are not well-understood at the global level which make it difficult to predict how SOC changes over time. We aim to investigate changes in various SOC fractions, including mineral associated organic carbon (MAOC), mineral associated organic matter (MAOM), soil organic carbon (SOC), easily oxidized organic carbon (EOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) under various types of land use patterns (NBS), including cropping pattern, residue management, conservation tillages such as no tillage (NT) and reduced tillage (RT) using data from 97 studies on a global scale. The results showed that NT overall increased MAOC, MAOM, SOC, MBC, EOC and POC by 16.2%, 26.8%, 24.1%, 16.2%, 27.9% and 33.2% (P < 0.05) compared to CT. No tillage with residue retention (NTR) increased MAOC, MAOM, SOC, MBC, EOC and POC by 38.0%, 29.9%, 47.5%, 33.1%, 35.7% and 49.0%, respectively, compared to CT (P < 0.05). RT overall increased MAOC, MAOM, SOC, MBC, EOC and POC by 36.8%, 14.1%, 25.8%, 25.9, 18.7% and 16.6% (P < 0.05) compared to CT. Reduced tillage with residue retention (RTR) increased MAOM, SOC and POC by 14.2%, 36.2% and 30.7%, respectively, compared to CT (P < 0.05). Multiple cropping increased MAOC, MBC and EOC by 14.1%, 39.8% and 21.5%, respectively, compared to mono cropping (P < 0.05). The response ratios of SOC fractions (MAOC, MAOM, SOC, MBC, EOC and POC) under NT and RT were mostly influenced by NBS such as residue management, cropping pattern along with soil depth, mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature and soil texture. Our findings imply that when assessing the effects of conservation tillage methods on SOC sequestration, SOC fractions especially those taking part in driving soil biological activities, should be taken into account rather than total SOC. We conclude that conservation tillages under multiple cropping systems and with retention of crop residues enhance soil carbon sequestration as compared to CT in varying edaphic and climatic conditions of the world.",,"This study is under the auspices of NSFC 42071267, the Program for Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) with the University of Henan, Henan Province (21IRTSTHN008) and the Scientific and Technological Research Projects in Henan Province (222102320472).",Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2022-09-21,2022,2022-09-21,,13,,1007222,All OA; Gold,Article,"Adil, Muhammad; Yao, Zijie; Zhang, Cheng; Lu, Siqi; Fu, Shenglei; Mosa, Walid F.

A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Straw returning is a sustainable way that does not destroy soil ecology in agronomic management. Some studies have found that straw returning may aggravate or reduce soilborne diseases in the past few decades. Despite the increasing number of independent studies investigated the effect of straw returning on root rot of crops, the quantitative analysis regarding the relationship between straw returning and crop root rot is still undefined. In this study, keywords co-occurrence matrix was extracted from 2489 published studies (published from 2000 to 2022, the same below) on controlling soilborne diseases of crops. The methods used for soilborne diseases prevention have shifted from chemical to biological and agricultural control since 2010. As root rot is the soilborne disease with the largest weight in keyword co-occurrence according to statistics, we further collected 531 articles focusing on crop root rot. Notably, the 531 studies are mainly distributed in the United States, Canada, China and other countries in Europe and the south and southeast of Asia, and focus on the root rot of soybean, tomato, wheat and other important grain crops or economic crops. Based on the meta-analysis of 534 measurements in 47 previous studies, we explored how 10 management factors (soil pH/texture, type/size of straw, depth/rate/cumulative amount of application, days after application, beneficial/pathogenic microorganism inoculated before application and annual N-fertilizer input) during straw returning affect root rot onset worldwide. The results showed that straw size and microorganisms inoculated before straw returning are the key factors affecting the incidence of root rot.

However, approximately 200,000 ha of mangroves and an unknown area of seagrass have been lost due to coastal development associated with urban, industrial and tourist purposes. In 2018, the approved reforms to the General Law on Climate Change (LGCC) aligned the Mexican law with the international objectives established in the 2nd Article of the Paris Agreement. This action proves Mexico's commitment to contributing to the global target of stabilizing the greenhouse gas emissions concentration in the planet. Thus, restoring and conserving mangrove and seagrass habitats could contribute to fulfilling this commitment. Therefore, as a first step in establishing a mitigation and adaptation plan against climate change with respect to conservation and restoration actions of these ecosystems, we evaluated Mexican blue carbon ecosystems through a systematic review of the carbon stock using the standardized method of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We used the data from 126 eligible studies for both ecosystems (n = 1220). The results indicated that information is missing at the regional level. However, the average above and below ground organic carbon stocks from mangroves in Mexico is 113.6 ± 5.5 (95% CI [99.3-118.4]) Mg Corg ha-1 and 385.1 ± 22 (95% CI [344.5-431.9]) Mg Corg ha-1, respectively. The variability in the Corg stocks for both blue carbon ecosystems in Mexico is related to variations in climate, hydrology and geomorphology observed along the country's coasts in addition to the size and number of plots evaluated with respect to the spatial cover. The highest values for mangroves were related to humid climate conditions, although in the case of seagrasses, they were related to low levels of hydrodynamic stress. Based on the official extent of mangrove and seagrass area in Mexico, we estimate a total carbon stock of 237.7 Tg Corg from mangroves and 48.1 Tg Corg from seagrasses. However, mangroves and seagrasses are still being lost due to land use change despite Mexican laws meant to incorporate environmental compensation. Such losses are largely due to loopholes in the legal framework that dilute the laws' effectiveness and thus ability to protect the ecosystem. The estimated emissions from land use change under a conservative approach in mangroves of Mexico were approximately 24 Tg CO2e in the last 20 years. Therefore, the incorporation of blue carbon into the carbon market as a viable source of supplemental finance for mangrove and seagrass protection is an attractive win-win opportunity.","This work was supported by United Nations Development Programme (No. CSP-2016-057), National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (Mexico) (No. FN009 &amp; No. KN003), National Forestry Commission (Mexico) (No. 137252), Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Mexico) (No. S0010-1108099).

Plastic film mulched ridge-furrow is one of the most widely adopted agronomic and field management practices in rain-fed agriculture in dry-land areas of China. The efficiency of plastic film mulching as a viable method to decrease evapotranspiration (ET), increase crop yields, and water use efficiency (WUE), has been demonstrated extensively by earlier studies.
METHODS: A comprehensive evaluation of how co-application of plastic-film mulch and biochar in different agro-environments under varying climatic conditions influence ET, crop yield, WUE, and soil microbial activity were assessed. We performed a meta-analysis using the PRISMA guideline to assess the effect of plastic-film mulched ridge-furrow and biochar on ET, yield, and WUE of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), and maize (Zea mays L.) in northern China.
RESULTS: The use of plastic film increased average yields of wheat (75.7%), potato (20.2%), and maize (12.9%) in Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces, respectively due to the reduction in ET by 12.8% in Gansu, 0.5% in Ningxia, and 4.1% in Shanxi, but increased in Shaanxi by 0.5% compared to no-mulching. These changes may be attributed to the effect of plastic film mulch application which simultaneously increased WUE by 68.5% in Gansu, 23.9% in Ningxia, 16.2% in Shaanxi, and 12.8% in Shanxi, respectively. Compared to flat planting without mulching, in three years, the yield of maize increased with the co-application of plastic film and biochar by 22.86% in the Shanxi and Shaanxi regions.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis revealed co-application of plastic film with biochar is integral for improving soil and water conservation in rain-fed agriculture and as an integrated practice to avert drought while simultaneously mitigating runoff and erosion.","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42061050 and 41661059).

Healthy soil is needed to grow crops, provides food, and sustains populations. It supports diverse ecosystems and critical ecological services such as pollination. It stores water and prevents floods. It captures carbon and slows global climate change. Soil pollution is a great and growing threat to human health. Soil may be polluted by heavy metals, organic chemicals such as pesticides, biological pathogens, and micro/nanoplastic particles. Pollution reduces soil's ability to yield food. It results in food crop contamination and disease. Soil pollutants wash into rivers causing water pollution. Deforestation causes soil erosion, liberates sequestered pollutants, and generates airborne dust. Pollution of air, water, and soil is responsible for at least 9 million deaths each year. More than 60% of pollution-related disease and death is due to cardiovascular disease. Recognizing the importance of pollution to human health, the European Commission and the EU Action Plan for 2050: A Healthy Planet for All, have determined that air, water, and soil pollution must be reduced to levels that cause no harm to human or ecosystem health. We are thus required to create a toxic-free environment, respect the concept of a safe operating space for humanity, and sustain the health of our planet for future generations.

A key indicator of soil productivity is soil organic carbon (SOC), which influences the provision of most soil ecosystem services. A major challenge in direct measurement of changes in SOC stock is that it is difficult to detect within a short timeframe relevant to land managers. In this study, we sought to identify suitable early indicators of changes in SOC stock and their drivers. A meta-analytical approach was used to synthesize global data on the impacts of arable land conversion to other uses on total SOC stock, 12 different SOC fractions and three soil structural properties. The conversion of arable lands to forests and grasslands accounted for 91 % of the available land use change datasets used for the meta-analysis and were mostly from Asia and Europe. Land use change from arable lands led to 50 % (32-68 %) mean increase in both labile (microbial biomass C and particulate organic C - POC) and passive (microaggregate, 53-250 μm diameter; and small macroaggregate, 250-2000 μm diameter) SOC fractions as well as soil structural stability. There was also 37 % (24-50 %) mean increase in total SOC stock in the experimental fields where the various SOC fractions were measured. Only the POC and the organic carbon stored in small macroaggregates had strong correlation with total SOC: our findings reveal these two SOC fractions were predominantly controlled by biomass input to the soil rather than climatic factors and are thus suitable candidate indicators of short-term changes in total SOC stock. Further field studies are recommended to validate the predictive power of the equations we developed in this study and the use of the SOC metrics under different land use change scenarios.",We would like to thank the University of Lincoln for sponsoring the Lincoln Soil Project under which this study was carried out.

However, the integrated effects on net greenhouse gas budget (NGHGB) and grain yield from different management practices remain poorly defined and vary with environmental and application conditions. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis on 347 observation sets of non-CO2 GHG (CH4 and N2 O) emissions and grain yield, and 412 observations of soil organic carbon sequestration rate (SOCSR). Our results show that for paddy rice, replacing synthetic nitrogen at the rate of 30%-59% with organic fertilizer significantly decreased net GHG emissions (NGHGB: -15.3 ± 3.4 [standard error], SOCSR: -15.8 ± 3.8, non-CO2 GHGs: 0.6 ± 0.1 in Mg CO2 eq ha-1  year-1 ) and improved rice yield (0.4 ± 0.1 in Mg ha-1  year-1 ). In contrast, intermittent irrigation significantly increased net GHG emissions by 11.2 ± 3.1 and decreased rice yield by 0.4 ± 0.1. The reduction in SOC sequestration by intermittent irrigation (15.5 ± 3.3), which was most severe (>20) in alkaline soils (pH > 7.5), completely offset the mitigation in CH4 emissions. Straw return for paddy rice also led to a net increase in GHG emissions (NGHGB: 4.8 ± 1.4) in silt-loam soils, where CH4 emissions (6.3 ± 1.3) were greatly stimulated. For upland cropping systems, mostly by enhancing SOC sequestration, straw return (NGHGB: -3.4 ± 0.8, yield: -0.5 ± 0.6) and no-tillage (NGHGB: -2.9 ± 0.7, yield: -0.1 ± 0.3) were more effective in warm climates. This study highlights the importance of carefully managing croplands to sequester SOC without sacrifice in yield while limiting CH4 emissions from rice paddies.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Belinda Medlyn and Mingkai Jiang for discussion on estimating interactive effect.

6132,pub.1142548619,10.1111/gcb.15988,34767298,,Soil carbon stocks in temperate grasslands differ strongly across sites but are insensitive to decade‐long fertilization,"Enhancing soil carbon (C) storage has the potential to offset human-caused increases in atmospheric CO2 . Rising CO2 has occurred concurrently with increasing supply rates of biologically limiting nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). However, it is unclear how increased supplies of N and P will alter soil C sequestration, particularly in grasslands, which make up nearly a third of non-agricultural land worldwide. Here, we leverage a globally distributed nutrient addition experiment (the Nutrient Network) to examine how a decade of N and P fertilization (alone and in combination) influenced soil C and N stocks at nine grassland sites spanning the continental United States. We measured changes in bulk soil C and N stocks and in three soil C fractions (light and heavy particulate organic matter, and mineral-associated organic matter fractions). Nutrient amendment had variable effects on soil C and N pools that ranged from strongly positive to strongly negative, while soil C and N pool sizes varied by more than an order of magnitude across sites. Piecewise SEM clarified that small increases in plant C inputs with fertilization did not translate to greater soil C storage. Nevertheless, peak season aboveground plant biomass (but not root biomass or production) was strongly positively related to soil C storage at seven of the nine sites, and across all nine sites, soil C covaried with moisture index and soil mineralogy, regardless of fertilization. Overall, we show that site factors such as moisture index, plant productivity, soil texture, and mineralogy were key predictors of cross-site soil C, while nutrient amendment had weaker and site-specific effects on C sequestration. This suggests that prioritizing the protection of highly productive temperate grasslands is critical for reducing future greenhouse gas losses arising from land use change.","This work was supported by grants from the NSF Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research (183194) and Ecosystem Studies (1556529, 1556418, and 1556410) programs.

Soil aggregation contributes to the stability of soil structure and to soil C sequestration. Although many studies have reported the effects of N enrichment on bulk soil C dynamics, the underlying mechanisms explaining how soil aggregates respond to N enrichment remain unclear. Here, we used a meta-analysis of data from 76N manipulation experiments in terrestrial ecosystems in China to assess the effects of N enrichment on soil aggregation and its sequestration of C. On average, N enrichment significantly increased the mean weight diameter of soil aggregates by 10%. The proportion of macroaggregates and silt-clay fraction were significantly increased (6%) and decreased (9%) by N enrichment, respectively. A greater response of macroaggregate C (+15%) than of bulk soil C (+5%) to N enrichment was detected across all ecosystems. However, N enrichment had minor effects on microaggregate C and silt-clay C. The magnitude of N enrichment effect on soil aggregation varied with ecosystem type and fertilization regime. Additionally, soil pH declined consistently and was correlated with soil aggregate C. Overall, our meta-analysis suggests that N enrichment promotes particulate organic C accumulation via increasing macroaggregate C and acidifying soils. In contrast, increases in soil aggregation could inhibit microbially mediated breakdown of soil organic matter, causing minimal change in mineral-associated organic C. Our findings highlight that atmospheric N deposition may enhance the formation of soil aggregates and their sequestration of C in terrestrial ecosystems in China.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41471443), the Key Special Project for Introduced Talents Team of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (No. GML2019ZD0408), and the National Key Research and Development project (No. 2018YFD0800201).

Since then a wealth of data has been generated on uptake of pharmaceuticals into plants. However, to the best of our knowledge these studies have not been systematically reviewed. Here, we present a quantitative, systematic review of empirical data on the uptake of pharmaceuticals into crops. A bespoke relational database on plant uptake of pharmaceuticals was developed. The database contained details of the experimental design and associated results from 150 articles, spanning 173 pharmaceuticals, 78 study crops and 8048 unique measurements. Analysis of the data in the database showed clear trends in experimental design with lettuce being the most studied crop and carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole being the most studied pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceutical properties were found to create the greatest range in uptake concentrations of any single variable studied. Uptake concentrations were also found to vary between crops, with relatively high uptake concentrations identified in cress, lettuce, rice and courgette crops. Understanding of the influence of soil properties on pharmaceutical uptake was limited by a lack in reporting of key soil properties across the published literature. The data comparisons were inhibited by differences in quality of the different studies. Moving forwards, a framework for best practice in this field is needed to maximise the value and further applications of data produced.",,,Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,,,,2023-06-21,2023,2023-06-21,2023-06-21,,,,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Sleight, Harriet; Boxall, Alistair B.

We examined the question of whether animal manure application affects the soil microbial ecology of farmlands. The effects of global animal manure application on soil microorganisms were subjected to a meta-analysis based on randomized controlled treatments. A total of 2303 studies conducted in the last 30 years were incorporated into the analysis, and an additional 45 soil samples were collected and sequenced to obtain 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA data. The results revealed that manure application increased soil microbial biomass. Manure application alone increased bacterial diversity (M-Z: 7.546 and M-I: 8.68) and inhibited and reduced fungal diversity (M-Z: -1.15 and M-I: -1.03). Inorganic fertilizer replaced cattle and swine manure and provided nutrients to soil microorganisms. The soil samples of the experimental base were analyzed, and the relative abundances of bacteria and fungi were altered compared with no manure application. Manure increased bacterial diversity and reduced fungal diversity. Mrakia frigida and Betaproteobacteriales, which inhibit other microorganisms, increased significantly in the domesticated soil. Moreover, farm sewage treatments resulted in a bottleneck in the manure recovery rate that should be the focus of future research. Our results suggest that the potential risks of restructuring the microbial ecology of cultivated land must be considered.",We would like to thank LetPub (www.letpub.com) for its linguistic assistance during the preparation of this manuscript.,"This work was supported by China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA (CARS-36) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (31872980, U20A2052).

Achieving this is expected to require removal of CO2 from the atmosphere to offset some hard-to-eliminate emissions. There is, therefore, a clear need for GHG accounting protocols that quantify the mitigation impact of CO2 removal practices, such as biochar sequestration, that have the potential to be deployed at scale. Here, we have developed a GHG accounting methodology for biochar application to mineral soils using simple parameterizations and readily accessible activity data that can be applied at a range of scales including farm, supply chain, national, or global. The method is grounded in a comprehensive analysis of current empirical data, making it a robust method that can be used for many applications including national inventories and voluntary and compliance carbon markets, among others. We show that the carbon content of biochar varies with feedstock and production conditions from as low as 7% (gasification of biosolids) to 79% (pyrolysis of wood at above 600 °C). Of this initial carbon, 63-82% will remain unmineralized in soil after 100 years at the global mean annual cropland-temperature of 14.9 °C. With this method, researchers and managers can address the long-term sequestration of C through biochar that is blended with soils through assessments such as GHG inventories and life cycle analyses.","The authors thank the Cornell Institute for Digital Agriculture (CIDA) for funding to support D.W.; U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture (grant 2014-67003-22069), the National Science Foundation (NSF-BREAD IOS-0965336), The Nature Conservancy (2018-19-204), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP51589), and Fondation des Fondateurs for supporting J.L. &amp; D.W.; and the Canadian Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada for funding to support BM.",,Environmental Science and Technology,,,Agriculture; Carbon Dioxide; Charcoal; Greenhouse Gases; Nitrous Oxide; Soil,2021-10-12,2021,2021-10-12,2021-11-02,55,21,14795-14805,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Woolf, Dominic; Lehmann, Johannes; Ogle, Stephen; Kishimoto-Mo, Ayaka W.; McConkey, Brian; Baldock, Jeffrey","Woolf, Dominic (School of Integrative Plant Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, 14953, United States; Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, 14953, United States); Lehmann, Johannes (School of Integrative Plant Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, 14953, United States; Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, 14953, United States); Ogle, Stephen (Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, 80523, United States); Kishimoto-Mo, Ayaka W.

Yet, our knowledge regarding warming effects on root: shoot ratio (R/S) remains limited. Here, we present a meta-analysis encompassing more than 300 studies and including angiosperms and gymnosperms as well as different biomes (cropland, desert, forest, grassland, tundra, and wetland). The meta-analysis shows that average warming of 2.50 °C (median = 2 °C) significantly increases biomass allocation to roots with a mean increase of 8.1% in R/S. Two factors associate significantly with this response to warming: mean annual precipitation and the type of mycorrhizal fungi associated with plants. Warming-induced allocation to roots is greater in drier habitats when compared to shoots (+15.1% in R/S), while lower in wetter habitats (+4.9% in R/S). This R/S pattern is more frequent in plants associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, compared to ectomycorrhizal fungi. These results show that precipitation variability and mycorrhizal association can affect terrestrial carbon dynamics by influencing biomass allocation strategies in a warmer world, suggesting that climate change could influence belowground C sequestration.","We thank Pryianka Ambhavane (https://ambypriya.myportfolio.com/) for her help in drawing Fig. 7.

Microbial-mediated decomposition processes are fundamental for the fate and persistence of sequestered C in soil, but the underlying mechanisms are uncertain. Here, we synthesise 923 observations regarding the effects of biochar addition (over periods ranging from several weeks to several years) on soil C-degrading enzyme activities from 130 articles across five continents worldwide. Our results showed that biochar addition increased soil ligninase activity targeting complex phenolic macromolecules by 7.1%, but suppressed cellulase activity degrading simpler polysaccharides by 8.3%. These shifts in enzyme activities explained the most variation of changes in soil C sequestration across a wide range of climatic, edaphic and experimental conditions, with biochar-induced shift in ligninase:cellulase ratio correlating negatively with soil C sequestration. Specifically, short-term (<1 year) biochar addition significantly reduced cellulase activity by 4.6% and enhanced soil organic C sequestration by 87.5%, whereas no significant responses were observed for ligninase activity and ligninase:cellulase ratio. However, long-term (≥1 year) biochar addition significantly enhanced ligninase activity by 5.2% and ligninase:cellulase ratio by 36.1%, leading to a smaller increase in soil organic C sequestration (25.1%). These results suggest that shifts in enzyme activities increased ligninase:cellulase ratio with time after biochar addition, limiting long-term soil C sequestration with biochar addition. Our work provides novel evidence to explain the diminished soil C sequestration with long-term biochar addition and suggests that earlier studies may have overestimated soil C sequestration with biochar addition by failing to consider the physiological acclimation of soil microorganisms over time.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank all the authors whose data and work are included in this meta‐analysis.

In this review, we introduce the mechanisms by which plants facilitate P-uptake and illustrate how PSB improve the bioavailability of this nutrient. Next, the effectiveness of PSB on increasing plant biomass and P-uptake is assessed using a meta-analysis approach. Our review demonstrates that improved P-uptake does not always translate in improved plant height and biomass. We show that the effect of PSB on plants does not provide an added benefit when using bacterial consortia compared to single strains. Moreover, the commonly reported species for P-solubilization, Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp., are outperformed by the scarcely implemented Burkholderia spp. Despite the similar responses to PSB in monocots and eudicots, species responsiveness to PSB varies within both clades. Remarkably, the meta-analysis challenges the common belief that PSB are less effective under field conditions compared to greenhouse conditions. This review provides innovative insights and identifies key questions for future research on PSB to promote their implementation in agriculture.",,"This project was supported by a research grant provided by the Research Foundation–Flanders (FWO), through a SB scholarship (1S01620N).",Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2022-03-02,2022,2022-03-02,,13,,858804,All OA; Gold,Article,"De Zutter, Noémie; Ameye, Maarten; Bekaert, Boris; Verwaeren, Jan; De Gelder, Leen; Audenaert, Kris","De Zutter, Noémie (Laboratory of Applied Mycology and Phenomics (LAMP), Department of Plants and Crops, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; Laboratory of Environmental Biotechnology, Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium); Ameye, Maarten (Laboratory of Applied Mycology and Phenomics (LAMP), Department of Plants and Crops, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium); Bekaert, Boris (Laboratory of Applied Mycology and Phenomics (LAMP), Department of Plants and Crops, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium); Verwaeren, Jan (Research Unit Knowledge-based Systems (KERMIT), Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium); De Gelder, Leen (Laboratory of Environmental Biotechnology, Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium); Audenaert, Kris (Laboratory of Applied Mycology and Phenomics (LAMP), Department of Plants and Crops, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium)","De Zutter, Noémie (Ghent University; Ghent University)","De Zutter, Noémie (Ghent University; Ghent University); Ameye, Maarten (Ghent University); Bekaert, Boris (Ghent University); Verwaeren, Jan (Ghent University); De Gelder, Leen (Ghent University); Audenaert, Kris (Ghent University)",9,9,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.858804/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145996790,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 31 Biological Sciences",2 Zero Hunger

It encompasses large proportion of microscopic biodiversity, including prokaryotes and the microscopic eukaryotes. Soil microbiome is critical in managing the soil functions, but their activities have diminutive recognition in few systems like desert land and forest ecosystems. Soil microbiome is highly dependent on abiotic and biotic factors like pH, carbon content, soil structure, texture, and vegetation, but it can notably vary with ecosystems and the respective inhabitants. Thus, unboxing this black box is essential to comprehend the basic components adding to the soil systems and supported ecosystem services. Recent advancements in the field of molecular microbial ecology have delivered commanding tools to examine this genetic trove of soil biodiversity. Objective of this review is to provide a critical evaluation of the work on the soil microbiome, especially since the advent of the NGS techniques. The review also focuses on advances in our understanding of soil communities, their interactions, and functional capabilities along with understanding their role in maneuvering the biogeochemical cycle while underlining and tapping the unprecedented metagenomics data to infer the ecological attributes of yet undiscovered soil microbiome. This review focuses key research directions that could shape the future of basic and applied research into the soil microbiome. This review has led us to understand that it is difficult to generalize that soil microbiome plays a substantiated role in shaping the soil networks and it is indeed a vital resource for sustaining the ecosystem functioning. Exploring soil microbiome will help in unlocking their roles in various soil network. It could be resourceful in exploring and forecasting its impacts on soil systems and for dealing with alleviating problems like rapid climate change.","The authors are grateful to CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute [CSIR-NEERI] for providing infrastructure facilities and acknowledge the Director, CSIR-NEERI.

However, crop residues can also potentially stimulate emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) from soils. A better understanding of how to mitigate N2O emissions due to crop residue management while promoting positive effects on soil carbon is needed to reconcile the opposing effects of crop residues on the greenhouse gas balance of agroecosystems. Here, we combine a literature review and a meta-analysis to identify and assess measures for mitigating N2O emissions due to crop residue application to agricultural fields. Our study shows that crop residue removal, shallow incorporation, incorporation of residues with C:N ratio > 30 and avoiding incorporation of residues from crops terminated at an immature physiological stage, are measures leading to significantly lower N2O emissions. Other practices such as incorporation timing and interactions with fertilisers are less conclusive. Several of the evaluated N2O mitigation measures implied negative side-effects on yield, soil organic carbon storage, nitrate leaching and/or ammonia volatilization. We identified additional strategies with potential to reduce crop residue N2O emissions without strong negative side-effects, which require further research. These are: a) treatment of crop residues before field application, e.g., conversion of residues into biochar or anaerobic digestate, b) co-application with nitrification inhibitors or N-immobilizing materials such as compost with a high C:N ratio, paper waste or sawdust, and c) use of residues obtained from crop mixtures. Our study provides a scientific basis to be developed over the coming years on how to increase the sustainability of agroecosystems though adequate crop residue management.","This study was supported by the FACCE ERA-GAS Cofund (European Research Area – for mitigation of Greenhouse gases from Agri- and Silvi-culture; id number: 696356), project ResidueGas (https://projects.au.dk/residuegas/).

Global change factors such as anthropogenic nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) inputs, climate warming, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO2 ), and periodic precipitation reduction (drought) strongly affect soil microorganisms and consequently, influence microbial necromass formation. The impacts of these global change factors on microbial necromass are poorly understood despite their critical role in the cycling and sequestration of soil carbon (C) and nutrients. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to reveal general patterns of the effects of nutrient addition, warming, eCO2 , and drought on amino sugars (biomarkers of microbial necromass) in soils under croplands, forests, and grasslands. Nitrogen addition combined with P and K increased the content of fungal (+21%), bacterial (+22%), and total amino sugars (+9%), consequently leading to increased SOM formation. Nitrogen addition alone increased solely bacterial necromass (+10%) because the decrease of N limitation stimulated bacterial more than fungal growth. Warming increased bacterial necromass, because bacteria have competitive advantages at high temperatures compared to fungi. Other global change factors (P and NP addition, eCO2 , and drought) had minor effects on microbial necromass because of: (i) compensation of the impacts by opposite processes, and (ii) the short duration of experiments compared to the slow microbial necromass turnover. Future studies should focus on: (i) the stronger response of bacterial necromass to N addition and warming compared to that of fungi, and (ii) the increased microbial necromass contribution to SOM accumulation and stability under NPK fertilization, and thereby for negative feedback to climate warming.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to the authors of original studies to global change experiments included in the meta‐analysis.

Poor management of the composting process can result in a decrease in the final compost quality and negative environmental impacts. Optimization technologies during composting have varied effects on the mitigation of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) losses. To determine the feasibility and effectiveness of mitigation options, a meta-analysis was performed based on 68 studies in which C and/or N losses were investigated during pig manure composting. The results indicated that 48.7% of the total C (TC) was lost with 34.8% as CO2-C and 0.9% as CH4-C, and 27.5% of the total N (TN) was lost with 17.1% as NH3-N and 1.5% as N2O-N. The composting method and bulking agent type obviously influenced the C and N losses. CO2-C and CH4-C emission was significantly influenced by the initial C/N ratio and moisture, respectively. At the same time, NH3-N and N2O-N emissions were remarkably affected by the initial pH and composting duration, respectively. The results of the meta-analysis showed that TC and TN losses were reduced by 12.4% and 27.5%, respectively. Controlling feedstock, including the C/N ratio and moisture, could be regarded as N conservation technology. Controlling aeration, including turning frequency and ventilation rate, would be reliable in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Applying additives, especially biochar and superphosphate, was found to be an effective method for synergistically mitigating C and N losses. Therefore, the production of high-quality compost products and minimization of environmental pollution will be achieved by a combination of adjusting the initial substrate properties, controlling the composting process conditions and applying additives.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In this work, meta-analysis was used to examine the impacts of drought on grassland ecosystems in recent decades. According to the results, drought greatly reduced aboveground biomass (AGB), aboveground net primary production (ANPP), height, belowground biomass (BGB), belowground net primary production (BNPP), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and soil respiration (SR), and increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), and the ratio of microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen (MBC/MBN). The drought-related environmental factor mean annual temperature (MAT) was negatively correlated with AGB, height, ANPP, BNPP, MBC, and MBN, however, mean annual precipitation (MAP) had positive effect on these variables. These findings indicate that drought is threatening the biotic environment of grassland ecosystem, and the positive steps should be taken to address the negative effects of drought on grassland ecosystems due to climate change.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (2021YFD1300503), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 32271764), and the Earmarked fund for CARS (CARS‐34).

However, despite the obvious role that biota play in the global carbon cycle, the effects of biotic interactions on carbon pools and fluxes are poorly understood. Here we develop a conceptual framework that illustrates the importance of biotic interactions in regulating carbon cycling based on a literature review and a quantitative synthesis by means of meta-analysis. Our study focuses on blue carbon ecosystems-vegetated coastal ecosystems that function as the most effective long-term CO2 sinks of the biosphere. We demonstrate that a multitude of mutualistic, competitive and consumer-resource interactions between plants, animals and microbiota exert strong effects on carbon cycling across various spatial scales ranging from the rhizosphere to the landscape scale. Climate change-sensitive abiotic factors modulate the strength of biotic-interaction effects on carbon fluxes, suggesting that the importance of biota-mediated carbon cycling will change under future climatic conditions. Strong effects of biotic interactions on carbon cycling imply that biosphere-climate feedbacks may not be sufficiently represented in current Earth system models. Inclusion of new functional groups in these models, and new approaches to simplify species interactions, may thus improve the predictions of biotic effects on the global climate.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) – 407270017/RTG2530.

6106,pub.1156369807,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162965,36948308,,Negative responses of terrestrial nitrogen fixation to nitrogen addition weaken across increased soil organic carbon levels,"The traditional view holds that biological nitrogen (N) fixation is energetically expensive and thus, facultative N fixers reduce N fixation rates while obligate N fixers are excluded by non-N fixers as soil N becomes rich. This view, however, contradicts the phenomenon that N fixation does not decline in many terrestrial ecosystems under N enrichment. To address this paradoxical phenomenon, we conducted a meta-analysis of N fixation and diazotroph (N-fixing microorganism) community structure in response to N addition across terrestrial ecosystems. N addition inhibited N fixation, but the inhibitory effect weakened across increased soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations. The response ratios of N fixation (including free-living, plant-associated, and symbiotic types) to N addition were lower in the ecosystems with low SOC concentrations (<10 mg/g) than in those with medium or high SOC concentrations (10-20 and > 20 mg/g, respectively). The negative N-addition effects on diazotroph abundance and diversity also weakened across increased SOC levels. Among the climatic and soil factors, SOC was the most important predictor regarding the responses of N fixation and diazotroph community structure to N addition. Overall, our study reveals the role of SOC in affecting the responses of N fixation to N addition, which helps understand the relationships of biological N fixation and N enrichment as well as the mechanisms of terrestrial C and N coupling.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no conflict of interests.

Notwithstanding, reviewing most of the previous experimental studies on the impacts of biochar reveals a considerable inconsistency in the proposed results. The present study conducts a comprehensive meta-analysis on the literature published before February 2021 to investigate the impacts of biochar properties, experimental conditions, and soil properties on rice yield and NUE. The meta-analysis results show that biochar application increases rice yield and NUE by 10.73% and 12.04%, respectively. The most significant improvements in the soil properties are seen in alkaline soils and paddy soils with a fine-textured. In addition, the benefits of biochar are significantly enhanced when produced at 500-600 °C with livestock manure due to the existence of more nutrients compared to other feedstocks. Analysis of water management reveals that biochar application under water-saving irrigation is more effective in increasing rice productivity. In terms of application rates, the >20 t/ha biochar and 150-250 kg/ha nitrogen fertilizer are recommended for improving rice yield and NUE. Regardless of existing uncertainty due to the lack of long-term experimental data, those investigated factors have significant implications for biochar management strategies in rice growth systems.","This study has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52179022), the Key Scientific Research Project of Water Resources in Hubei Province (HBSLKY201707), and the Guiyang Engineering Corporation Limited (HBSLKY201817).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Agriculture; Charcoal; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Oryza; Soil,2022-03-25,2022,2022-03-25,2022-07,830,,154792,Closed,Article,"Liu, Yong; Li, Huandi; Hu, Tiesong; Mahmoud, Ali; Li, Jiang; Zhu, Rui; Jiao, Xiyun; Jing, Peiran","Liu, Yong (State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.); Li, Huandi (College of Agricultural Science and Engineering, Hohai University, Nanjing 211100, China.); Hu, Tiesong (State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.

Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 88 published studies to assess the response of N2O-related functional gene and transcript abundances, and community structure to NIs application. Application of NIs significantly reduced the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria ammonia monooxygenase (AOB amoA) genes, AOB amoA transcript and nitrite reductase (nirS and nirK) genes. The effectiveness of NIs on reducing the AOB amoA abundance was influenced by N form, soil texture, soil pH and the experimental type (field vs. laboratory). Specifically, NIs were more effective when a mixed inorganic and organic N source was applied to a medium-textured soils. The NIs effectiveness increased with increasing soil pH. The response of AOB amoA abundance to NIs application was not affected by NI type, N rate, soil moisture, soil temperature and soil organic carbon (SOC). The inhibitory effect of NIs on nirS abundance increased with increasing soil temperature. NIs decreased soil nitrifying enzyme activity (NEA) and denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA) by 34.5 % and 27.0 %, respectively, leading to an overall 63.6 % reduction of N2O emissions. Soil NEA correlated positively with the abundance and community structure of AOB amoA but not with AOA amoA. Decrease in DEA with NIs application coincided with the decreasing nirS and nirK abundances. This global-scale assessment demonstrates that the effectiveness of NIs in reducing N2O emissions was attributed to the inhibiting effects on AOB amoA, nirS and nirK genes. Our findings highlight that NIs' inhibition effects on bacterial ammonia-oxidizing community and the encode enzymes in transformation of nitrite to nitric oxide are the main mechanisms for mitigation of N fertilizer-induced N2O emissions.",This research was supported by the Research Manitoba New Investigator Operating Grants and the Start-up research fund at the University of Manitoba.,,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Soil; Archaea; Nitrification; Ammonia; Carbon; Fertilizers; Soil Microbiology; Nitrous Oxide,2022-12-28,2022,2022-12-28,2023-03,865,,161215,Closed,Article,"Yin, Mingyuan; Gao, Xiaopeng; Kuang, Wennong; Zhang, Yaohong","Yin, Mingyuan (Liaoning Key Laboratory of Urban Integrated Pest Management and Ecological Security, College of Life Science and Engineering, Shenyang University, Shenyang 110044, China.); Gao, Xiaopeng (Department of Soil Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.

However, how the biochar properties and composting conditions affect the composting process and quality and ecological risk of compost is still unclear. In the present study, we conducted a global meta-analysis based on 876 observations from 84 studies. Overall, regardless of biochar properties and composting conditions, biochar addition could significantly increase the pH (5.90%), germination index (26.6%), contents of nitrate nitrogen (56.6%), total nitrogen (9.50%), and total potassium (10.1%), and degree of polymerization (29.4%) while decrease the electrical conductivity (-5.70%), contents of ammonium nitrogen (-33.7%), bioavailable zinc (-22.9%), and bioavailable copper (-38.6%), and emissions of ammonia (-44.2%), nitrous oxide (-68.4%), and methane (-61.7%). Other compost indicators, including the carbon to nitrogen ratio and total phosphorus content, were found to be insignificantly affected by biochar addition. The responses of tested compost indicators affected by the biochar properties and composting conditions were further explored, based on which the addition of straw biochars at a rate of 10-15% was recommended due to its greater potential to improve quality of compost and reduce its ecological risk. Combining the results of linear regression analysis and structural equation model, the increase in compost pH caused by biochar addition was identified as the key mechanism for the increased nutrient content and decreased heavy metal bioavailability. These results could guide us to choose suitable kinds of biochar or develop engineered biochars with specific functionality to realize an optimal compost production mode.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41703084, 42076221, 22106136) and Demonstration and Guidance Program for Technology People-Benefit in Qingdao (20-3-4-6-nsh, 21-1-4-ny-1-nsh).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Charcoal; Composting; Nitrogen; Soil,2021-11-03,2021,2021-11-03,2022-02,806,Pt 4,151439,Closed,Article,"Zhou, Shunxi; Kong, Fanlong; Lu, Lun; Wang, Ping; Jiang, Zhixiang","Zhou, Shunxi (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China.); Kong, Fanlong (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China.); Lu, Lun (State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Health Risk Assessment, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510655, China.); Wang, Ping (Business School, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China.

Climate models suggest that many terrestrial ecosystems are at risk from future droughts, suggesting moisture limiting conditions will develop across a range of forests worldwide. The impacts of increasing drought conditions on forest carbon (C) fluxes due to shifts in organic matter decay rates may be poorly characterised due to limited experimental research. To appraise this question, we conducted a meta-analysis of forest drought experiment studies worldwide, examining spatial limits, knowledge gaps and potential biases. To identify limits to experimental knowledge, we projected the global distribution of forest drought experiments against spatially modelled estimates of (i) future precipitation change, (ii) ecosystem total above-ground C and (iii) soil C storage. Our assessment, involving 115 individual experimental study locations, found a mismatch between the distribution of forest drought experiments and regions with higher levels of future drought risk and C storage, such as Central America, Amazonia, the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, equatorial Africa and Indonesia. Decomposition rate responses in litter and soil were also relatively under-studied, with only 30 experiments specifically examining the potential experimental impacts of drought on C fluxes from soil or litter. We propose new approaches for engaging experimentally with forest drought research, utilising standardised protocols to appraise the impacts of drought on the C cycle, while targeting the most vulnerable and relevant forests.",Milla Baker of Scion for assistance with literature searches and data extraction.

Most advances in trait-based ecology to date centre on plant functional traits, although there is an increasing recognition that animal traits are also key contributors to processes operating at the community or ecosystem scale. Terrestrial invertebrates are incredibly diverse and ubiquitous animals with important roles in nutrient cycling. Despite their widespread influence on ecosystem processes, we currently lack a synthetic understanding of how invertebrate functional traits affect terrestrial nutrient cycling. We present a meta-analysis of 511 paired observations from 122 papers that examined how invertebrate functional traits affected litter decomposition rates, nitrogen pools and litter C:N ratios. Based on the available data, we specifically assessed the effects of feeding mode (bioturbation, detritus shredding, detritus grazing, leaf chewing, leaf piercing, ambush predators, active hunting predators) and body size (macro- and micro-invertebrates) on nutrient cycling. The effects of invertebrates on terrestrial nutrient cycling varied according to functional trait. The inclusion of both macro- (≥2 mm) and micro-invertebrates (<2 mm) increased litter decomposition by 20% and 19%, respectively. All detritivorous feeding modes enhanced litter decomposition rates, with bioturbators, detritus shredders and detritus grazers increasing decomposition by 28%, 22% and 15%, respectively. Neither herbivore feeding mode (e.g. leaf chewers and leaf piercers) nor predator hunting mode (ambush and active hunting) affected decomposition. We also revealed that bioturbators and detritus grazers increased soil nitrogen availability by 99% and 70%, respectively, and that leaf-chewing herbivores had a weak effect on litterfall stoichiometry via reducing C:N ratios by 11%. Although functional traits might be useful predictors of ecosystem processes, our findings suggest context-dependent effects of invertebrate traits on terrestrial nutrient cycling. Detritivore functional traits (i.e. bioturbators, detritus shredders and detritus grazers) are more consistent with increased rates of nutrient cycling, whereas our currently characterized predator and herbivore traits are less predictive. Future research is needed to identify, standardize and deliberately study the impacts of invertebrate functional traits on nutrient cycling in hopes of revealing the key functional traits governing ecosystem functioning worldwide.","This research was funded by a Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship awarded to M.A.M.

Such an outcome would involve the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from agroecosystems and optimization of soil organic carbon sequestration. Interest in biochar application is heightened by its several co-benefits. Several reviews summarized past investigations on biochar, but these reviews mostly included laboratory, greenhouse, and mesocosm experiments. A synthesis of field studies is lacking, especially from a climate change mitigation standpoint. Our objectives are to (1) synthesize advances in field-based studies that have examined the GHG mitigation capacity of soil application of biochar and (2) identify limitations of the technology and research priorities. Field studies, published before 2022, were reviewed. Biochar has variable effects on GHG emissions, ranging from decrease, increase, to no change. Across studies, biochar reduced emissions of nitrous oxide (N2 O) by 18% and methane (CH4 ) by 3% but increased carbon dioxide (CO2 ) by 1.9%. When biochar was combined with N-fertilizer, it reduced CO2 , CH4 , and N2 O emissions in 61%, 64%, and 84% of the observations, and biochar plus other amendments reduced emissions in 78%, 92%, and 85% of the observations, respectively. Biochar has shown potential to reduce GHG emissions from soils, but long-term studies are needed to address discrepancies in emissions and identify best practices (rate, depth, and frequency) of biochar application to agricultural soils.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are grateful to the Alfred P.

The results showed that microplastics presented no significant effects on soil dissolved organic carbon contents and the amounts of available phosphate, nitrate, and ammonium. Although microplastics would not significantly influence the diversity of soil microorganisms, they could significantly increase soil microorganism amounts with a standard mean difference at 19.32. We also found that microplastics tended to significantly decrease soil water stable macro-aggregate (> 0.25 mm) contents with a significantly negative standard mean difference (− 0.90) in meta-analysis.

Carbon stocks in above-ground biomass can recover to old-growth forest levels within 60-100 years. However, more than half of all carbon in tropical forests is stored below-ground, and our understanding of carbon storage in soils during tropical forest recovery is limited.Importantly, soil carbon accumulation does not necessarily reflect patterns in above-ground biomass carbon accrual during secondary forest succession, and factors related to past land use, species composition and soil characteristics may influence soil carbon storage during forest regrowth.Using tree census data and a measure of tree community shade tolerance (species-specific light response values), we assessed the relationship between soil organic carbon stocks and tree functional groups during secondary succession along a chronosequence of 40- to 120-year-old naturally regenerating secondary forest and old-growth tropical forest stands in Panama.While previous studies found no evidence for increasing soil C storage with secondary forest age, we found a strong relationship between tree functional composition and soil carbon stocks at 0-10 cm depth, whereby carbon stocks increased with the relative influence of light-demanding tree species. Light demanding trees had higher leaf nitrogen but lower leaf density than shade-tolerant trees, suggesting that rapid decomposition of nutrient-rich plant material in forests with a higher proportion of light-demanding species results in greater accumulation of carbon in the surface layer of soils. Synthesis. We propose that soil carbon storage in secondary tropical forests is more strongly linked to tree functional composition than forest age, and that the persistence of long-lived pioneer trees could enhance soil carbon storage as forests age. Considering shifts in tree functional groups could improve estimates of carbon sequestration potential for climate change mitigation by tropical forest regrowth.

In the African Highlands (AH) where conversion of forests to cultivation on steep slopes is leading to soil degradation, sustainable land management practices are vital. Farmers' awareness of soil health indicators (SHI) influences their choice of land management and needs to be better understood to improve communication between land managers and other stakeholders in agricultural systems. This study aims to collate and evaluate case study analyses of farmers' awareness and use of soil health indicators in African Highlands. This is achieved by using a multi-method approach that combines a meta-summary analysis of AH's SHI data from 24 published studies together with farmer interviews in the East Usambara Mountain region of Tanzania (EUM). Our findings show that farmers across the AH use observable attributes of the landscape as SHI. Out of 16 SHI reported by the farmers, vegetation performance/crop yield and soil colour were most frequently used across the AH. These were also the only two SHI that influenced farmers' land management decisions in the EUM, where organic manure addition was the only land management option resulting from observed changes in SHI. Farmers' use of only one or two SHI in land management decisions, as is the case in the EUM, seems to limit their choice and/or adoption of sustainable land management options, highlighting the need to increase awareness and use of more relevant SHI.

6089,pub.1136624227,10.1038/s41586-021-03306-8,33762765,,A trade-off between plant and soil carbon storage under elevated CO2,"Terrestrial ecosystems remove about 30 per cent of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by human activities each year1, yet the persistence of this carbon sink depends partly on how plant biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks respond to future increases in atmospheric CO2 (refs. 2,3). Although plant biomass often increases in elevated CO2 (eCO2) experiments4–6, SOC has been observed to increase, remain unchanged or even decline7. The mechanisms that drive this variation across experiments remain poorly understood, creating uncertainty in climate projections8,9. Here we synthesized data from 108 eCO2 experiments and found that the effect of eCO2 on SOC stocks is best explained by a negative relationship with plant biomass: when plant biomass is strongly stimulated by eCO2, SOC storage declines; conversely, when biomass is weakly stimulated, SOC storage increases. This trade-off appears to be related to plant nutrient acquisition, in which plants increase their biomass by mining the soil for nutrients, which decreases SOC storage. We found that, overall, SOC stocks increase with eCO2 in grasslands (8 ± 2 per cent) but not in forests (0 ± 2 per cent), even though plant biomass in grasslands increase less (9 ± 3 per cent) than in forests (23 ± 2 per cent). Ecosystem models do not reproduce this trade-off, which implies that projections of SOC may need to be revised.","We thank C. Körner, R. Norby, M. Schneider, K. Treseder, M.

However, it is still lack of a quantitative basis for predicting the functional stability of permafrost ecosystems in carbon (C) and nutrient cycling. We compiled the data of 708 observations from 89 air-warming experiments in the Northern Hemisphere and characterized the general effects of temperature increase on permafrost C exchange and balance, biomass production, microbial biomass, soil nutrients, and vegetation N dynamics through a meta-analysis. Also, an investigation was made on how responses might change with habitat-specific (e.g., plant functional groups and soil moisture status) conditions and warming variables (e.g., warming phases, levels, and timing). The net ecosystem C exchange (NEE) was found to be downregulated by warming as a result of a stronger sensitivity to warming in respiration (15.6%) than in photosynthesis (6.2%). Vegetation usually responded to warming by investing more C to the belowground, as belowground biomass increased much more (30.1%) than aboveground biomass (2.9%). Warming had a minor effect on microbial biomass. Warming increased soil ammonium and nitrate concentrations. What's more, a synthesis of 70 observations from 11 herbs and 9 shrubs revealed a 2.5% decline of N in green leaves. Compared with herbs, shrubs had a stronger response to respiration and had a decline in green leaf N to a greater extent. Not only in dry condition did green leaf N decline with warming but also in wet conditions. Warming in nongrowing seasons would negatively affect soil water, C uptake, and biomass production during growing seasons. Permafrost C loss and vegetation N decline may increase with warming levels and timing. Overall, these findings suggest that besides a positive C cycling-climate feedback, there will be a negative feedback between permafrost nutrient cycling and climate warming.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 32001209), the GDAS’ Project of Science and Technology Development (2019GDASYL‐0102002‐1), the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou (202002020072), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2019A1515011559), and Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talents (2017GC010570) as well as the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) Program (2019QZKK030) .

However, it remains poorly understood how microplastics impact soil nitrogen processes and generate N2O. A meta-analysis was conducted for this investigation based on 60 published studies to elucidate the effects of microplastics on soil nitrogen cycling, from genes to processes. Under microplastic exposure, the emissions of soil N2O was significantly increased (140.6%), while the nitrate reductase activities increased by 4.8%. The denitrification rate and number of denitrifier genes were increased by 17.8% and 10.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, the nitrification rate and nitrifier genes were not significantly altered, so did the nitrogen immobilization and mineralization rates. The additional emission of soil N2O might primarily from stimulated denitrification. Soil N2O emission and denitrification genes were always increased, regardless of the concentrations of microplastic or experiment duration. As a result, the nitrite was increased by 38.8% and nitrate was decreased by 22.4%, respectively. Interestingly, the N2O emission increments and copy number of denitrifiers genes diminished over time. This study revealed divergent changes in soil nitrogen processes and highlighted N2O emissions with a greater denitrification rate under microplastic exposure. The negative impacts of microplastics on soil health were revealed from the perspective of soil nitrogen availability and N2O emissions.","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (grant number 31972522), the Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program (grant number XLYC2007032), the Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2021-MS-149), the Scientific Research Fund of the Liaoning Provincial Education Department (grant number LQN202003), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (SWU-KR22019), the National Key Research and Development Project of China (grant number 2018YFC1801200), the Open Project of State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology (ES201809), the Open Research Fund of Key Laboratory of Wetland Ecology and Environment Research in Cold Regions of Heilongjiang Province (grant number 201903), the Major Science and Technology Project of Liaoning Province (grant number 2019JH1/10300001), the College Students&#x27; Innovative Entrepreneurial Training Plan Program.",,Journal of Hazardous Materials,,,Nitrous Oxide; Denitrification; Microplastics; Plastics; Nitrification; Soil; Nitrogen; Soil Microbiology,2022-12-01,2022,2022-12-01,2023-03,445,,130500,Closed,Article,"Su, Pinjie; Gao, Changyuan; Zhang, Xiaojing; Zhang, Dan; Liu, Xingyu; Xiang, Tingting; Luo, Yifu; Chu, Kuo; Zhang, Guohui; Bu, Naishun; Li, Zhaolei","Su, Pinjie (School of Environmental Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang 110036, China; Key Laboratory of Low-carbon Green Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, College of Resources and Environment, and Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.); Gao, Changyuan (School of Environmental Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang 110036, China.); Zhang, Xiaojing (School of Environmental Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang 110036, China.); Zhang, Dan (School of Environmental Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang 110036, China.); Liu, Xingyu (School of Environmental Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang 110036, China.); Xiang, Tingting (School of Environmental Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang 110036, China.); Luo, Yifu (School of Environmental Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang 110036, China.); Chu, Kuo (School of Environmental Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang 110036, China.); Zhang, Guohui (School of Environmental Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang 110036, China.); Bu, Naishun (School of Environmental Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang 110036, China; Institute for Carbon Neutrality, Liaoning University, Shenyang 110036, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Ecological Environment Protection and Livelihood Security, Water Source Protection Area of Liaoning Province, Shenyang 110036, China.

Yet, no previous study has integrated multiple research systems to quantitatively examine biochar-mediated GHGs emission reduction potential in CWs. Here we synthesized 114 studies to quantify biochar-induced declines ability of GHGs in the CWs by using the multi-level meta-analysis, reveal the variation of GHGs emission effect in different biochar-CWs and its response relationship with biochar, and identify the moderating variables that had a strong explanatory effect on the emission reduction effect of biochar. We showed that biochar remarkably affect CO2 mitigation (p < 0.05), but has insignificant and heterogeneous effects on CH4 and N2O. Pyrolysis time, influent dissolved oxygen (DO), influent NO3--N concentration, hydraulic retention time (HRT) and wetland type can significantly affect the effect of biochar on CH4 emission reduction. Particularly, the importance of HRT and wetland type was 0.89 and 0.85, respectively. Specially, the surface batch CWs modified by biochar could significantly promote the emission of CH4 (p < 0.001), and the effect size was up to 89.59. For N2O, biochar diameter, biochar addition ratio, influent COD/TN ratio, plant name, and removal efficiency of NO3--N/TN/COD were significant moderators. Among them, influent COD/TN ratio and plant name showed a stronger explanation. Planting Cyperus alternifolius L. significantly enhanced the N2O emission reduction capacity by biochar (p < 0.001), and effect size was as low as -24.32. 700-900 °C biochar can promote CH4 flux but inhibit N2O flux.

However, appropriate reclaimed water quality thresholds and farming practices to improve food crop yield is virtually unclear. Therefore, for the first time, this study made a large compilation of previous studies using meta-analysis combined with a random forest (RF) model and analyzed the impact of RW versus freshwater (FW) on the yield of food crops (cereals, vegetables, and fruits). It was found that magnesium ion (Mg2+), calcium ion (Ca2+), electrical conductivity (EC), total nitrogen (TN), and potential of hydrogen (pH) were the most important factors for RW quality indicators. Based on the results, water managers should establish more conservative RW quality thresholds to promote food crop production, especially for salts and pollutants in RW. Compared to international water quality standards, it could be slightly relaxed the restrictions of TN in RW. The optimal farming practices obtained that irrigation amount of the mixed RW and FW (RW + FW) was from 1000 m3 ha-1 to 5000 m3 ha-1, and the cultivation period was no more than three years. Flood irrigation (FI) and drip irrigation (DI) for cereals were also recommended. Finally, a comparison of the determined results from this method with other scenarios published, finding a good agreement.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52279044, 52079131).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Water Quality; Agricultural Irrigation; Random Forest; Wastewater; Agriculture,2022-12-10,2022,2022-12-10,2023-03,862,,160774,Closed,Article,"Liu, Xufei; Zhang, Lin; Yang, Fuhui; Zhou, Wei","Liu, Xufei (College of Water Resources and Architecture Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, PR China.); Zhang, Lin (Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, PR China.

Less is known about the individual effects of PM2.5 components. A population-based cohort study investigated the association between long-term (1-year average) exposure to PM2.5 components and dementia incidence among the elderly population (age, ≥65 years) in the United States. We used data from the Medicare Chronic Conditions Warehouse and a high-resolution PM2.5 components dataset of the northeastern United States (2000-2017). We identified dementia diagnoses from patients' hospital and medical insurance records and carried out Cox proportional hazards regression to investigate their association with PM2.5 components. Among ∼2 million participants, 15.1% developed dementia. From the single-pollutant models, hazard ratios per interquartile range increase were 1.10 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.11) for black carbon, 1.08 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.10) for inorganic nitrate, 1.03 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.04) for organic matter, 1.13 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.15) for sulfate, 1.07 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.07) for soil particles, and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.05) for sea salt. Increase in exposure to black carbon and sulfate per interquartile range had the strongest associations with dementia incidence. Penalized spline models indicated that dementia incidence increased linearly with elevated black carbon concentrations, whereas the incidence of dementia was only elevated significantly following sulfate concentrations above ∼2 μg/m3. Our study suggests that long-term exposure to PM2.5 components is significantly associated with increased dementia incidence and that different components have different neurotoxicity. Reduction of PM2.5 emissions, especially for main sources of black carbon and sulfate, may reduce the burden of dementia in the aging United States population.","This study was supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA/NIH R01 AG074357), the HERCULES Center (P30 ES019776) and the Goizueta Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease Research Center (ADRC) of Emory University (P50 AG025688), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (RD-835872), and NASA (80NSSC21K0508).",,The Innovation,,,,2022-01-17,2022,2022-01-17,2022-03,3,2,100208,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Jing; Wang, Yifan; Steenland, Kyle; Liu, Pengfei; van Donkelaar, Aaron; Martin, Randall V.; Chang, Howard H.; Caudle, W.

The rapid evolution of sequencing technologies has facilitated the generation of tremendous amounts of data on what taxa comprise belowground microbial assemblages, largely available as isolated datasets, offering an opportunity for synthesis research that informs progress on understanding Blue Carbon microbiomes. We identified questions that can be addressed with a synthesis approach, including the high variability across datasets, space, and time due to differing sampling techniques, ecosystem or vegetation specificity, and the relationship between microbiome community and edaphic properties, particularly soil carbon. To address these questions, we collated 34 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing datasets, including bulk soil or rhizosphere from seagrass, mangroves, and saltmarshes within publicly available repositories. We identified technical and theoretical challenges that precluded a synthesis of multiple studies with currently available data, and opportunities for addressing the knowledge gaps within Blue Carbon microbial ecology going forward. Here, we provide a standardisation toolbox that supports enacting tasks for the acquisition, management, and integration of Blue Carbon-associated sequencing data and metadata to potentially elucidate novel mechanisms behind Blue Carbon dynamics.",The authors are grateful to Ashley Bulseco for her help in data collection.,This research was funded by an Australian Research Council Discovery Project (DP200100575).

Although the effect of crop diversity on soil nitrogen-cycling microbes is mainly related to the influence of environmental factors, there is a lack of quantitative research. This study aims to determine the effect of diversified cropping mode on the abundance of functional genes in the soil nitrogen cycle based on the quantitative integration of a meta-analysis database containing 189 observation data pairs. The results show that the soil nifH (nitrogenase coding gene), nirS and nirK (nitrite reductase coding gene), and narG (nitrate reductase coding gene) abundances are positively affected by the diversity of plant species, whereas the amoA (ammonia monooxygenase coding gene) and nosZ (nitrous oxide reductase coding gene) show no response. Diversification duration and ecosystem type are important factors that regulate soil nitrogen fixation and nitrification gene abundances. Denitrification genes are mainly affected by categorical variables such as the planting pattern, soil layer, application species, duration, and soil texture. Among them, the long-term continuous diversification is mainly manifested in the reduction of soil nifH and increase of nirK abundances. Soil organic carbon and nitrogen linearly affect the responses of nifH, amoA, nirS, and nirK. Therefore, to maintain the soil ecological function, diversity of planting patterns needs to be applied flexibly by regulating the abundance of nitrogen-cycling genes. Our study draws conclusions in order to provide theoretical references for the sustainability of nitrogen and improvement of management measures in the process of terrestrial managed ecosystem diversification.","This work was supported by the project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number: 31971859], Shaanxi Innovation Capability Support Program [grant number: 2019PT-13], and Shaanxi Engineering Research Center of Circular Agriculture (2019HBGC-13).

Here, we conducted a worldwide meta-analysis using 1071 observation data concerning the effects of global change factors (GCFs), including warming (W), increased precipitation (PPT+), decreased precipitation (PPT-), elevated CO2 concentration (eCO2), and nitrogen deposition (N), to evaluate their individual, combined, and interactive effects on soil microbial properties across different groups and ecosystems. Across the dataset, eCO2 increased microbial richness and diversity by 40.5% and 4.6%, respectively; warming and N addition decreased the abundance of denitrification functional genes (nirS, nirK, and nozS); N addition had a greater impact on soil C-cycling functional genes than on N-cycling ones. Long-term precipitation change was conducive to the increase in soil microbial richness, and fungal richness change was more sensitive than bacterial richness, but the sensitivity of bacteria richness to N addition was positively correlated with experimental duration. Soil microbial richness, diversity, and functional gene abundances could be significantly affected by individual or multiple GCF changes, and their interactions are mainly additive. W×eCO2 on microbial diversity, and N×PPT+ and W×N on N-cycling functional gene abundance showed synergistic interactions. Based on the limitations of the collected data and the findings, we suggest designing experiments with multiple GCFs and long experimental durations and incorporating the effects and interactions of multiple drivers into ecosystem models to accurately predict future soil microbial properties and functions under future global changes.","We sincerely thank the authors whose work is included in this meta-analysis, and those who helped with the meta-analysis.

However, the effect of organic fertilizers on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the vegetable cropping system has been largely overlooked. In this study, we investigated the impacts of soil properties and biotic factors on ARG profiles by analyzing ARG and bacterial communities in vegetable copping soils with a long-term history of manure and bio-organic fertilizer application. The ARG abundance in the soil was significantly increased by 116% with manure application compared to synthetic NPK fertilizer application. This finding was corroborated by our meta-analysis that the longer the duration of manure application, the greater the response of increased soil ARG abundance. However, bio-organic fertilizers containing Trichoderma spp. Significantly reduced ARG contamination by 31% compared to manure application. About half of the ARG variation was explained by changes in bacterial abundance and structure, followed by soil properties. The mitigation of ARG by Trichoderma spp. Is achieved by altering the structure of the bacterial community and weakening the close association between bacteria and ARG prevalence. Taken together, these findings shed light on the contribution of bio-organic fertilizers in mitigating ARG contamination in agricultural soils, which can help manage the ecological risk posed by ARG inputs associated with manure application.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Moreover, we do not yet understand how the impact of MNPs is affected by experimental design and environmental conditions. Herein, we conducted a global analysis to synthesize the effects of MNPs on 17 variables associated with soil nitrogen (N) cycling from 62 studies. Our results showed that MNPs generally exerted inhibitory effects on N-cycling process rates, N-related enzyme activities, and microbial variables. The response of soil N cycling varied with MNP type, and exposure dose was the most decisive factor for the variations in the responses of N-cycling process rates and enzyme activities. Notably, Ag/Ag2 S and CuO had dose-dependent inhibitory effects on ammonia oxidation rates, while CuO and Zn/ZnO showed hormetic effects on nitrification and denitrification rates, respectively. Other experimental design factors (e.g., MNP size and exposure duration) also regulated the effect of MNPs on soil N cycling, and specific MNPs, such as Ag/Ag2 S, exerted stronger effects during long-term (>28 days) exposure. Environmental conditions, including soil pH, organic carbon, texture, and presence/absence of plants, significantly influenced MNP toxicity. For instance, the effects of Ag/Ag2 S on the ammonia oxidation rate and the activity of leucine aminopeptidase were more potent in acid (pH <6), organic matter-limited (organic carbon content ≤10 g kg-1 ), and coarser soils. Overall, these results provide new insights into the general mechanisms by which MNPs alter soil N processes in different environments and underscore the urgent need to perform multivariate and long-term in situ trials in simulated natural environments.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32022051 and 32030069) and the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2020CFA108).

Unsound management practices and climate change have resulted in widespread grassland degradation, providing open habitats for rodent activities. Rodent bioturbation loosens topsoil, reduces productivity, changes soil nutrient conditions, and consequently influences the soil organic carbon stocks of the Tibetan grasslands. However, these effects have not been quantified. Here, using meta-analysis and upscaling approaches, we found that rodent bioturbation impacts on the Tibetan grassland soil organic carbon contents were depth-dependent, with significant (P < 0.001) decreasing of 24.4% in the topsoil (0 to 10 cm) but significant (P < 0.05) increasing of 35.9% in the deeper soil layer (40 to 50 cm), and nonsignificant changes in other soil layers. The depth-dependent responses in soil organic carbon content were closely associated with rodent tunnel burrowing, foraging, excrement deposition, and mixing of the upper and deeper soil layers. Rodent bioturbation had shown nonsignificant impacts on soil bulk density, independent of soil layer. Tibetan grasslands totally lose -35.2 Tg C yr-1 (95% CI: -48.5 to -21.1 Tg C yr-1) and -32.9 Tg C yr-1 (-54.2 to -8.6 Tg C yr-1) due to rodent bioturbation in the 0 to 10 or 0 to 30 cm soil layer, while no significant net loss was found over the 0 to 90 cm layer. Our findings highlight the importance of considering depth-dependent factors to robustly quantify the net changes in the terrestrial soil organic carbon stocks resulting from disturbances such as rodent bioturbation.",We sincerely appreciate the researchers at all stations across the Tibetan grasslands for their work under the harsh climate and efforts to make their datasets publicly accessible.

We conducted a meta-analysis (100 data pairs) to generalize information about the microbial CUE response to N addition in soil based on the two most common CUE estimation approaches: (i) 13 C-labelled substrate addition (13 C-substrate) and (ii) 18 O-labelled water addition (18 O-H2 O). The mean microbial CUE in soils across all biomes and approaches was 0.37. The effects of N addition on CUE, however, were depended on the approach: CUE decreased by 12% if measured by the 13 C-substrate approach, while CUE increased by 11% if measured by the 18 O-H2 O approach. These differences in the microbial CUE response depending on the estimation approach are explained by the divergent reactions of microbial growth to N addition: N addition decreases the 13 C incorporation into microbial biomass (this parameter is in the numerator by CUE calculation based on the 13 C-substrate approach). In contrast, N addition slightly increases (although statistically insignificant) the microbial growth rate (in the numerator of the CUE calculation when assessed by the 18 O-H2 O approach), significantly raising the CUE. We explained these N addition effects based on CUE regulation mechanisms at the metabolic, cell, community, and ecosystem levels. Consequently, the differences in the microbial responses (microbial growth, respiration, C incorporation, community composition, and dormant or active states) between the 13 C-substrate and 18 O-H2 O approaches need to be considered. Thus, these two CUE estimation approaches should be compared to understand microbially mediated C and nutrient dynamics under increasing anthropogenic N input and other global change effects.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank all the researchers whose data were used in this meta‐analysis.

However, it is not well known how their effects on N leaching and runoff depend on application approaches. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 129 studies to compare the effects of organic inputs on N export via leaching and runoff. We compared three application approaches: chemical fertilizer N substituted by organic fertilizer with: 1) equal amounts of total N or, 2) equal amounts of mineral N and 3) additional organic fertilizer N on top of chemical fertilizer. The meta-analysis showed that organic inputs reduced overall N leaching and runoff by 15% and 29%, respectively, without compromising crop yield, and that this effect was significantly influenced by the application approach taken. Organic substitution of chemical fertilizer N with equal amounts of total N decreased both leaching and runoff by more than 30% and hardly affected crop yield. Substitution with equal amounts of mineral N generally increased crop yield by 6% but also increased N leaching by 21%. Organic inputs in addition to chemical fertilizer N did not affect leaching and runoff. The differences between application approaches were reinforced with increased treatment duration. The loss ratios of leaching and runoff were 14% and 4.5%, respectively, from chemical fertilizer, and 9.2% and 2.6%, respectively, from organic fertilizer. The optimal substitution rates differed between leaching (40-60%) and runoff (60-100%) when substitution was based on equal amounts of total N. We conclude that substitution of chemical for organic fertilizer at equal amounts of total N is most effective in reducing N export via leaching and runoff without compromising crop production.","We are grateful to Oene Oenema for providing some research ideas.

Beef and dairy contribute over 70% of livestock greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), which collectively contribute ~6.3 Gt CO2 -eq/year (Gerber et al., 2013; Herrero et al., 2016) and account for 14%-18% of human GHG emissions (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Gerber et al., 2013). The utility of beef GHG mitigation strategies, such as land-based carbon (C) sequestration and increased production efficiency, are actively debated (Garnett et al., 2017). We compiled 292 local comparisons of ""improved"" versus ""conventional"" beef production systems across global regions, assessing net GHG emission data from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. Our results indicate that net beef GHG emissions could be reduced substantially via changes in management. Overall, a 46 % reduction in net GHG emissions per unit of beef was achieved at sites using carbon (C) sequestration management strategies on grazed lands, and an 8% reduction in net GHGs was achieved at sites using growth efficiency strategies. However, net-zero emissions were only achieved in 2% of studies. Among regions, studies from Brazil had the greatest improvement, with management strategies for C sequestration and efficiency reducing beef GHG emissions by 57%. In the United States, C sequestration strategies reduced beef GHG emissions by over 100% (net-zero emissions) in a few grazing systems, whereas efficiency strategies were not successful at reducing GHGs, possibly because of high baseline efficiency in the region. This meta-analysis offers insight into pathways to substantially reduce beef production's global GHG emissions. Nonetheless, even if these improved land-based and efficiency management strategies could be fully applied globally, the trajectory of growth in beef demand will likely more than offset GHG emissions reductions and lead to further warming unless there is also reduced beef consumption.","We thank the Climate and Land Use Alliance and The Nature Conservancy for support, and D.

This critical and comprehensive review analyzes indicators and approaches to ""sustainable healthy diets"" published in the literature since this discipline's emergence a few years ago, identifying robust gauges and highlighting the flaws of the most commonly used models. The reviewed studies largely focus on one or two domains such as greenhouse gas emissions or water use, while overlooking potential impact shifts to other sectors or resources. The present study covers a comprehensive set of indicators from the health, environmental and socio-economic viewpoints. This assessment concludes that in order to identify the best food option in sustainability assessments and nutrition analysis of diets, some aspects such as the classification and disaggregation of food groups, the impacts of the rates of local food consumption and seasonality, preservation methods, agrobiodiversity and organic food and different production systems, together with consequences for low-income countries, require further analysis and consideration.",The authors are grateful for the administrative support of the IS-FOOD (Public University of Navarre).,"The project leading to these results has received funding from “la Caixa” and Caja Navarra Foundation, under agreement LCF/PR/PR13/51080004.",Foods,,Isabel Ferreira,,2021-05-02,2021,2021-05-02,,10,5,999,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aldaya, Maite M.; Ibañez, Francisco C.; Domínguez-Lacueva, Paula; Murillo-Arbizu, María Teresa; Rubio-Varas, Mar; Soret, Beatriz; Beriain, María José","Aldaya, Maite M.

However, evidence on the effects of its constituents on obesity has not been explored.
METHODS: Using multistage stratified cluster sampling, we enrolled 41,439 school-age children (aged 6-17 years) from a representative nationwide survey of 30 provinces in China (mean age ± standard deviation: 12.0 ± 3.3 years). Weight and height were measured using a physician beam scale with a height rod, and covariates were determined using a standard questionnaire. The concentration of PM2.5 chemical constituents was estimated by a chemical transport (GEOS-Chem) model using input satellite data and ground-based observations. The constituents included black carbon, ammonium, nitrate, organic matter, sulfate, and soil dust. Generalized linear models were used to estimate the association between the chemical constituents of PM2.5 and obesity.
RESULTS: A positive association between the constituents of PM2.5 and obesity were observed. Children were more susceptible to black carbon than other species. A 1-μg/m3 increase in black carbon led to a 0.079 (95 % confidence interval [CI]:0.028, 0.130)-kg/m2 increase in body mass index (BMI). This also increased the odds of being obese and overweight to 1.174 (95 % CI: 1.111, 1.240) and 1.165 (95 % CI: 1.116, 1.216), respectively. Stratified analyses showed that the effects were stronger in girls and older children, as well as in urban and Northeast regions. The effect of the PM2.5 constituents on obese and overweight children from urban areas significantly interacted with that of rural areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The PM2.5 constituents were associated with an increased BMI and childhood obesity. Further studies are warranted to validate these results and clarify their potential mechanisms. We suggest focusing on black carbon and Northeast regions.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no conflict of actual or potential financial interests.

Additionally, the corresponding details of soil C cycles in response to altered precipitation regimes have not been well documented. Here, a meta-analysis was performed using 845 pairwise observations (control vs. increased or decreased precipitation) from 214 published articles to quantify the responses of the input process of exogenous C, the contents of various forms of C in soil, and the soil-atmosphere C fluxes relative to increased or decreased precipitation. The results showed that the effects of altered precipitation regimes did not differ between rainfall and snowfall. Increased precipitation significantly enhanced the soil C inputs, pools and outputs by 18.17%, 18.50%, and 21.04%, respectively, while decreased precipitation led to a significant decline in these soil C parameters by 10.18%, 9.96%, and 17.98%, respectively. The effects of increased precipitation on soil C cycles were more significant in arid areas (where mean annual precipitation, MAP <500 mm), but the effects of decreased precipitation were more significant in humid areas (where MAP ≥500 mm), indicating that the original MAP partially determined the responses of the soil C cycles to altered precipitation regimes. This study implies that for the same of precipitation variation, soil C cycles respond at different magnitudes: not only should the direction (decrease vs. increase) be counted but also the region (arid vs. humid) should be considered. These results deepened our understanding on regional differentiation in soil C cycles under climate change scenarios.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank authors of all referenced papers for providing the original information as well as the reviewers for their comments and suggestions.

The interaction between living and non-living constituents of the environment is important for the regulation of life in the ecosystem. Biochar is a carbon rich product present in the soil that is responsible for various applications in diversified fields. In this review, we focused on the collaboration between the soil, biochar and microbial community present in the soil and consequences of it in the ecosystem. Herein, it primarily discusses on the different approaches of the production and characterization of biochar. Furthermore, this review also discusses about the optimistic interaction of biochar with soil microbes and their role in plant growth. Eventually, it reveals the various physio-chemical properties of biochar, including its specific surface area, porous nature, ion exchange capacity, and pH, which aid in the modification of the soil environment. Furthermore, it elaborately discloses the impact of the biochar addition in the soil focusing mainly on its interaction with microbial communities such as bacteria and fungi. The physicochemical properties of biochar significantly interact with microbes and improve the beneficial microbes growth and increase soil nutrients, which resulting reasonable plant growth. The main focus remains on the role of biochar-soil microbiota in remediation of pollutants, soil amendment and inhibition of pathogenicity among plants by promoting resistance potential. It highlights the fact that adding biochar to soil modulates the soil microbial community by increasing soil fertility, paving the way for its use in farming, and pollutant removal.","The authors would like to thank Van Lang University, Vietnam for funding this work.",,Environmental Research,,,Charcoal; Microbiota; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants,2022-07-08,2022,2022-07-08,2022-11,214,Pt 2,113832,Closed,Article,"Tan, Shimeng; Narayanan, Mathiyazhagan; Thu Huong, Dinh Thi; Ito, Nobutaka; Unpaprom, Yuwalee; Pugazhendhi, Arivalagan; Lan Chi, Nguyen Thuy; Liu, Junang","Tan, Shimeng (College of Biological Science and Technology, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China; College of Forestry, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China.); Narayanan, Mathiyazhagan (Division of Research and Innovation, Department of Biotechnology, Saveetha School of Engineering, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Science, Chennai, 602 105, Tamil Nadu, India.); Thu Huong, Dinh Thi (School of Engineering and Technology, Van Lang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.); Ito, Nobutaka (School of Renewable Energy, Maejo University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.); Unpaprom, Yuwalee (Program in Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, Maejo University, Chiangmai, Thailand.); Pugazhendhi, Arivalagan (Emerging Materials for Energy and Environmental Applications Research Group, School of Engineering and Technology, Van Lang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.

The Role of Animal-Source Foods in Healthy and Environmentally Sustainable Diets,"Scientific and political discussions around the role of animal-source foods (ASFs) in healthy and environmentally sustainable diets are often polarizing. To bring clarity to this important topic, we critically reviewed the evidence on the health and environmental benefits and risks of ASFs, focusing on primary trade-offs and tensions, and summarized the evidence on alternative proteins and protein-rich foods. ASFs are rich in bioavailable nutrients commonly lacking globally and can make important contributions to food and nutrition security. Many populations in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia could benefit from increased consumption of ASFs through improved nutrient intakes and reduced undernutrition. Where consumption is high, processed meat should be limited, and red meat and saturated fat should be moderated to lower noncommunicable disease risk-this could also have cobenefits for environmental sustainability. ASF production generally has a large environmental impact; yet, when produced at the appropriate scale and in accordance with local ecosystems and contexts, ASFs can play an important role in circular and diverse agroecosystems that, in certain circumstances, can help restore biodiversity and degraded land and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from food production. The amount and type of ASF that is healthy and environmentally sustainable will depend on the local context and health priorities and will change over time as populations develop, nutritional concerns evolve, and alternative foods from new technologies become more available and acceptable. Efforts by governments and civil society organizations to increase or decrease ASF consumption should be considered in light of the nutritional and environmental needs and risks in the local context and, importantly, integrally involve the local stakeholders impacted by any changes. Policies, programs, and incentives are needed to ensure best practices in production, curb excess consumption where high, and sustainably increase consumption where low.","Acknowledgments We thank Gil B Carvalho for feedback on a draft version of this manuscript.

However, the effect of substituting synthetic fertilizer with organic fertilizer on vegetable productivity (yield, N uptake and nitrogen use efficiency) and reactive nitrogen (Nr) losses (N2O emission, N leaching and NH3 volatilization) remains unclear. A meta-analysis was performed using peer-reviewed papers published from 2000 to 2019 to comprehensively assess the effects of combined application of organic and synthetic N fertilizers. The results indicate that overall, the vegetable yield, N2O emission and NH3 volatilization were not significantly changed, whereas N leaching was reduced by 44.6% and soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration increased by 12.5% compared to synthetic N fertilizer alone. Specifically, when synthetic N substitution rates (SRs) were ≤70%, vegetable yields and SOC concentration were increased by 5.5%-5.6% and 13.1-18.0%, and N leaching was reduced by 41.6%-48.1%. At the high substitution rate (SR>70%), vegetable yield was reduced by 13.6%, N2O emission was reduced by 14.3%, and SOC concentration increased by 16.4%. Mixed animal-plant sources of organic N preferentially increased vegetable yield and SOC concentration, and reduced N2O emission and N leaching compared with single sources of organic-N. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission was decreased by 28.4%-34.9% by combined applications of organic and synthetic N sources, relative to synthetic N fertilizer alone. We conclude that appropriate rates (SR ≤ 70%) of combined applications of organic and synthetic N fertilizers could improve vegetable yields, decrease Nr and GHG emission, and facilitate sustainable development of coupled vegetable-livestock systems.","The authors would like to thank the National Key RD Program of China (No. 2017YFD0800403), and State Cultivation Base of Eco-agriculture for Southwest Mountainous Land, Southwest University.",,Environmental Pollution,,,Agriculture; Animals; Carbon; China; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Vegetables,2020-11-23,2020,2020-11-23,2021-01,269,,116143,Closed,Article,"Liu, Bin; Wang, Xiaozhong; Ma, Lin; Chadwick, Dave; Chen, Xinping","Liu, Bin (College of Resources and Environment, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, China; Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, China.); Wang, Xiaozhong (College of Resources and Environment, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, China; Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Efficient Utilization of Soil and Fertilizer Resources, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, China.); Ma, Lin (Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, China; Key Laboratory of Agricultural Water Resources, Center for Agricultural Resources Research, Institute of Genetic and Developmental Biology, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, 286 Huaizhong Road, Shijiazhuang, 050021, Hebei, China.); Chadwick, Dave (Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, China; School of Natural Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, LL57 2UW, UK.); Chen, Xinping (College of Resources and Environment, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, China; Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Efficient Utilization of Soil and Fertilizer Resources, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, China.

Here we performed a global meta-analysis with over 2,000 observations to determine whether a precision compost strategy (PCS) that aligns suitable composts and application methods with target crops and growth environments can advance sustainable food production. Eleven key predictors of compost (carbon-to-nutrient ratios, pH and salt content electric conductivity), management (nitrogen N supply) and biophysical settings (crop type, soil texture, soil organic carbon, pH, temperature and rainfall) determined 80% of the effect on crop yield, soil organic carbon and nitrous oxide emissions. The benefits of a PCS are more pronounced in drier and warmer climates and soils with acidic pH and sandy or clay texture, achieving up to 40% higher crop yield than conventional practices. Using a data-driven approach, we estimate that a global PCS can increase the production of major cereal crops by 96.3 Tg annually, which is 4% of current production. A global PCS has the technological potential to restore 19.5 Pg carbon in cropland topsoil (0–20 cm), equivalent to 26.5% of current topsoil soil organic carbon stocks. Together, this points to a central role of PCS in current and emerging agriculture.","This work was financially supported by National Key Technologies R&amp;D Program of China (grant 2016YFD0201303), Green and High-efficiency Fertilizer Innovation Program, Academy of Green Intelligent Compound Fertilizer, CNSIG Anhui Hongsifang Fertilizer Co., Ltd. and Chaohu Lake Non-point Source Pollution Key Technology Research, Construction of agricultural carbon neutrality account in Quzhou City, Zhejiang Province, Agricultural Technology Experiment Demonstration and Service Support Program in 2021, Graduate International Training Program of China Agricultural University, and the ‘Fight Food Waste Cooperative Research Centre’ under funding received from Australian Government’s Cooperative Research Centre Program.",,Nature Food,,,,2022-09-05,2022,2022-09-05,2022-09,3,9,741-752,Closed,Article,"Zhao, Shuaixiang; Schmidt, Susanne; Gao, Hongjian; Li, Tingyu; Chen, Xinping; Hou, Yong; Chadwick, Dave; Tian, Jing; Dou, Zhengxia; Zhang, Weifeng; Zhang, Fusuo","Zhao, Shuaixiang (College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, National Academy of Agriculture Green Development, Key Laboratory of Plant–Soil Interactions, Ministry of Education, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China); Schmidt, Susanne (School of Agriculture and Food Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia); Gao, Hongjian (College of Resources and Environmental Science, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China); Li, Tingyu (Sanya Nanfan Research Institute of Hainan University, Hainan University, Sanya, China); Chen, Xinping (College of Resources and Environment, and Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, Southwest University, Chongqing, China); Hou, Yong (College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, National Academy of Agriculture Green Development, Key Laboratory of Plant–Soil Interactions, Ministry of Education, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China); Chadwick, Dave (School of Natural Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, UK); Tian, Jing (College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, National Academy of Agriculture Green Development, Key Laboratory of Plant–Soil Interactions, Ministry of Education, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China); Dou, Zhengxia (Center for Animal Health and Productivity, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Kennett Square, PA, USA); Zhang, Weifeng (College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, National Academy of Agriculture Green Development, Key Laboratory of Plant–Soil Interactions, Ministry of Education, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China); Zhang, Fusuo (College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, National Academy of Agriculture Green Development, Key Laboratory of Plant–Soil Interactions, Ministry of Education, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China)","Zhang, Weifeng (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China)","Zhao, Shuaixiang (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China); Schmidt, Susanne (University of Queensland); Gao, Hongjian (Anhui Agricultural University); Li, Tingyu (Hainan University); Chen, Xinping (Southwest University); Hou, Yong (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China); Chadwick, Dave (Bangor University); Tian, Jing (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China); Dou, Zhengxia (University of Pennsylvania); Zhang, Weifeng (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China); Zhang, Fusuo (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China)",14,14,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150761032,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3002 Agriculture, Land and Farm Management; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production",2 Zero Hunger

Using a decade-long fertilisation experiment in a boreal larch forest (Larix gmelini) in northeast China, we found that the effects of N additions on Rs showed a temporal shift from a positive effect in the short-term (increased by 8% on average in the first year) to a negative effect over the longer term (decreased by 21% on average in the 11th year). The rates of decrease in Rs for the higher N levels were almost twice as high as those of the low N level. Our results suggest that the reduction in Rs in response to increased N input is accelerated by high-level N additions, and experimental high N applications are likely to overestimate the contribution of N deposition to soil carbon sequestration in a boreal forest.","This study is supported by the Basic Science Center Program (31988102), the National Key Research and Development Program (2017YFC0503901), and the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (QYZDY‐SSW‐SMC011).

Several conservation methods have been widely adopted in order to reduce runoff and protect the soil from erosion. The effectiveness of such conservation practices are controlled by many factors (i.e., climate, topography, soil properties, land use). To understand their efficiency and their trade-off, we conducted a meta-analysis by collecting 98 research articles within the time frame of 1981-2021, considering the most widespread soil and water conservation practices all over the world. The results exhibited that most of the conservation practices are useful in controlling soil erosion as compared to the runoff rate in which Hedgerow practice was found to be the most effective measure in controlling runoff rate (57 %) while no-tillage was proved to be the most efficient in reducing soil erosion (83 %). On the other hand, strip cropping showed a balanced runoff reduction efficiency (RRE) and soil erosion reduction efficiency (SERE), both reaching around 65 %, followed by hedgerow (59 % and 52 %) and mulching (51 % and 60 %). The results were restrained by varying climatic and physical scenarios.

However, a systematic investigation of the impact of non-native plant invasion on GHG dynamics at a global scale has not yet been conducted, making it impossible to predict the exact biological feedback of non-native plant invasion to global climate change. Here, we compiled 273 paired observational cases from 94 peer-reviewed articles to evaluate the effects of plant invasion on GHG emissions and to identify the associated key drivers. Non-native plant invasion significantly increased methane (CH4 ) emissions from 129 kg CH4 ha-1  year-1 in natural wetlands to 217 kg CH4 ha-1  year-1 in invaded wetlands. Plant invasion showed a significant tendency to increase CH4 uptakes from 2.95 to 3.64 kg CH4 ha-1  year-1 in terrestrial ecosystems. Invasive plant species also significantly increased nitrous oxide (N2 O) emissions in grasslands from an average of 0.76 kg N2 O ha-1  year-1 in native sites to 1.35 kg N2 O ha-1  year-1 but did not affect N2 O emissions in forests or wetlands. Soil organic carbon, mean annual air temperature (MAT), and nitrogenous deposition (N_DEP) were the key factors responsible for the changes in wetland CH4 emissions due to plant invasion. The responses of terrestrial CH4 uptake rates to plant invasion were mainly driven by MAT, soil NH4 + , and soil moisture. Soil NO3 - , mean annual precipitation, and N_DEP affected terrestrial N2 O emissions in response to plant invasion. Our meta-analysis not only sheds light on the stimulatory effects of plant invasion on GHG emissions from wetland and terrestrial ecosystems but also improves our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the responses of GHG emissions to plant invasion.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We appreciate various authors and organizations for their contributions to the data used in this meta‐analysis.

Degradation and restoration of alpine grassland are related to ecosystem function and production, livelihood, and wellbeing of local people. Although a large number of studies research degraded alpine grassland, there are debates about degradation patterns of alpine grassland in different areas and widely applicable ecological restoration schemes due to the huge area of the QTP. In this study, we used the meta-analysis method to synthesize 80 individual published studies which were conducted to examine aboveground and underground characteristics in non-degradation (ND), light degradation (LD), moderate degradation (MD), heavy degradation (HD), and extreme degradation (ED) of alpine grassland on the QTP. Results showed that aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), Shannon-Wiener index (H'), soil moisture (SM), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (TN), and available nitrogen (AN) gradually decreased along the degradation gradient, whereas soil bulk density (BD) and soil pH gradually increased. In spite of a tendency to soil desertification, losses of other soil nutrients and reduction of enzymes, there was no linear relationship between the variations with degradation gradient. Moreover, the decreasing extent of TN was smaller in areas with higher precipitation and temperature, and the decreasing extent of AGB, SOC, and TN was larger in areas with a higher extent of corresponding variables in the stage of ND during alpine grassland degradation. These findings suggest that in areas with higher precipitation and temperature, reseeding and sward cleavage can be used for restoration on degraded alpine grassland. Fencing and fertilization can be used for alpine grassland restoration in areas with lower precipitation and temperature. Microbial enzymes should not be used to restore degraded alpine grassland on a large scale on the QTP without detailed investigation and analysis. Future studies should pay more attention to the effects of climate factors on degradation processes and specific ecological restoration strategies in different regions of the QTP.",The authors thank all people for helping us to complete data collection and the reviewers who helped us to improve the manuscript.,"This study was supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP), grant no. 2019QZKK0402, and the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, grant no.

Yet a central question in microbial ecology remains unanswered: to what extent does the taxonomic composition of soil microbial communities mediate biogeochemical process rates? In this quantitative review, we explore the mechanisms that lead to variation in the strength of microbial community structure-function relationships over space and time. To evaluate these mechanisms, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies that have monitored the decomposition of sterilized plant litter inoculated with different microbial assemblages. We find that the influence of microbial community composition on litter decay is pervasive and strong, rivalling in magnitude the influence of litter chemistry on decomposition. However, no single environmental or experimental attribute was correlated with variation in the inoculum effect. These results emphasize the need to better understand ecological dynamics within microbial communities, particularly emergent features such as cross-feeding networks, to improve predictions of soil biogeochemical function.","Author contributions BGW conceptualized and designed the study.

The application of plant biostimulants (PBs) is one of the methods that step forward to address these challenges. The advantages of PBs have been reported numerous times. Yet, there is a general lack of quantitative assessment of the overall impact of PBs on crop production. Here we report a comprehensive meta-analysis on biostimulants (focus on non-microbial PBs) of over one thousand pairs of open-field data in a total of 180 qualified studies worldwide. Yield gains in open-field cultivation upon biostimulant application were compared across different parameters: biostimulant category, application method, crop species, climate condition, and soil property. The overall results showed that (1) the add-on yield benefit among all biostimulant categories is on average 17.9% and reached the highest potential via soil treatment; (2) biostimulant applied in arid climates and vegetable cultivation had the highest impact on crop yield; and (3) biostimulants were more efficient in low soil organic matter content, non-neutral, saline, nutrient-insufficient, and sandy soils. This systematic review provides general biostimulant application guidelines and gives consultants and growers insights into achieving an optimal benefit from biostimulant application.","We thank Ms. Halimat Ogunsanya, Ms. Brechtje de Haas, Dr. Hoang Khai Trinh (HortiCell Lab, Ghent University) for their critical comments and suggestions.","This research was supported by Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek – Vlaanderen (FWO) under project Bio2Bio (S006017N) and under project BioSUNmulant by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement of sustainable and resilient agriculture for food and non-food systems (FACCE SURPLUS, No. 652615) and with Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship (VLAIO) (HBC.2019.2244).

Biochar is one of the most widely used remediation agents for soil metal pollution. However, the literature does not provide a consistent picture of the performance of biochar on the immobilization of anionic metal(loid)s, especially arsenic, in soil. To obtain a baseline understanding on the interactions of metals and biochar, 597 data records on four metal(loid)s (As, Cr, Sb and V) were collected from 70 publications for this meta-analysis, and the results are highlighted below. Biochar has a significant immobilization effect on anionic metal(loid)s in soil and reduces the bioavailability of these metals to plants. Subgroup analysis found that biochar could decrease the potential mobility of Cr, Sb and V, but the immobilization effect on As was not always consistent. Meanwhile, biochar pH and soil pH are the most key factors affecting the immobilization effect. To summarize, biochar can effectively immobilize Cr, Sb and V in soil, but more attention should be given to As immobilization in future applications. By regulating the properties of biochar and appropriate modification, anionic metal(loid)s in soil can be immobilized more effectively. Hence, both of the soil quality and crop quality can be improved.",This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFC1808703).,,Journal of Hazardous Materials,,,"Charcoal; Machine Learning; Metals; Metals, Heavy; Soil; Soil Pollutants",2022-06-23,2022,2022-06-23,2022-09,438,,129442,Closed,Article,"Zhang, Yinjie; Ren, Meng; Tang, Yiming; Cui, Xuedan; Cui, Jun; Xu, Congbin; Qie, Hantong; Tan, Xiao; Liu, Dongpo; Zhao, Jiashun; Wang, Shuguang; Lin, Aijun","Zhang, Yinjie (College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China.); Ren, Meng (College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China.); Tang, Yiming (College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China.); Cui, Xuedan (College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China.); Cui, Jun (College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China.); Xu, Congbin (College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.); Qie, Hantong (College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China.); Tan, Xiao (College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China.); Liu, Dongpo (College of Ecological Environment, Institute of Disaster Prevention, Hebei 065201, China.); Zhao, Jiashun (College of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, North China Institute of Science and Technology, Hebei 065201, China.); Wang, Shuguang (College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China.

Increasing reactive nitrogen (N) in ecosystems caused by anthropogenic N input substantially affects SOC dynamics. However, uncertainties remain concerning the effects of N addition on SOC in both organic and mineral soil layers over time at the global scale. Here, we analysed a large empirical data set spanning 60 years across 369 sites worldwide to explore the temporal dynamics of SOC to N addition. We found that N addition significantly increased SOC across the globe by 4.2% (2.7%-5.8%). SOC increases were amplified from short- to long-term N addition durations in both organic and mineral soil layers. The positive effects of N addition on SOC were independent of ecosystem types, mean annual temperature and precipitation. Our findings suggest that SOC increases largely resulted from the enhanced plant C input to soils coupled with reduced C loss from decomposition and amplification was associated with reduced microbial biomass and respiration under long-term N addition. Our study suggests that N addition will enhance SOC sequestration over time and contribute to future climate change mitigation.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study is funded by the National Science Foundation of China (31700376), the Natural Science Key Fund for Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province of China (17KJA180006), the Six Talent Peaks Program of Jiangsu Province (JY‐041&amp; TD‐XYDXX‐006), the “5151” Talent Program of Nanjing Forestry University, and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).

Operationalization of these promising concepts is still lacking and potential trade-offs are often not considered in the current continental- to global-scale assessments. Here we discuss the effect of spatial variability in the context of the implementation of climate-smart practices on two central indicators, namely yield development and carbon sequestration, considering biophysical limitations of suggested benefits, socioeconomic and institutional barriers to adoption, and feedback mechanisms across scales. We substantiate our arguments by an illustrative analysis using the example of a hypothetical large-scale adoption of conservation agriculture (CA) in sub-Saharan Africa. We argue that, up to now, large-scale assessments widely neglect the spatially variable effects of climate-smart practices, leading to inflated statements about co-benefits of agricultural production and climate change mitigation potentials. There is an urgent need to account for spatial variability in assessments of climate-smart practices and target those locations where synergies in land functions can be maximized in order to meet the global targets. Therefore, we call for more attention toward spatial planning and landscape optimization approaches in the operationalization of CSA and SI to navigate potential trade-offs.",The research was funded by the European Research Council under the European Union&#x27;s Seventh Framework Programme ERC grant agreement no. 311819 (GLOLAND) and the SNF project SIPATH.

We conducted a meta-analysis to address key questions including, how plants respond to SEs under different environmental conditions, what is the accumulation potential of SEs in distinct plant families, and associated daily dietary intake risks to humans. Based on 517 endpoints, we revealed that various crop species show a heterogeneous response to SEs types (n = 140), SEs concentrations (n = 141), and exposure medium (n = 166). A subsidy-stress response was observed in terms of SEs accumulation for plant growth. The bioaccumulation of SE in plants was shown to be greatest in sand, followed by soil, and hydroponic media. Plants exposed to SEs exhibit considerable changes in physiological and biochemical characteristics. Surprisingly, food crops such as carrot and potato were found as major source of SEs daily intake in food chain but their consequences remains largely unknown. Further field-oriented research is needed to unveil the threshold levels for SEs in soil-plant systems as it may pose a global threat to human health. The state of knowledge presented here may guide towards urgently needed future investigations in this field for reducing the risk in SEs in agro-food systems.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the association between specific PM2.5 components and PD first hospitalization, a surrogate for disease aggravation.
METHODS: We obtained data on hospitalizations from the New York Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (2000-2014) to calculate annual first PD hospitalization counts in New York State per county. We used well-validated prediction models at 1 km2 resolution to estimate county level population-weighted annual black carbon (BC), organic matter (OM), nitrate, sulfate, sea salt (SS), and soil particle concentrations. We then used a multi-pollutant mixed quasi-Poisson model with county-specific random intercepts to estimate rate ratios (RR) of one-year exposure to each PM2.5 component and PD disease aggravation. We evaluated potential nonlinear exposure-outcome relationships using penalized splines and accounted for potential confounders.
RESULTS: We observed a total of 197,545 PD first hospitalizations in NYS from 2000 to 2014. The annual average count per county was 212 first hospitalizations. The RR (95% confidence interval) for PD aggravation was 1.06 (1.03, 1.10) per one standard deviation (SD) increase in nitrate concentrations and 1.06 (1.04, 1.09) for the corresponding increase in OM concentrations. We also found a nonlinear inverse association between PD aggravation and BC at concentrations above the 96th percentile.

CONCLUSION: In this study, we detected associations between the PM2.5 components OM and nitrate with PD disease aggravation. Our findings support that PM2.5 adverse effects on PD may vary by particle composition.","NIEHS R21 ES028472, R01 ES028805, P30 ES000002, P30 ES009089, NIA R01 AG066793, Training grants: T32 ES007322, and T32 ES007142.",,Environmental Research,,,Air Pollution; Humans; New York; Parkinson Disease; Particulate Matter,2021-06-25,2021,2021-06-25,2021-10,201,,111554,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Nunez, Yanelli; Boehme, Amelia K; Li, Maggie; Goldsmith, Jeff; Weisskopf, Marc G; Re, Diane B; Navas-Acien, Ana; van Donkelaar, Aaron; Martin, Randall V; Kioumourtzoglou, Marianthi-Anna","Nunez, Yanelli (Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, USA.

The role of livestock in supporting human well-being is especially contentious in discourses around sustainable diets. There is considerable variation in which environmental metrics are measured when describing sustainable diets, although some estimate of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of different diets based on varying assumptions is commonplace. A market for animal-free and manufactured food items to substitute for animal source food (ASF) has emerged, driven by the high GHG emissions of ASF. Ingredients sourced from plants, and animal cells grown in culture are two approaches employed to produce alternative meats. These can be complemented with ingredients produced using synthetic biology. Alternative meat companies promise to reduce GHG, the land and water used for food production, and reduce or eliminate animal agriculture. Some CEOs have even claimed alternative meats will 'end world hunger'. Rarely do such self-proclamations emanate from scientists, but rather from companies in their efforts to attract venture capital investment and market share. Such declarations are reminiscent of the early days of the biotechnology industry. At that time, special interest groups employed fear-based tactics to effectively turn public opinion against the use of genetic engineering to introduce sustainability traits, like disease resistance and nutrient fortification, into global genetic improvement programs. These same groups have recently turned their sights on the 'unnaturalness' and use of synthetic biology in the production of meat alternatives, leaving agriculturists in a quandary. Much of the rationale behind alternative meats invokes a simplistic narrative, with a primary focus on GHG emissions, ignoring the nutritional attributes and dietary importance of ASF, and livelihoods that are supported by grazing ruminant production systems. Diets with low GHG emissions are often described as sustainable, even though the nutritional, social and economic pillars of sustainability are not considered. Nutritionists, geneticists, and veterinarians have been extremely successful at developing new technologies to reduce the environmental footprint of ASF. Further technological developments are going to be requisite to continuously improve the efficiency of animal source, plant source, and cultured meat production. Perhaps there is an opportunity to collectively communicate how innovations are enabling both alternative- and conventional-meat producers to more sustainably meet future demand. This could counteract the possibility that special interest groups who promulgate misinformation, fear and uncertainty, will hinder the adoption of technological innovations to the ultimate detriment of global food security.","Acknowledgements We acknowledge Maci Mueller for the preparation of Fig. 7.

The goal of our study is to summarize the impacts of O3 on physiology, growth, yield, and quality of soybean, as well as root parameters. We performed meta-analysis on the collated 48 peer-reviewed papers published between 1980 and 2019 to quantitatively summarize the response of soybean to elevated O3 concentrations ([O3]). Relative to charcoal-filtered air (CF), elevated [O3] significantly accelerated chlorophyll degradation, enhanced foliar injury, and inhibited growth of soybean, evidenced by great reductions in leaf area (-20.8%), biomass of leaves (-13.8%), shoot (-22.8%), and root (-16.9%). Shoot of soybean was more sensitive to O3 than root in case of biomass. Chronic ozone exposure of about 75.5 ppb posed pronounced decrease in seed yield of soybean (-28.3%). In addition, root environment in pot contributes to higher reduction in shoot biomass and yield of soybean. Negative linear relationships were observed between yield loss and intensity of O3 treatment, AOT40. The larger loss in seed yield was significantly associated with higher reduction in shoot biomass and other yield component. This meta-analysis demonstrates the effects of elevated O3 on soybean were pronounced, suggesting that O3 pollution is still a soaring threat to the productivity of soybean in regions with high ozone levels.","We are grateful to Dr. Guofang Liu for his technical support for the data analysis.

Based on a cross-sectional investigation in China, we analyzed the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and its major components with elevated blood pressure in children and adolescents. A representative sample (N = 37,610) of children and adolescents with age 7-18 years was collected in seven Chinese provinces. Exposures to PM2.5 and five of its major components, including black carbon (BC), organic matter (OM), inorganic nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO42-), and soil particles (SOIL), were estimated using satellite-based spatiotemporal models. The associations between long-term exposures to PM2.5 and its components and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and hypertension were investigated using mixed-effects logistic and linear regression models. Within the populations, 11.5 % were classified as hypertension. After adjusting for a variety of covariates, per interquartile range (IQR) increment in PM2.5 mass and BC levels were significantly associated with a higher hypertension prevalence with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.56 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 2.25) for PM2.5 and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.35) for BC. Long-term exposures to PM2.5 and BC have also been associated with elevated SBP and DBP. Additionally, OM and NO3- were significantly associated with increased SBP, while SOIL was significantly associated with increased DBP. In the subgroup analysis, the associations between long-term exposures to BC and blood pressure vary significantly by urbanicity of residential area and diet habits. Our study suggests that long-term exposure to PM2.5 mass and specific PM2.5 components, especially for BC, are significantly associated with elevated blood pressure and a higher hypertension prevalence in Chinese children and adolescents.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Many studies have previously reported on direct effects of AR or its depositional substances on plant injury and performance. However, few studies have addressed the indirect effects of AR on plants as mediated by soil microorganisms and the abiotic environment of the soil rhizosphere. The indirect effects (e.g., AR → soil microorganisms→plants) need greater attention, because acidic deposition not only affects the distribution, composition, abundance, function, and activity of plant-associated microorganisms, but also influences the dynamics of some substances in the soil in a way that may be harmful to plants. Therefore, this review not only focused on the direct effects of AR on plant performance, growth, and biomass allocations from a whole-plant perspective, but also addressed the pathway of AR-soil chemical characteristics-plants, which explains how soil solute leaching and acidification by AR will reduce the availability of essential nutrients and increase the availability of heavy metals for plants, affecting carbon and nitrogen cycles. Mainly, we evaluated the AR-soil microorganisms-plants pathway by: 1) synthesizing the potential roles of soil microbes in alleviating soil acidic stress on plants and the adverse effects of AR on plant-associated soil microorganisms; 2) exploring how plant mycorrhizal types affect the detection of AR effect on plants. The meta-analysis showed that the effects of AR-induced pH on leaf chlorophyll content, plant height, and plant root biomass were dependent on plant mycorrhizal types. Some possible reasons for different synergy between mycorrhizal symbiotic types and plants were discussed. Future research relating to the effects of AR on plants should focus on the combined direct and indirect effects to evaluate how AR affects plant performance comprehensively.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Conservation agriculture (CA), which favours minimum soil disturbance, crop residue retention and crop diversification could be a viable alternative to the TA to address most of those major problems. With that in mind, a long-term experiment is being implemented at ICAR-RCER, Patna, Bihar, India, with four treatments: (a) TA, (b) full CA (fCA) and (c and d) partial CA (pCA1 and pCA2), differing in crop establishment methods, cropping system and crop residue management in a randomized complete block design. Measurement of soil health parameters was carried out in the 11th year of the experiment. The results revealed a beneficial effect of CA and 46 and 40% increase in SOC concentration and stock, respectively, under fCA over TA in the 0-7.5-cm soil layer. The effect of partial CA (pCA1 and pCA2) was variable, but an increasing trend was always observed under pCA compared to TA. There was an enrichment in SOC content of aggregates under CA irrespective of size class; however, no relation was found between SOC content and aggregate diameter. The contribution of macroaggregates to SOC stock was larger (36-66%) under CA in the 0-7.5-cm soil layer. Adoption of CA improved the macroaggregate content, MWD and GMD of aggregates, and aggregation ratio. Soil macropore content was greater under fCA, whereas other parameters were similar among treatments. The impact of CA was mostly limited to 0-7.5 cm soil layer and a maximum up to 15 cm soil depth while evaluation until 60 cm soil depth was realized. The yield of rice in CA was comparable to or higher than in TA, whereas the system rice equivalent yield was always higher (38-53%) under CA than under the conventional practices. Therefore, a CA-based cropping system must be encouraged, to increase SOC status, improve aggregation stability and, consequently, sustain or increase system productivity, in order to achieve food and nutritional security in the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain of India.
HIGHLIGHTS: Effects of long-term conservation agriculture (CA) on soil C, aggregation and yield were evaluated.CA improved SOC concentration and stock by 46 and 40%, as well as macroaggregate SOC stock by 36-66%.Macro-aggregation and mean weight diameter improved in CA but was mostly limited to a shallow soil depth.CA can be promoted for sustainability of a rice-wheat system due to higher productivity (38-53%).","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The experiment was undertaken at ICAR‐RCER, Patna, Bihar, India, with the collaboration of CIMMYT, Mexico.

6019,pub.1135329248,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145815,33631586,,Regional carbon stock assessment and the potential effects of land cover change,"Accurate assessment of carbon stocks remains a global challenge. High levels of uncertainty in Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry reporting has hindered decision-makers and investors worldwide to support sustainable soil and vegetation management. Potential mitigation-driven activities and effects are likely to be locally/regionally unique. A spatially-targeted approach is thus required to optimise strategic carbon management. This study provides a new regional carbon assessment (tier 3) approach using biophysical-process modelling of high-resolution Land Cover (LC) data within a UK National Park (NFNP) to provide higher accuracy. Future Land Cover Change (LCC) scenarios were simulated. Vegetation-driven carbon dynamics were modelled by coupling two widely-used models, LPJ-GUESS and RothC-26.3. Transition and persistence analysis was conducted using Terrset's Land Change Modeller to predict likely future LCC for 2040 using Multi-Layer Perceptron Markov-Chain Analysis. Current total carbon in the NFNP is 7.32-8.73 Mt C, with current trajectories of LCC leading to minor losses of up to 0.39 Mt C. Alternative LCC scenarios indicated possible gains or losses of 1.27 Mt C, or 136.7 t C ha-1. The importance of vegetation-driven carbon storage was greater than the national average, with a VegC pool 12-14% of the soil organic C pool, placing greater significance on local/regional LC and management policy. The potential storage capacity of each LC class was ranked (highest to lowest): Coniferous > Broadleaved/Mixed > Coastal > Semi-natural Grassland > Heath > Improved Grassland > Arable (Cropland). Opportunities were prioritised to inform landscape-scale management to reduce future carbon losses and/or to enhance gains through LCC. Balancing the carbon budget relies upon maintaining existing LC.

6018,pub.1124341634,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136414,32045769,,Differential responses of soil hydrolytic and oxidative enzyme activities to the natural forest conversion,"Effects of natural forest conversion (NFC) on soil nutrient turnover are substantially mediated by soil microbial extracellular hydrolytic enzymatic activities (Hy-EEAs) and oxidative enzymatic activities (Ox-EEAs). Yet it remains largely unknown the indicative links between soil Hy- and Ox-EEAs and soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supplies based on economic theories of microbial metabolism under NFC. Here we used a meta-analysis approach to synthesize the responses of the soil C-, N-, P-degrading Hy-EEAs and Ox-EEAs, soil microbial biomass, soil organic C, total N, P and available P parameters to natural forest conversion from 51 peer-reviewed studies. Our results showed that NFC notably decreased soil Hy-EEAs but statistically insignificant reduction of soil Ox-EEAs. The changes of soil Hy- and Ox-EEAs were significantly and positively associated with soil organic C, available P as well as microbial biomass C and N but significantly and negatively correlated with soil pH, whereas the changes of soil C/N impacted on soil Ox-EEAs remarkably but not for soil Hy-EEAs. The depletion of soil organic carbon stimulated soil microbial secretion of Hy- and Ox-EEAs. The soil total N scarcity only provoked soil microbial Hy-EEAs rather than Ox-EEAs. The soil total P dearth quickened the soil Ox-EEAs, however, the plenitude of soil available P suppressed soil Hy- and Ox-EEAs. Moreover, the eco-enzymatic stoichiometry of soil Hy-EEAs indicated that soil N and P nutrient limitation after NFC restricted soil microbial N- and P-acquiring enzymes secretion, which ultimately reduced resources availability for C acquisition. Altogether, the distinct responses of soil Hy- and Ox-EEAs depended on substrate availability peculiarly for soil N and P gains of microorganisms for further enzymatic ability on soil C decomposition and highlighted the abundant or absent supply of soil N and P for positive or negative enzymatic activities on metabolic requirement of soil edaphons.","The authors thank the three anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.

Among these mobil oil has major application in automobiles and different machines. The combustion of mobil oil renders a non-usable form that ultimately enters the environment thereby causing problems to environmental health. The aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon fraction of mobil oil has serious human and environmental health hazards. These components upon interaction with soil affect its fertility and microbial diversity. The recent advancement in the omics approach viz. metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics has led to increased efficiency for the use of microbial based remediation strategy. Additionally, the use of biosurfactants further aids in increasing the bioavailability and thus biodegradation of crude oil constituents. The combination of more than one approach could serve as an effective tool for efficient reduction of oil contamination from diverse ecosystems. To the best of our knowledge only a few publications on mobil oil have been published in the last decade. This systematic review could be extremely useful in designing a micro-bioremediation strategy for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems contaminated with mobil oil or petroleum hydrocarbons that is both efficient and feasible.

It is important to evaluate the long-term biochar CS potential by integrating the complex physical interferences and biochemical reactions in real soil. This study incorporated biochar into a biogeochemical field model and established a daily-resolution simulator to assess 5-, 50-, 500-year CS potential upon Soil-Biochar-Plant interaction. Through the scenario simulation of burying 7.5-75 t/ha BC-C in a 50 cm-depth rainfed cropland soil with corn planted, we found biochar could retain 483-557 kg C/t BC-C after 500 years' natural decomposition, although soil pedoturbation and plant erosion accelerated its mineralization. Moreover, biochar provided labile-C to compensate microbial decomposition and modified long-term soil climate, resulting in a decrease in soil organic carbon degradation of 44-265 kg C/t BC-C. Furthermore, biochar promoted plant photosynthetic performance by offering exogenous nutrients, equivalent to capturing 66-1039 kg C/t BC-C over 50 years. But biochar limited endogenous nutrient release and inhibited plant growth after exogenous nutrients exhausted, so total CS decreases yearly after reaching an upper limit (1030-1722 kg C/t BC-C). A total of 651-725 kg C/t BC-C could be sequestered after 500 years. And biochar is more potential in infertile and arid soils. Overall, this study indicates the necessity of taking the biogeochemical reactions into consideration to assess biochar long-term CS, and it further demonstrates biochar soil implementation is a prospective carbon-negative strategy.","This work is supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2020YFC1806700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41877110), and National Observation and Research Station of Erhai Lake Ecosystem in Yunnan.",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Charcoal; Prospective Studies; Soil,2022-01-30,2022,2022-01-30,2022-05,822,,153576,Closed,Article,"Yin, Jianxiang; Zhao, Ling; Xu, Xiaoyun; Li, Deping; Qiu, Hao; Cao, Xinde","Yin, Jianxiang (China-UK Low Carbon College, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 201306, China.); Zhao, Ling (China-UK Low Carbon College, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 201306, China; School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.

However, the impacts of SA technology on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and agronomic yield are usually evaluated separately and their results are inconsistent. To address this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis synthesizing 40 peer-reviewed studies on the effects of SA technology on GHG and ammonia (NH3) emissions, nitrogen uptake (NU), crop yield, and soil residual NO3-N in rice paddies and upland cropping system. Compared to the surface application of N, SA technology significantly increased rice yields by 32 % and crop yield in upland systems by 62 %. The largest SA-induced increases in crop yield were found at low N input rates (<100 kg Nha-1) in rice paddies and medium N input rates (100-200 kg Nha-1) in upland systems, suggesting that soil moisture is a key factor determining the efficiency of SA technology. SA treatments increased yields by more at reduced fertilizer rates (~30 % less N), a shallow depth (<10 cm), and with urea in both cropping systems than at the full (recommended) N rate, a deeper depth (10-20 cm), and with ammonical fertilizer. SA treatments significantly increased NU in rice paddies (34 %) and upland systems (18 %), and NO3-N (40 %) in paddyland; however, NO3-N decreased (28 %) in upland conditions. Ammonia mitigation was greater in paddyland than in upland conditions. SA technology decreased the carbon footprint (CF) in paddyland by 29 % and upland systems by 36 %, and overall by 33 %. Compared with broadcasting, SA significantly reduced CH4 emissions by 16 %, N2O emissions by 30 %, and global warming potential (GWP) by 10 % in paddy cultivation. Given SA increased grain yield and NU while reducing NH3, CF, and GWP, this practice provides dual benefits - mitigating climate change and ensuring food security.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Clarifying whether the effects of legumes on N cycling vary with contrasting ecosystem types and climatic regions is crucial for understanding and predicting ecosystem processes, but these effects are currently unknown. By conducting a global meta-analysis, we revealed that legumes increased the soil net N mineralization rate (Rmin ) by 67%, which was greater than the recently reported increase associated with N deposition (25%). This effect was similar for tropical (53%) and temperate regions (81%) but was significantly greater in grasslands (151%) and forests (74%) than in croplands (-3%) and was greater in in situ incubation (101%) or short-term experiments (112%) than in laboratory incubation (55%) or long-term experiments (37%). Legumes significantly influenced the dependence of Rmin on N fertilization and experimental factors. The Rmin was significantly increased by N fertilization in the nonlegume soils, but not in the legume soils. In addition, the effects of mean annual temperature, soil nutrients and experimental duration on Rmin were smaller in the legume soils than in the nonlegume soils. Collectively, our results highlighted the significant positive effects of legumes on soil N cycling, and indicated that the effects of legumes should be elucidated when addressing the response of soils to plants.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We gratefully acknowledge financial support by the National Key Research and Development Program (2022YFF1302804), Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA23070202 and XDB40020000), National Natural Science Foundation of China (42277349, 41977068 and 41977105), the Programs from Chinese Academy of Sciences (QYZDB‐SSW‐DQC039), the US National Science Foundation Long‐Term Ecological Research (LTER) grant (DEB‐1831944 and LTREB DEB‐1753859) and Biological Integration Institutes grant (NSF‐DBI‐2021898).

A better understanding of the effects of different vegetation restoration types on SOC dynamics and fractions is critical in devising better policy to protect or enhance SOC stocks to improve soil quality and ecosystem function. In the present study, total, labile, and non-labile organic carbon (TOC, LC, and NLC), and carbon management index (CMI) of Cryptomeria fortunei (CF), mixed C. fortunei and Betula luminifera (MF), Neosinocalamus affinis (NA), and Camellia sinensis (CS) were compared with those of Zea mays field (ZM) on purple soil slopes in the Rainy Zone of Western China in order to develop more effective ways to implement vegetation restoration in the future. Different vegetation restoration types (CF, MF, NA and CS) increased TOC stock by 47.79%-118.31% and NLC stock by 56.61%-129.52% in the 0-50 cm soil layer compared with that of ZM. The direction and magnitude of changes in LC stock and CMI, however, depended strongly on the vegetation restoration type. Compared with ZM, CF had the largest increase of LC stock and CMI, whereas NA had the largest decrease of LC stock and CMI in the 0-50 cm soil layer. The LC:TOC ratio in four reforested species all declined significantly compared with that of ZM (p < 0.01), indicating decreased SOC activity after afforestation. The vegetation type and soil depth together explained more than 90% of the changes of TOC and its fractions in the plantations on purple soil slopes. Our study demonstrates that transforming the ZM into the CS is optimal to achieve the sustainable development goal, whereas transforming the ZM into the NA reduces the SOC activity and availability.","Financial supports from the Neijiang Normal University Research Start-Up Funds (No. 18B10), The National College Students&#x27; Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program (X2020003), The National Natural Science Foundation of China (41977004; 41601221), The Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) Program (2019QZKK0306), the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (2019052), Bingwei Outstanding Young Talent Project from the Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research (2017RC203), the Scientific Research Programs from State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology (2022-KF-04) and from State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau (A314021402-1602, A314021402-2010) are gratefully acknowledged.",,Journal of Environmental Management,,,Soil; Ecosystem; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; China,2023-01-13,2023,2023-01-13,2023-04,331,,117296,Closed,Article,"Yang, Fan; Zhong, Yujian; Han, Guangzhong; Li, Xiuzhi; Luo, Li; Cai, Xiaomin; Long, Xinyu; Li, Tangli; Huang, Laiming","Yang, Fan (Laboratory of Simulation on Soil Process, College of Geography and Resources Science, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China.); Zhong, Yujian (Laboratory of Simulation on Soil Process, College of Geography and Resources Science, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China.); Han, Guangzhong (Laboratory of Simulation on Soil Process, College of Geography and Resources Science, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China.); Li, Xiuzhi (Laboratory of Simulation on Soil Process, College of Geography and Resources Science, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China.); Luo, Li (Laboratory of Simulation on Soil Process, College of Geography and Resources Science, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China.); Cai, Xiaomin (Laboratory of Simulation on Soil Process, College of Geography and Resources Science, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China.); Long, Xinyu (Laboratory of Simulation on Soil Process, College of Geography and Resources Science, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China.); Li, Tangli (Laboratory of Simulation on Soil Process, College of Geography and Resources Science, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China.); Huang, Laiming (Yellow River Delta Modern Agricultural Engineering Laboratory, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing 100049, China.

In this article, a systematic review was conducted through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standard to identify the current research on constructed wetlands’ nature values and services from 2011 to 2020 of two databases, namely Scopus and Web of Science. The criteria of assessment focus on holistic deliberation of subject matters, namely carbon sequestration and water security as regulating and provisioning services, as well as nature values of constructed wetlands, namely instrumental and intrinsic values. As a result, 38 articles were selected and comprehensively examined. As the lack of an interdisciplinary approach makes data and information integration difficult, this study derived an integrated classification of constructed wetlands’ services and mapped with its nature values, guided by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment framework. Besides, mechanisms and factors affecting carbon sequestration and water security were also discussed. The carbon–water nexus was then conceptualised as interlinkages between engineered and natural physicochemical processes at the interface between carbon and water cycles. To fill the gaps, based on the carbon–water nexus concept, a new framework was synthesised at the end of the deliberation for constructed wetlands in regulating local climate through carbon sequestration and ensuring water security through water treatment and purification as well as influencing socio-cultural values, which needs an integrated approach that is the novelty of this work. The framework integrates the dichotomy of the instrumental-intrinsic nature values of constructed wetlands to evaluate the importance and benefit of the carbon–water nexus. The framework that reveals the vitality of nature values provided by constructed wetlands can help improve the decision-making to prioritise ecosystem services and conservation efforts, particularly in the sustainable management of constructed wetlands.","The authors would like to acknowledge the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, for financial supports through the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2019/WAB05/UKM/02/2).",This work was supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2019/WAB05/UKM/02/2) provided by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia.,Environmental Geochemistry and Health,,,Humans; Wetlands; Ecosystem; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Water Supply; Conservation of Natural Resources,2022-06-28,2022,2022-06-28,2023-05,45,5,1201-1230,Closed,Article,"Jamion, Nurul’ Ain; Lee, Khai Ern; Mokhtar, Mazlin; Goh, Thian Lai; Simon, Norbert; Goh, Choo Ta; Bhat, Irshad Ul Haq","Jamion, Nurul’ Ain (Institute for Environment and Development (LESTARI), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi MARA, Cawangan Negeri Sembilan, Kuala Pilah Campus, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia); Lee, Khai Ern (Institute for Environment and Development (LESTARI), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia; Jeffrey Sachs Center on Sustainable Development, Sunway University, Selangor, Malaysia); Mokhtar, Mazlin (Institute for Environment and Development (LESTARI), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia; Jeffrey Sachs Center on Sustainable Development, Sunway University, Selangor, Malaysia); Goh, Thian Lai (Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia); Simon, Norbert (Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia); Goh, Choo Ta (Institute for Environment and Development (LESTARI), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia); Bhat, Irshad Ul Haq (University of Technology and Applied Sciences (Higher College of Technology), Muscat, Oman)","Lee, Khai Ern (National University of Malaysia; Sunway University)","Jamion, Nurul’ Ain (National University of Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi MARA); Lee, Khai Ern (National University of Malaysia; Sunway University); Mokhtar, Mazlin (National University of Malaysia; Sunway University); Goh, Thian Lai (National University of Malaysia); Simon, Norbert (National University of Malaysia); Goh, Choo Ta (National University of Malaysia); Bhat, Irshad Ul Haq ()",9,9,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149025673,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,15 Life on Land

Rhizosphere nutrient availability directly regulates plant growth and is influenced by many factors, including soil properties, plant characteristics and climate. A quantitatively comprehensive understanding of the role of these factors in modulating rhizosphere nutrient availability remains largely unknown. We reviewed 123 studies to assess nutrient availability in the rhizosphere compared to bulk soil depending on various factors. The increase in microbial nitrogen (N) content and N-cycling related enzyme activities in the rhizosphere led to a 10% increase in available N relative to bulk soil. The available phosphorus (P) in the rhizosphere decreased by 12% with a corresponding increase in phosphatase activities, indicating extreme demand and competition between plants and microorganisms for P. Greater organic carbon (C) content around taproots (+17%) confirmed their stronger ability to store more organic compounds than the fibrous roots. This corresponds to higher bacterial and fungal contents and slightly higher available nutrients in the rhizosphere of taproots. The maximal rhizosphere nutrient accumulation was common for low-fertile soils, which is confirmed by the negative correlation between most soil chemical properties and the effect sizes of available nutrients. Increases in rhizosphere bacterial and fungal population densities (205-254%) were much higher than microbial biomass increases (indicated as microbial C: +19%). Consequently, despite the higher microbial population densities in the rhizosphere, the biomass of individual microbial cells decreased, pointing on their younger age and faster turnover. This meta-analysis shows that, contrary to the common view, most nutrients are more available in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil because of higher microbial activities around roots.","The work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2020YFC1808300), the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC; grant Nos: 41807091), and the Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection (Nos: SKLGP2020K014).

Through a global review of research on liming of grasslands, the objective of this paper was to assess the impacts of liming on soil pH, grass biomass production and total net GHG exchange (nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and net carbon dioxide (CO2)). We collected 57 studies carried out at 88 sites and covering different countries and climatic zones. All of the studies examined showed that liming either reduced or had no effects on the emissions of two potent greenhouse gases (N2O and CH4). Though liming of grasslands can increase net CO2 emissions, the impact on total net GHG emission is minimal due to the higher global warming potential, over a 100-year period, of N2O and CH4 compared to that of CO2. Liming grassland delivers many potential advantages, which justify its wider adoption. It significantly ameliorates soil acidity, increases grass productivity, reduces fertiliser requirement and increases species richness. To realise the maximum benefit of liming grassland, we suggest that acidic soils should be moderately limed within the context of specific climates, soils and management.","This work contributes to the SUPER-G project (funded under EU Horizon 2020 programme).

However, this intensive farming with large nutrient inputs has caused cropland degradation, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) overloads and water pollution, which have been reversed to initiate the construction of free trade ports. Here, we systematically review the status, driving factors, and environmental impacts of cropland degradation and nutrient overload with quantified evaluations and compared with other global tropics. Over the last 30 years, the soil pH in Hainan decreased by 0.3 units, and the soil organic carbon (SOC) decreased by 20%. This soil degradation has consequently aggravated nutrient losses, caused low use efficiency, and has required farmers add additional large nutrient to maintain harvests. P overuse is more serious than N overuse in Hainan due to the misuse of high P content compound fertilizers. The current N and P usage densities were 4% and 66% higher than the national average per crop season, i.e., 301 kg N ha-1 and 98 kg P ha-1, respectively, and the application rates were even higher for vegetables, i.e., 43% and 115% higher than the national average for vegetables. Consequently, water quality degradation occurred. The nutrient contents of several estuaries have exceeded the Class III standards. Potential improvement strategies are proposed: (i) Organic materials must be recycled to curb the declines in SOC and pH, and more benefits would be obtained by together use of biochar. (ii) Nutrient quotas must be implemented to balance nutrient budgets and reduce excessive surpluses and losses. (iii) The service functions of ecological protection zones for water and soil conservation must be strengthened. These strategies also apply to other global tropics that face similar challenges of soil and ecological degradation.","This work was supported by the Major Science and Technology Program of Hainan Province (ZDKJ2021008), Hainan Pesticide and Fertilizer Reduction and Efficiency Enhancement Project (2021–237), Quota of Nitrogen Fertilizer for Green Rice Production in Hainan Province and Its Realization Approach (YSPTZX202019), Innovation Platform for Academicians of Hainan Province (SQ2020PTZ0004), Academician Innovation Center of Hainan Province (RZ2000008513ky), Hainan Key Research and Development Project (ZDYF2021XDNY184) and Hainan University Startup Fund (KYQD(ZR)-20098).",,Environmental Pollution,,,"Agriculture; Carbon; China; Crops, Agricultural; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Soil",2022-09-05,2022,2022-09-05,2022-11,313,,120100,Closed,Article,"Li, Tingyu; Hong, Xiuyang; Liu, Shuoran; Wu, Xiaoqiao; Fu, Shan; Liang, Ye; Li, Jinghua; Li, Ran; Zhang, Chong; Song, Xiaotong; Zhao, Hongwei; Wang, Dengfeng; Zhao, Fengliang; Ruan, Yunze; Ju, Xiaotang","Li, Tingyu (Sanya Nanfan Research Institute of Hainan University, Hainan University, Sanya, 572025, China; College of Tropical Crops, Hainan University, Haikou, 570228, China.); Hong, Xiuyang (Sanya Nanfan Research Institute of Hainan University, Hainan University, Sanya, 572025, China; College of Tropical Crops, Hainan University, Haikou, 570228, China.); Liu, Shuoran (Sanya Nanfan Research Institute of Hainan University, Hainan University, Sanya, 572025, China; College of Tropical Crops, Hainan University, Haikou, 570228, China.); Wu, Xiaoqiao (Sanya Nanfan Research Institute of Hainan University, Hainan University, Sanya, 572025, China; College of Tropical Crops, Hainan University, Haikou, 570228, China.); Fu, Shan (Sanya Nanfan Research Institute of Hainan University, Hainan University, Sanya, 572025, China; College of Tropical Crops, Hainan University, Haikou, 570228, China.); Liang, Ye (Sanya Nanfan Research Institute of Hainan University, Hainan University, Sanya, 572025, China; College of Tropical Crops, Hainan University, Haikou, 570228, China.); Li, Jinghua (Sanya Nanfan Research Institute of Hainan University, Hainan University, Sanya, 572025, China; College of Tropical Crops, Hainan University, Haikou, 570228, China.); Li, Ran (Sanya Nanfan Research Institute of Hainan University, Hainan University, Sanya, 572025, China; College of Tropical Crops, Hainan University, Haikou, 570228, China.); Zhang, Chong (Sanya Nanfan Research Institute of Hainan University, Hainan University, Sanya, 572025, China.); Song, Xiaotong (State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China.); Zhao, Hongwei (Key Laboratory of A&F Environmental Processes and Ecological Regulation of Hainan Province, College of Ecology and Environment, Hainan University, Haikou, 570228, China.); Wang, Dengfeng (Tropical Crops Genetic Resources Institute of Chinese Academy of Tropical Agriculture Sciences (CATAS), Haikou, 571101, Hainan, China.); Zhao, Fengliang (Environment and Plant Protection Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences (CATAS), Haikou 571101, Hainan, China.); Ruan, Yunze (Sanya Nanfan Research Institute of Hainan University, Hainan University, Sanya, 572025, China; College of Tropical Crops, Hainan University, Haikou, 570228, China.); Ju, Xiaotang (Sanya Nanfan Research Institute of Hainan University, Hainan University, Sanya, 572025, China; College of Tropical Crops, Hainan University, Haikou, 570228, China.

Nevertheless, unreasonable NF results in massive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, leading to climate change and global warming. Many studies have already reported the impact of NF on crop yield, global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), but the studies were limited to only some parameters. In this study, a total of 174 studies from 16 countries were collected and then a regression analysis was conducted to obtain the appropriate N fertilization rates that enhance crop yield while reducing GWP and GHGI. After that, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of NF on crop yield, GHGI, GWP and GHG emissions and identify NF management strategies that benefit crop yield and maintain GWP. The results showed that the suitable N fertilization rate was 180, 150, 130 and 200 kg ha-1 for wheat, maize, rice and vegetables or industrial crops, respectively. Overall, NF resulted in positive effect size in crop yield (0.56) and negative effect size in GHGI (-0.14) compared to NNF. GWP showed positive effect size (0.37) due to an increase in N2O emissions (0.91) relative to NNF, which is higher than the increase of CH4 emissions (0.01) and CO2 emissions (0.22).

However, despite extensive field grazing experiments, there is currently no consensus on how different grazing management approaches affect alpine grassland diversity, soil carbon (C), and nitrogen (N). Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 70 peer-reviewed publications to evaluate the general response of 11 variables related to alpine grassland ecosystems plant diversity and ecological functions to grazing. Overall, the results showed that grazing significantly increased the species richness, Shannon-Wiener index, and Pielou evenness index values by 9.89% (95% CI: 2.75-17.09%), 7.28% (95% CI: 1.68-13.62%), and 3.74% (95% CI: 1.40-6.52%), respectively. Aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) decreased, respectively, by 41.91% (95% CI: -50.91 to -32.88%) and 17.68% (95% CI: -26.94 to -8.52%). Soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (TN), soil C:N ratio, and soil moisture decreased by 13.06% (95% CI: -15.88 to -10.15%), 12.62% (95% CI: -13.35 to -8.61%), 3.27% (95% CI: -4.25 to -2.09%), and 20.75% (95% CI: -27.89 to -13.61%), respectively, whereas, soil bulk density and soil pH increased by 17.46% (95% CI: 11.88-24.53%) and 2.24% (95% CI: 1.01-3.64%), respectively. Specifically, moderate grazing, long-durations (>5 years), and winter grazing contributed to increases in the species richness, Shannon-Wiener index, and Pielou evenness index. However, AGB, BGB, SOC, TN, and soil C:N ratios showed a decrease with enhanced grazing intensity. The response ratio of SOC was positively associated with AGB and BGB but was negatively related to the Shannon-Wiener index and Pielou evenness index. Furthermore, the effects of grazing on plant diversity, AGB, BGB, SOC, and TN in alpine grassland varied with grazing duration, grazing season, livestock type, and grassland type. The findings suggest that grazing should synthesize other appropriate grazing patterns, such as seasonal and rotation grazing, and, furthermore, additional research on grazing management of alpine grassland on the QTP is needed in the future.",,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41471450), the Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System (CARS-34), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (lzujbky-2021-ct11), Qilian Mountain National Park Mountain Vertical Belt Monitoring Plot Construction Project “Investigation and Testing of Ecosystems of Typical Forests, Shrubs, Grasslands and Meadows in the Vertical Distribution Belt of Haibei Area of National Park” (QHXH-2021-017), and Muli Duowei Gongma Wetland Protection and Restoration Project (2021).",Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2021-12-13,2021,2021-12-13,,12,,765070,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Wenlong; Liu, Chenli; Wang, Wenying; Zhou, Huakun; Xue, Yating; Xu, Jing; Xue, Pengfei; Yan, Hepiao","Li, Wenlong (State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystems, Key Laboratory of Grassland Livestock Industry Innovation, College of Pastoral Agriculture Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China); Liu, Chenli (State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystems, Key Laboratory of Grassland Livestock Industry Innovation, College of Pastoral Agriculture Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China); Wang, Wenying (Department of Life Sciences, Qinghai Normal University, Xining, China); Zhou, Huakun (Key Laboratory of Cold Regions Restoration Ecology, Qinghai Province, Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xining, China); Xue, Yating (College of Resources and Environment, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, China); Xu, Jing (School of Agriculture and Forestry Economic and Management, Lanzhou University of Finance and Economics, Lanzhou, China); Xue, Pengfei (State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystems, Key Laboratory of Grassland Livestock Industry Innovation, College of Pastoral Agriculture Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China); Yan, Hepiao (State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystems, Key Laboratory of Grassland Livestock Industry Innovation, College of Pastoral Agriculture Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China)","Liu, Chenli (Lanzhou University); Wang, Wenying (Qinghai Normal University)","Li, Wenlong (Lanzhou University); Liu, Chenli (Lanzhou University); Wang, Wenying (Qinghai Normal University); Zhou, Huakun (Chinese Academy of Sciences); Xue, Yating (Chengdu University of Information Technology); Xu, Jing (Lanzhou University of Finance and Economics); Xue, Pengfei (Lanzhou University); Yan, Hepiao (Lanzhou University)",16,16,1.22,8.19,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.765070/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143835622,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3007 Forestry Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology",14 Life Below Water

However, several studies show inconsistencies in whether and how organic amendments affect the taxonomic composition of soil microbial communities compared to the application of sole chemical fertilizers. This first global meta-analysis demonstrated that organic amendments increased the bacterial diversity indices (Shannon and Chao1) but had no significant effect on fungal diversity indices. When considering both bulk and rhizosphere soils, only copiotrophic strategies such as Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Zygomycota phylum demonstrated a significant increase in response to organic amendments, mainly because the environment with a significant increase in nutrients content preferentially supports the growth of copiotrophic species after the use of organic amendments. Additionally, the factors influencing the response of different dominant microbial phyla to organic amendments varied. Besides soil pH, the effect of organic amendments on different microbial phyla was significantly influenced by soil texture, organic fertilizer type, crop type, and climate type, providing insights into the diverse responses of microbial communities to organic amendments under varying conditions. Organic amendments significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) content and enzyme activities related to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) decomposition but had no significant effect on enzymes related to carbon (C) decomposition. Notably, the effect of organic amendments on the relative abundance of three dominant phyla (Mortierellomycota, Nitrospirae, and Firmicutes) was related to the effect on SOC, where the increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly positively associated with the increase in SOC.

However, the potential for acidification to mitigate NH3 emission from storage and the impact of manure acidification (pH range 5-8) on composting have been poorly studied. The effects of manure acidification at storage on the subsequent composting process, nutrient balance, gaseous emissions and product quality were assessed through an analysis of literature data and an experiment under controlled conditions. Results of the data mining showed that mineral acids, acidic salts and organic acids significantly reduced NH3 emission, however, a weaker effect was observed for organic acids. A subsequent composting experiment showed that using manure acidified to pH5 or pH6 as feedstock delayed organic matter degradation for 7-10 days, although pH6 had no negative effect on compost maturity. Acidification significantly decreased NH3 emission from both storage and composting, however, excessive acidification (pH5) enhanced N2O emissions (18.6%) during composting. When manure was acidified to pH6, N2O (17.6%) and CH4 (20%) emissions, and total GHG emissions expressed as global warming potential (GWP) (9.6%) were reduced during composting. Acidification of manure before composting conserved more N as NH4+ and NOx- in compost product. Compared to the control, the labile, plant-available phosphorus (P) content in the compost product, predominately as water-soluble inorganic P, increased with manure acidification to pH5 and pH6. Acidification of manure to pH6 before composting decreases nutrient losses and gaseous emissions without decreasing the quality of the compost product. The techno-economic advantages of acidification should be further ascertained.",We thankfully acknowledge the financial support from the National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC0213300]; Science and Technology Program of Hebei [18226607D]; the Research Equipment Developing Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [YJKYYQ20170066]; Science and Technology Service Network Initiative [KFJ-STS-ZDTP-053]; Distinguished Young Scientists Project of Natural Science Foundation of Hebei [D2017503023]; Hebei Dairy Cattle Innovation Team of Modern Agroindustry Technology Research System [HBCT2018120206]; Hebei Poultry Innovation Team of Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System [HBCT2018150209]; National Science Foundation of China (41601511); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (D2017503022); the President&#x27;s International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI) of the Chinese Academy of Science [2016DE008 and 2016VBA073]; and the UK China Virtual Joint Centre for Improved Nitrogen Agronomy (CINAg) funded by the Newton Fund via UK BBSRC/NERC [BB/N013468/1].,,Journal of Environmental Management,,,Ammonia; Composting; Gases; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Manure; Methane; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Soil,2020-04-02,2020,2020-04-02,2020-06,264,,110454,Closed,Article,"Cao, Yubo; Wang, Xuan; Liu, Ling; Velthof, Gerard L.; Misselbrook, Tom; Bai, Zhaohai; Ma, Lin","Cao, Yubo (Key Laboratory of Agricultural Water Resources, Hebei Key Laboratory of Soil Ecology, Center for Agricultural Resources Research, Institute of Genetic and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Science, 286 Huaizhong Road, Shijiazhuang, 050021, Hebei, China; University of Chinese Academy of Science, 19 A Yuquan Road, Shijingshan District, Beijing, 100049, China); Wang, Xuan (Key Laboratory of Agricultural Water Resources, Hebei Key Laboratory of Soil Ecology, Center for Agricultural Resources Research, Institute of Genetic and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Science, 286 Huaizhong Road, Shijiazhuang, 050021, Hebei, China); Liu, Ling (Key Laboratory of Agricultural Water Resources, Hebei Key Laboratory of Soil Ecology, Center for Agricultural Resources Research, Institute of Genetic and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Science, 286 Huaizhong Road, Shijiazhuang, 050021, Hebei, China; University of Chinese Academy of Science, 19 A Yuquan Road, Shijingshan District, Beijing, 100049, China); Velthof, Gerard L.

However, these studies couldn't comprehensively quantify the mining-induced variations of soil PTE concentrations at the national scale. Moreover, the quantitative relationships between the effects of mining on soil PTEs and some related factors remained unclear at the national scale. This study first conducted a literature survey for soil PTE data affected by mining in China. Then, the random-effects model in the meta-analysis was used to quantify mining-induced variations of soil PTE concentrations in the surrounding areas. Last, the single meta-regression was used to explore the relationships between the effects of mining on soil PTEs and the related factors at the national scale. Results showed that: (i) mining-induced increases of soil PTE concentrations followed the order: Cd (1017%) > Hg (319%) > Pb (291%) > Zn (176%) > Cu (129%) > As (92%) > Ni (23%); (ii) mining-induced increases of soil PTE concentrations in clay (531%), non-ferrous mine (188%), paddy field (212%), and Central South China (290%) were more than those in other soil textures, mine types, land-use types, and geographical divisions, respectively; (iii) the effects of mining on soil PTEs were negatively correlated with soil pH (QM = 29.76, p < 0.01) and positively correlated with soil organic carbon (QM = 28.54, p < 0.01) and mean annual precipitation (QM = 91.75, p < 0.01); (iv) the effects of mining overall decreased with the sampling year (QM = 35.01, p < 0.01) and showed latitudinal zonality (QM = 180.39, p < 0.01). The above results provided valuable information for soil PTE mitigation in the areas affected by mining in China.","This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1800104], the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771249], and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS [2018348].",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,"Carbon; China; Environmental Monitoring; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment; Soil; Soil Pollutants",2022-01-29,2022,2022-01-29,2022-05,821,,153562,Closed,Article,"Guang, Xu; Chen, Jian; Qu, Mingkai; Zhang, Jianlin; Liu, Hongbo; Zhao, Yongcun; Huang, Biao","Guang, Xu (Key Laboratory of Soil Environment and Pollution Remediation, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, East Beijing Road 71, Nanjing 210008, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yuquan Road 19, Beijing 100049, China.); Chen, Jian (Key Laboratory of Soil Environment and Pollution Remediation, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, East Beijing Road 71, Nanjing 210008, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yuquan Road 19, Beijing 100049, China.); Qu, Mingkai (Key Laboratory of Soil Environment and Pollution Remediation, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, East Beijing Road 71, Nanjing 210008, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yuquan Road 19, Beijing 100049, China.

Over the past half century, however, grasslands have faced numerous threats, including the abandonment of traditional agro-pastoral practices. Our hypothesis was that mowing and prescribed burning are management practices potentially effective in counteracting the reduction of plant diversity triggered by land abandonment. However, the long-term effects of such management practices on plant communities and soil microbiota in Mediterranean grassland remain poorly studied. Here, we conducted a 5-year field experiment comparing prescribed fire, vegetation mowing, and abandonment in a fire-prone Mediterranean grassland in southern Italy in order to evaluate the capability of such management strategies to counteract the detrimental impacts of land abandonment on plant diversity and the associated increase of wildfire. We combined vegetation analysis and soil chemical characterization and several microbiota analyses, including microbial biomass and respiration, arthropod community, and high-throughput sequencing of bacterial and eukaryotic rRNA gene markers. Burning and mowing significantly increased plant species richness and diversity compared to abandonment plots, reducing the abundance of perennial tall grasses in favour of short-lived species. Standing litter followed the same trend, being 3.8-fold greater and largely composed of grass remains in the abandoned compared to burnt and mowed plots. In the soil, prescribed burning caused significant increase in pH, a reduction in organic carbon, total N, and cation exchange capacity. Diversity and taxonomic composition of bacterial and fungal microbiota was affected by burning and mowing treatments. Abandonment caused shifts of microbiota towards a fungal-dominated system, composed of late successional fungi of the Basidiomycota. Fast-growing and putative fungal pathogens were more abundant under burnt and mowed treatments. Soil arthropods were influenced by vegetation and microbiota changes, being strongly reduced in mowed plots. Our study demonstrated that grassland abandonment promotes the spread of tall grasses, reducing plant diversity and increasing the risk of wildfire, while prescribed burning and mowing are effective in counteracting such negative effects.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",The Science of The Total Environment,,,Animals; Arthropods; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Grassland; Microbiota; Plants; Poaceae; Soil,2022-04-22,2022,2022-04-22,2022-08,834,,155442,Closed,Article,"Bonanomi, Giuliano; Idbella, Mohamed; Abd-ElGawad, Ahmed M; Motti, Riccardo; Ippolito, Francesca; Santorufo, Lucia; Adamo, Paola; Agrelli, Diana; De Marco, Anna; Maisto, Giulia; Zotti, Maurizio","Bonanomi, Giuliano (Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Via Università 100, 80055 Portici, Italy; Task Force on Microbiome Studies, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy; Cicerale Research Center, Cicerale 84053, Campania region, Italy.); Idbella, Mohamed (Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Via Università 100, 80055 Portici, Italy; Laboratory of Biosciences, Faculty of Sciences and Techniques, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco; Cicerale Research Center, Cicerale 84053, Campania region, Italy.

5990,pub.1152149118,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159694,36302424,,Elevation dependent response of soil organic carbon stocks to forest windthrow,"Storms represent a major disturbance factor in forest ecosystems, but the effects of windthrows on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are poorly quantified. Here, we assessed the SOC stocks of windthrown forests at 19 sites across Switzerland spanning an elevation gradient from 420 to 1550 m, encompassing a strong climatic gradient. Results show that the effect size of disturbance on SOC stocks increases with the size of the initial SOC stocks. The largest windthrow-induced SOC losses of up to 29 t C ha-1 occurred in high-elevation forests with a harsh climate developing thick organic layers. In contrast, SOC stocks of low-elevation forests with thin organic layers were hardly affected. A mineralization study further revealed high elevation forests to store higher amounts of easily mineralizable C in thick organic layers that got lost following windthrow. These findings are supported by a meta-analysis of available windthrow studies, showing an increase of storm-induced SOC losses with the size of the initial SOC stocks. Modelling simulations further indicate longer-lasting SOC losses and a slower recovery of SOC stocks after windthrow at high compared to low elevations, due to a slower regeneration of mountain forests and associated lower C inputs into soils in a harsh climate. Upscaling the experimental findings/observed patterns by linking them to a data base of Swiss forest soils shows a total SOC loss of ∼0.4 Mt. C for the whole forested area of Switzerland after two major storm events, counteracting the forest net carbon sink of decades. Our study provides strong evidence that the vulnerability of SOC stocks to windthrow is particularly high in forests featuring thick and slowly forming organic layers, such as mountain soils. Thus, the risk of losing SOC to more frequent windthrows in mountain forests strongly limits their potential to mitigate climate change.",This research was funded by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN).

However, the effects of biochar interacted with nitrogen (N) on the mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial community have not been thoroughly understood, particularly no reports have been published on the long term effects of biochar in vegetable field. Here, we examined soil properties, SOC mineralization and microbial community affecting by biochar (0, 20 and 40 t ha-1; C0, C1 and C2, respectively), N (0 or 240 t ha-1; N0 or N1, respectively) and their interaction in a greenhouse vegetable field. Results indicated that biochar addition increased soil pH, SOC, recalcitrant C pool, especially for the 40 t ha-1 treatment. Biochar addition generally decreased soil C-cycling enzyme activity while increasing N and P-cycling enzyme and oxidase activities. Biochar combined with N addition reduced SOC mineralization rate and metabolic quotient (qCO2) by 10.2-22.0% and 6.85-30.4%, respectively, across 15-35 °C and the temperature sensitivity (Q10) by 0.96-4.70%, except for the N1C2 at 25-35 °C. Apparent changes in bacterial alpha diversity and community structures were observed among treatments. Besides, biochar mixed with N application significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased Acidobacteria, while did not result in significant differences in fungal diversity and community composition. Redundancy analysis indicated that the microbial community composition shifts induced by the interaction between N and biochar were attributed to the changes in soil chemical properties, such as pH and SOC. Overall, the combination of biochar and N fertilizer is recommended to improve SOC sequestration potential and regulate bacterial community diversity and composition in vegetable field for sustainable intensification.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The study covered 24 research sites in afforested areas-juvenile forest stands dominated by Scots pine, Norway spruce and Silver birch. The initial measurements were conducted in 2012 and repeated in 2021. The results show that afforestation mostly leads to a general decrease in soil BD and SOC stock in 0-40 cm soil layer and an increase in C stock in tree biomass across afforested areas with various tree species, soil types, and former land uses. The physical and chemical properties of the soil could explain the differences in changes in soil BD and SOC caused by afforestation, as well as the impact of past land use may have persisted.

To date, most research on soil carbon (C) sequestration has focused on croplands where the levels of native soil organic matter (SOM) are typically low and significant potential exists to replenish SOM stocks. However, with the renewed push to achieve “net zero” C emissions by 2050, grasslands may offer an additional C store, utilising tools such as biochar. Here, we critically evaluate the potential for biochar as a technology for increasing grassland C stocks, identifying a number of practical, economic, social and legislative challenges that need to be addressed before the widescale adoption of biochar may be achieved. We critically assess the current knowledge within the field of grassland biochar research in the context of ecosystem service provision and provide opinions on the applicability of biochar as an amendment to different types of grassland (improved, semi-improved and unimproved) and the potential effect on ecosystem provision using a range of application techniques in the topsoil and subsoil. We concluded that the key question remains, is it possible for managed grasslands to store more C, without causing a loss in additional ecosystem services? To address this question future research must take a more multidisciplinary and holistic approach when evaluating the potential role of biochar at sequestering C in grasslands to mitigate climate change.Graphical Abstract",We thank the editors and reviewers for their constructive comments.,This work was supported by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) through the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) funded Greenhouse Gas Removal Biochar Demonstrator project (BB/V011596/1).,Biochar,,,,2023-06-12,2023,2023-06-12,2023,5,1,33,All OA; Gold,Article,"Brown, Robert W.; Chadwick, David R.; Bott, Tom; West, Helen M.; Wilson, Paul; Hodgins, Genevieve R.; Snape, Colin E.; Jones, Davey L.","Brown, Robert W.

The use of biochar as an amendment represents a tool to store organic carbon (C) in soil. The vulnerability of soil organic C (SOC) to the joint effects of climate change and biochar application needs to be better understood by investigating its main pools. Here, we evaluated the effects of partial rain exclusion (∼30%) and temperature increase (∼2 °C), combined with biochar amendment, on the distribution of soil organic matter (SOM) into particulate organic matter (POM) and the mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM). A set of indices suggested an increase in thermal stability in response to biochar addition in both POM and MAOM fractions. The MAOM fraction, compared to the POM, was particularly enriched in labile substances. Data from micro-Raman spectroscopy suggested that the POM fraction contained biochar particles with a more ordered structure, whereas the structural order decreased in the MAOM fraction, especially after climate manipulation. Crystalline Fe oxides (hematite) and a mix of ferrihydrite and hematite were detected in the POM and in the MAOM fraction, respectively, of the unamended plots under climate manipulation, but not under ambient conditions. Conversely, in the amended soil, climate manipulation did not induce changes in Fe speciation. Our work underlines the importance of discretely taking into account responses of both MAOM and POM to better understand the mechanistic drivers of SOC storage and dynamics.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Due to the limitation of knowledge and analytical techniques, it is currently challenging to discern the contribution of biotic and abiotic processes to the terrestrial N cycle for geobiologists and biogeochemists alike. To better understand the role of abiotic reactions in the terrestrial N cycle, it is necessary to comprehend the chemical controls on nitrogenous trace gas emissions and N retention in soil under various environmental conditions. In this manuscript, we assess the role of abiotic reactions in nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions as well as N retention through a meta-analysis using all related peer-reviewed publications before August 2020. Results show that abiotic reactions contributed 29.3-37.7% and 44.0-57.0% to the total N2O emission and N retention, representing 3.7-4.7 and 4.0-6.0 Tg year-1 of global terrestrial N2O emission and N retention, respectively. Much higher NO production was observed in sterilized soils than that in unsterilized treatments indicating the major contribution of chemical reactions to NO emission and rapid microbial reduction of NO to N2O and N2. Chemical hydroxylamine oxidation accounts for the largest abiotic contribution to N2O emission, while chemical nitrite reduction and fixation represent for the largest contribution to abiotic NO production and soil N retention, respectively. Factors influencing the abiotic processes include pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N), and transition metals. These results broadened our knowledge about the mechanisms involved in chemical N reactions and provided a simplified estimation about their contribution to nitrogenous trace gas emission and N retention, which is meaningful to further study interactions of biologically and chemically mediated reactions in biogeochemical N cycle.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Forests are crucial in maintaining biodiversity and mitigating climate change. Apart from continuing deforestation, forests also face increasing pressure from livestock grazing in the system, which is less understood compared to grasslands. Through a meta-analysis of 156 articles with 1936 data entries, this study assesses the effect of livestock on forest biodiversity, structure, and functions, varying with livestock types, livestock density, grazing history, and climatic factors. Our results show that livestock overall had a negative impact on the forest structure and functions, reduced species abundance but increased richness. Medium and large mammals, plant communities, and soil were more negatively affected compared to other groups such as birds and invertebrates. Livestock also influenced the role of forests in mitigating climate change. They changed forest carbon stock by reducing plant biomass; however, they did not significantly impact the soil carbon stock or soil greenhouse gas emissions. Ecosystem attributes were more affected in warmer and drier regions and by single species grazing than the mixed grazing. Past livestock grazing history moderates the impacts of livestock, with the strongest negative effect occurred with a history of 1-5 years. Nonetheless, livestock activities also had a positive impact on forest management, such as reducing forest flammability. Our results also indicate the lack of studies on how higher trophic levels respond to livestock disturbances and how grazing intensity moderates the effect, which includes grazing duration and livestock density. The complex responses of forests to livestock in different conditions call for more adaptive management depending on the conservation targets and evolution history.",We would like to thank the funding support from Ocean Park Conservation Foundation Hong Kong (TM03_1819).,,Global Change Biology,,,Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Livestock; Soil,2021-07-28,2021,2021-07-28,2021-10,27,19,4745-4757,Closed,Article,"Li, Binbin V.; Jiang, Bingkun","Li, Binbin V.

In addition, anthropogenic activity has altered the global carbon (C) cycle and triggered climate change. Soil is the largest pool of organic C in terrestrial ecosystems, but its ability to retain and store C varies. As humans move forward to mitigate climate change, there is a growing need to understand the C storing capacity of soils and their interactions with factors like climate, vegetation or a footprint of human activity. Here, we constructed a meta-analysis which focused on 30 cm soil depth by collecting data from over 191 studies measuring soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks across natural, urban green space, and urban intensive habitats. We then compared the SOC data between different climatic zones, vegetation types, and anthropogenic influences with the human footprint index. The results indicate that SOC stocks in natural habitats (98.22 ± 49.10 Mg ha-1) are significantly higher than those of urban green spaces (54.61 ± 22.02 Mg ha-1) and urban intensive habitats (65.88 ± 35.27 Mg ha-1). We find a significant and negative relationship between the human footprint and SOC stocks of natural habitats but not between the human footprint and either of the urban habitats. Urban intensive and urban green space habitat soils store less C than natural ones. However, when compared across climatic zones or vegetation types, the capacity of natural soils to store C is variable and vulnerable to human activity. Carbon storage in urban soils is likely limited by persistent and stable anthropogenic influences keeping variability low. This is most pronounced in urban green spaces where human management is high (i.e. a golf course) and SOC is low. A comprehensive understanding of C storage in soils is essential to land management and climate mitigation measures.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Tackling this question is crucial to better understanding terrestrial responses to climate change as fine-root traits drive many ecosystem processes. We carried out a detailed synthesis of fine-root trait responses to experimental warming by performing a meta-analysis of 964 paired observations from 177 publications. Warming increased fine-root biomass, production, respiration and nitrogen concentration as well as decreased root carbon : nitrogen ratio and nonstructural carbohydrates. Warming effects on fine-root biomass decreased with greater warming magnitude, especially in short-term experiments. Furthermore, the positive effect of warming on fine-root biomass was strongest in deeper soil horizons and in colder and drier regions. Total fine-root length, morphology, mortality, life span and turnover were unresponsive to warming. Our results highlight the significant changes in fine-root traits in response to warming as well as the importance of warming magnitude and duration in understanding fine-root responses. These changes have strong implications for global soil carbon stocks in a warmer world associated with increased root-derived carbon inputs into deeper soil horizons and increases in fine-root respiration.","We express our sincere appreciation to all scientists whose valuable work was used in this study.

Forty-nine antibiotics were reported, in which chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were the most prevalent and had relatively high concentrations. The responses of ARG and mobile genetic element (MGE) abundances to farmland application of antibiotic-contaminated manures varied considerably under different management strategies and environmental settings. On average, compared to unamended treatments, farmland application of antibiotic-contaminated manures significantly increased the total ARG and MGE abundances by 591% and 351%, respectively (P < 0.05). Of all the included ARG classes, the largest increase was found for sulfonamide resistance genes (1121%), followed by aminoglycoside (852%) and tetracycline (763%) resistance genes. Correlation analysis suggested that soil organic carbon (SOC) was significantly negatively correlated with antibiotic concentrations in manured soil (P < 0.05) due to the formation of covalent bonds and nonextractable residues. Soil silt content was significantly positively correlated with antibiotic concentration (P < 0.05), which was attributed to greater sorption capacities.

However, the high variation in research results requires an accurate evaluation of the ERS effects. In this study, three typical ERS modes, rice-crayfish, rice-duck, and rice-fish were selected, and a meta-analysis was conducted using the data of 34 studies to comprehensively evaluate the effects of ERSs on GHG emissions, the global warming potential (GWP), and GHG intensity (GHGI). The results showed that the ERSs reduced CH4 emissions significantly (-12.5%), but increased N2O emissions by 11.3% as compared with traditional rice-cropping systems (TRSs). Further, ERSs have slightly lower GWP, rice yield, and GHGI values (6.5%, 5.5%, and 5.6%, respectively) than TRSs. The rice-crayfish and rice-duck modes significantly alleviated the GWP by 18.0% and 11.1%, respectively, whereas the rice-fish mode enhanced the GWP by 20.8%. Moreover, the rice-duck mode significantly reduced the GHGI by 17.2%, while the ricecrayfish and rice-fish modes increased the GHGI by 9.7% and 8.8%, respectively. Further, the ERSs significantly changed the dissolved oxygen concentration in the flood water as well as the Eh, dissolved organic carbon, and ammonium nitrogen in the soil, wherein the effect sizes of the ERSs on the GHG emissions were significantly correlated with their respective increase. Considering the net ecosystem economic budget and CO2 emissions equivalent/output, ERSs were found to be effective ""green technologies"". Further, we found that the rice-duck ERS was a good ecological ricecropping system for global warming mitigation.

The influencing mechanism of biochar on soil properties is a key aspect of quantifying and predicting its benefits and trade-offs. The contribution of biochar to both environmental and agricultural benefits has been deeply discussed and extensively reviewed, but few reviews have focused on modeling biochar effects. An overview of recent advances in biochar modeling is illustrated and approaches classified in this paper. Applications of a machine learning model, a deterministic model, and a numerical model to biochar are categorized and summarized. A discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each model and a comparison among them are also provided. Finally, this paper gives many suggestions on narrowing the knowledge gap to advance biochar modeling. Further study of biochar modeling in management planning and design and application of the model results in agricultural systems will help accelerate the expansion of biochar's application scale and encourage the efficient utilization of waste in agricultural systems.","The authors appreciate the financial support by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41807196), Heilongjiang Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. LBH-Z19002), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2018M641793, 2021T140104), Heilongjiang Province Natural Science Foundation (YQ2021D003, QC2018019), University Nursing Program for Young Scholar with Creative Talents in Heilongjiang Province (UNPYSCT-2017018), Chinese Academy of Sciences (Z019005).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Agriculture; Charcoal; Soil; Soil Pollutants,2021-08-23,2021,2021-08-23,2022-01,802,,149861,Closed,Article,"Zhao, Ying; Li, YueLei; Yang, Fan","Zhao, Ying (School of Water Conservancy & Civil Engineering, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China; Joint Laboratory of Northeast Agricultural University and Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces (NEAU-MPICI), Harbin 150030, China.); Li, YueLei (School of Water Conservancy & Civil Engineering, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China; Joint Laboratory of Northeast Agricultural University and Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces (NEAU-MPICI), Harbin 150030, China.); Yang, Fan (School of Water Conservancy & Civil Engineering, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China; Joint Laboratory of Northeast Agricultural University and Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces (NEAU-MPICI), Harbin 150030, China.

While grasslands are widely subject to livestock grazing, the influence of grazing on grassland ecosystem C remains unclear. We studied the effect of long-term livestock grazing on C densities of different ecosystem components in 110 northern temperate grasslands across a broad agroclimatic gradient in Alberta, Canada. These grasslands stored 50 to 180 t ha-1C in live and dead vegetation, as well as soil C to 30 cm depth, with the majority as soil organic C (SOC). The mulch layer comprised a large amount of C (~18 t ha-1C) especially within humid grasslands. Although grazing reduced C densities in litter mass, total ecosystem C was 8.5 % greater under grazing (127.8 t ha-1) compared to those non-grazed (117.8 t ha-1), primarily due to increases in SOC and roots. Increases in SOC were consistently observed in the 0-15 cm layer across all climatic conditions, with changes in SOC of the 15-30 cm layer inversely related to aridity. A structural equation model revealed that increased SOC under grazing was indirectly attributed to increases in eudicot rather than graminoid biomass. In addition, SOC increased with graminoid quality (i.e., a reduced carbon to nitrogen ratio), which together with elevated eudicots, increased litter and mulch C, and ultimately enhanced SOC densities. When applied to spatial maps of habitat type and land use (livestock grazing) activity across the region, an area of ~3.8 M ha of grassland was projected to contain an additional 17.1 M t of C under grazing, primarily in mesic grasslands, worth an estimated $3.1 B (Cdn.) under current C valuation guidelines in Canada. Overall, these results highlight the importance of grasslands for C storage and establishing policies that maintain and promote their sustainable use, including light to moderate grazing.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

As crop and plant growth are significantly hampered under acidic soil conditions, many farmers, but increasingly as well forest managers, apply lime to raise the soil pH. Besides its direct effect on soil pH, liming also affects soil C and nutrient cycles and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed 1570 observations reported in 121 field-based studies worldwide, to assess liming effects on soil GHG fluxes and plant productivity. We found that liming significantly increases crop yield by 36.3%. Also, soil organic C (SOC) stocks were found to increase by 4.51% annually, though soil respiration is stimulated too (7.57%). Moreover, liming was found to reduce soil N2 O emission by 21.3%, yield-scaled N2 O emission by 21.5%, and CH4 emission and yield-scaled CH4 emission from rice paddies by 19.0% and 12.4%, respectively. Assuming that all acid agricultural soils are limed periodically, liming results in a total GHG balance benefit of 633-749 Tg CO2 -eq year-1 due to reductions in soil N2 O emissions (0.60-0.67 Tg N2 O-N year-1 ) and paddy soil CH4 emissions (1.75-2.21 Tg CH4  year-1 ) and increases in SOC stocks (65.7-110 Tg C year-1 ). However, this comes at the cost of an additional CO2 release (c. 624-656 Tg CO2  year-1 ) deriving from lime mining, transport and application, and lime dissolution, so that the overall GHG balance is likely neutral. Nevertheless, liming of acid agricultural soils will increase yields by at least 6.64 × 108  Mg year-1 , covering the food supply of 876 million people. Overall, our study shows for the first time that a general strategy of liming of acid agricultural soils is likely to result in an increasing sustainability of global agricultural production, indicating the potential benefit of liming acid soils for climate change mitigation and food security.","The authors sincerely acknowledge the scientists for their various contributions to the dataset used in this meta‐analysis.

5962,pub.1152707745,10.1111/gcb.16523,36371668,,Apparent thermal acclimation of soil heterotrophic respiration mainly mediated by substrate availability,"Multiple lines of existing evidence suggest that increasing CO2 emission from soils in response to rising temperature could accelerate global warming. However, in experimental studies, the initial positive response of soil heterotrophic respiration (RH ) to warming often weakens over time (referred to apparent thermal acclimation). If the decreased RH is driven by thermal adaptation of soil microbial community, the potential for soil carbon (C) losses would be reduced substantially. In the meanwhile, the response could equally be caused by substrate depletion, and would then reflect the gradual loss of soil C. To address uncertainties regarding the causes of apparent thermal acclimation, we carried out sterilization and inoculation experiments using the soil samples from an alpine meadow with 6 years of warming and nitrogen (N) addition. We demonstrate that substrate depletion, rather than microbial adaptation, determined the response of RH to long-term warming. Furthermore, N addition appeared to alleviate the apparent acclimation of RH to warming. Our study provides strong empirical support for substrate availability being the cause of the apparent acclimation of soil microbial respiration to temperature. Thus, these mechanistic insights could facilitate efforts of biogeochemical modeling to accurately project soil C stocks in the future climate.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank three anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions.

Plant diversity continues to decline globally; however, its influence on terrestrial C:N:P ratios remains uncertain. By conducting a global meta-analysis of 2049 paired observations in plant species mixtures and monocultures from 169 sites, we show that, on average across all observations, the C:N:P ratios of plants, soils, soil microbial biomass and enzymes did not respond to species mixture nor to the species richness in mixtures. However, the mixture effect on soil microbial biomass C:N changed from positive to negative, and those on soil enzyme C:N and C:P shifted from negative to positive with increasing functional diversity in mixtures. Importantly, species mixture increased the C:N, C:P, N:P ratios of plants and soils when background soil C:N, C:P, and N:P were low, but decreased them when the respective background ratios were high. Our results demonstrate that plant mixtures can balance terrestrial plant and soil C:N:P ratios dependent on background soil C:N:P. Our findings highlight that plant diversity conservation does not only increase plant productivity, but also optimizes ecosystem stoichiometry for the diversity and productivity of today’s and future vegetation.",We thank the authors whose work is included in this meta-analysis and editorial comments from Eric Searle.

We conducted a global meta-analysis of sediment equilibrium phosphate concentrations at net zero sorption (EPC0 ), which is the dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentration toward which sediments buffer solution DRP. Our analysis of 45 studies and >900 paired observations of DRP and EPC0 showed that sediments often have potential to remove or release P to the streamwater (83% of observations), meaning that ""equilibrium"" between sediment and streamwater is rare. This potential for P exchange is moderated by sediment and stream characteristics, including sorption affinity, stream pH, exchangeable P concentration, and particle sizes. The potential for sediments to modify streamwater DRP concentrations is often not realized owing to other factors (e.g., hydrologic interactions). Sediment surface chemistry, hyporheic exchange, and biota can also influence the potential exchange of P between sediments and the streamwater. Methodological choices significantly influenced EPC0 determination and thus the estimated potential for P exchange; we therefore discuss how to measure and report EPC0 to best suit research objectives and aid in interstudy comparison. Our results enhance understanding of the sediment P buffer and inform how EPC0 can be effectively applied to improve management of aquatic P pollution and eutrophication.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank all authors whose studies we synthesized; their research made this review possible.

We assessed the outcomes of smallholder agricultural systems and practices in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) against 35 mitigation, adaptation, and yield indicators by reviewing 50 articles with 77 cases of agroecological treatments relative to a baseline of conventional practices. Crop yields were higher for 63% of cases reporting yields. Crop diversity, income diversity, net income, reduced income variability, nutrient regulation, and reduced pest infestation, indicators of adaptative capacity, were associated with 70% or more of cases. Limited information on climate change mitigation, such as greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration impacts, was available. Overall, the evidence indicates that use of organic nutrient sources, diversifying systems with legumes and integrated pest management lead to climate change adaptation in multiple contexts. Landscape mosaics, biological control (e.g., enhancement of beneficial organisms) and field sanitation measures do not yet have sufficient evidence based on this review. Widespread adoption of agroecological practices and system transformations shows promise to contribute to climate change services and food security in LMICs. Gaps in adaptation and mitigation strategies and areas for policy and research interventions are finally discussed.","This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from the CGIAR Trust Fund and through bilateral funding agreements.

Yet, they can disrupt ecosystem processes in their new ranges, causing changes in the provision of other services. Here we review the effects of five widespread tree taxa (Acacia, Ailanthus, Eucalyptus, Pinus and Robinia) on six regulating ecosystem services in areas where they are non-native. We conducted a literature search for pair-wise comparisons between sites dominated by any of the selected taxa and sites with native vegetation. An array of variables were used as indicators for each ecosystem service. Data were analysed using multi-level meta-analyses to compare effects of taxa on each ecosystem service, and effects of the same taxa across contexts. We compiled 857 case studies from 107 source papers. Several taxa tended to increase climate regulation, mostly Eucalyptus. Acacia decreased fire risk prevention. Robinia, Acacia and Ailanthus increased soil fertility, while Eucalyptus and Pinus, tended to decrease it. Soil formation was enhanced by Robinia and Ailanthus. Acacia promoted the increase of water in land pools, while Eucalyptus tended to decrease them. All effects show a large heterogeneity across case studies. Part of this heterogeneity could be attributed to gross climatic differences (i.e. biome), to species differences within each genus, to the structure of the recipient ecosystem, and/or to human management. Managers and policy-makers should consider the context-dependency and the potential effects of non-native trees on a wide range of services to ground their decisions. Our analyses also revealed important gaps of knowledge (e.g. on fire risk prevention, erosion control or water cycle regulation) and some potential publication bias. The methodology used here easily allows for future updates as new information will become available.","Declaration of competing interest The author declares no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Although warming can affect both C input to and output from soil, direct and convincing evidence illustrating that warming induces a net change in soil C is still lacking. We synthesized the results from field warming experiments at 165 sites across the globe and found that climate warming had no significant effect on soil C stock. On average, warming significantly increased root biomass and soil respiration, but warming effects on root biomass and soil respiration strongly depended on soil nitrogen (N) availability. Under high N availability (soil C:N ratio < 15), warming had no significant effect on root biomass, but promoted the coupling between effect sizes of root biomass and soil C stock. Under relative N limitation (soil C:N ratio > 15), warming significantly enhanced root biomass. However, the enhancement of root biomass did not induce a corresponding C accumulation in soil, possibly because warming promoted microbial CO2 release that offset the increased root C input. Also, reactive N input alleviated warming-induced C loss from soil, but elevated atmospheric CO2 or precipitation increase/reduction did not. Together, our findings indicate that the relative availability of soil C to N (i.e., soil C:N ratio) critically mediates warming effects on soil C dynamics, suggesting that its incorporation into C-climate models may improve the prediction of soil C cycling under future global warming scenarios.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32171646, 32171553, 32001140).

Soils in vast areas of Amazonia are P-impoverished, and little is known about the variation or plasticity in plant P-use and -acquisition strategies across space and time, hampering the accuracy of projections in vegetation models. Here, we synthesize current knowledge of leaf P resorption, fine-root P foraging, arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses, and root acid phosphatase and organic acid exudation and discuss how these strategies vary with soil P concentrations and in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 . We identify knowledge gaps and suggest ways forward to fill those gaps. Additionally, we propose a conceptual framework for the variations in plant P-use and -acquisition strategies along soil P gradients of Amazonia. We suggest that in soils with intermediate to high P concentrations, at the plant community level, investments are primarily directed to P foraging strategies via roots and arbuscular mycorrhizas, whereas in soils with intermediate to low P concentrations, investments shift to prioritize leaf P resorption and mining strategies via phosphatases and organic acids.","This research was supported by the International Graduate School of Science and Engineering (IGSSE, Project PhosForest 12.10) and by the Bavarian State Chancellery (Project Amazon‐FLUX).

While many regions still experience N shortages, agriculture is the leading global emitter of N2 O due to losses exacerbated by N surpluses in other regions. In order to sustainably maintain or increase food production, farmers and their advisors need a comprehensive and actionable understanding of how nutrient management affects both yield and N2 O emissions, particularly in tropical and subtropical agroecosystems. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the effect of N management and other factors on N2 O emissions, plant N uptake, and yield. Our analysis demonstrates that performance indicators-partial N balance and partial factor productivity-predicted N2 O emissions as well as or better than N rate. While we observed consistent production and environmental benefits with enhanced-efficiency fertilizers, we noted potential trade-offs between yield and N2 O emissions for fertilizer placement. Furthermore, we observed confounding effects due to management dynamics that co-vary with nutrient application practices, thus challenging the interpretation of the effect of specific practices such as fertilization frequency. Therefore, rather than providing universally prescriptive management for N2 O emission reduction, our evidence supports mitigation strategies based upon tailored nutrient management approaches that keep N balances within safe limits, so as to minimize N2 O emissions while still achieving high crop yields. The limited evidence available suggests that these relationships hold for temperate, tropical, and subtropical regions, but given the potential for expansion of N use in crop production, further N2 O data collection should be prioritized in under-represented regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa.",,"Funding information This work was carried out by International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and funded by the CGIAR research programs (CRPs) on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).

However, global patterns and drivers of soil gross immobilization of ammonium (INH4 ) and nitrate (INO3 ) are still only tentatively known. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis considering gross N production rates, soil properties, and climate and their interactions for a deeper understanding of the patterns and drivers of INH4 and INO3 . By compiling and analyzing 1966 observations from 274 15 N-labelled studies, we found a global average of INH4 and INO3 of 7.41 ± 0.72 and 2.03 ± 0.30 mg N kg-1  day-1 with a ratio of INO3 to INH4 (INO3 :INH4 ) of 0.79 ± 0.11. Soil INH4 and INO3 increased with increasing soil gross N mineralization (GNM) and nitrification (GN), microbial biomass, organic carbon, and total N and decreasing soil bulk density. Our analysis revealed that GNM and GN were the main stimulators for INH4 and INO3 , respectively. The structural equation modeling showed that higher soil microbial biomass, total N, pH, and precipitation stimulate INH4 and INO3 through enhancing GNM and GN. However, higher temperature and soil bulk density suppress INH4 and INO3 by reducing microbial biomass and total N. Soil INH4 varied with terrestrial ecosystems, being greater in grasslands and forests, which have higher rates of GNM, than in croplands. The highest INO3 :INH4 was observed in croplands, which had higher rates of GN. The global average of GN to INH4 was 2.86 ± 0.31, manifesting a high potential risk of N loss. We highlight that anthropogenic activities that influence soil properties and gross N production rates likely interact with future climate changes and land uses to affect soil N immobilization and, eventually, the fate of the anthropogenic reactive N.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare no competing financial interests.,"Funding information Financial support for this work was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42122055, 42150410380, 41977081, and 41977032).",Global Change Biology,,,Ammonium Compounds; Ecosystem; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Oxides; Soil; Soil Microbiology,2022-05-02,2022,2022-05-02,2022-07,28,14,4472-4488,Closed,Article,"Elrys, Ahmed S.; Chen, Zhaoxiong; Wang, Jing; Uwiragiye, Yves; Helmy, Ayman M.; Desoky, El‐Sayed M.; Cheng, Yi; Zhang, Jin‐bo; Cai, Zu‐cong; Müller, Christoph","Elrys, Ahmed S.

However, the effects of different ecological restoration projects on multiple ecosystem services are poorly understood, inhibiting our ability to maximize ecosystem services for further restoration. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the impact of different ecological projects on ecosystem services (carbon storage, water conservation, soil retention), using a pairwise comparative study of samples from 90 project-control pairs in the Tibetan Plateau. Our results found that afforestation increased carbon storage (31.3%) and soil retention (37.6%), but the effects of grassland restoration on services were mixed, while the overall changes in water conservation were negligible. Prior land use/measures and the age of project implementation were key factors in regulating ecosystem service responses. For example, afforestation on bare land increased carbon storage and soil retention but indirectly decreased water conservation by influencing vegetation cover, while cropland afforestation increased water and soil retention. Ecosystem services increased with project age after afforestation. For grassland restoration, short-term recovery increased carbon storage but was not effective in improving water and soil retention. Climate and topography also directly or indirectly controlled the response of ecosystem services by affecting the changes in total nitrogen, total porosity, clay and fractional vegetation cover following the projects. This study improves our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the responses of ecosystem services to afforestation and grassland restoration. Our results suggest that sustainable restoration management taking into account prior land use/measures, implementation age, climate, topography and other resources is critical for optimizing ecosystem services.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Therefore, it is necessary to understand the absorption and transport of Cd soil by leafy vegetables. In this study, the meta-analysis method was firstly employed to study the relationship of Cd in leafy vegetables and soil systems. The results showed that different kinds of leafy vegetables have different abilities of Cd accumulation (measured by bioconcentration factor (BCF)) and transportation (measured by translocation factor (TF)): Brassica juncea (BCF = 5.10) and Brassica pekinensis (BCF = 1.90) had significantly higher ability to absorb cadmium in soil among the 19 studied species, Brassica pekinensis (TF = 2.52), Coriandrum sativum (TF = 2.18) had significantly higher cadmium transport capacity than other 11 species. To further clarify the influence of the three main factors of soil pH, Cd content and leafy vegetable species on the Cd enrichment ability of leafy vegetables, the regression equation was obtained by meta-regression analysis. BCF is affected by species, soil pH, soil cadmium content in the order from high to low. It was found that the estimated range of SOM for safe production of leafy vegetables is 20-30 g/kg. It could also be observed that soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) had a negative correlation with BCF, while soil salinity had a strong positive correlation with BCF. This study can provide a reliable reference for leafy vegetable security production in the Cd polluted field and aids in selecting species suitable for avoiding the absorption of heavy metals from polluted soil.",This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of China (No. 2017YFD0801104) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41771345).,,Environmental Pollution,,,"Cadmium; China; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Vegetables",2020-04-30,2020,2020-04-30,2020-09,264,,114677,Closed,Article,"Huang, Lukuan; Wang, Qiong; Zhou, Qiyao; Ma, Luyao; Wu, Yingjie; Liu, Qizhen; Wang, Sheng; Feng, Ying","Huang, Lukuan (MOE Key Laboratory of Environment Remediation and Ecological Health, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China.); Wang, Qiong (MOE Key Laboratory of Environment Remediation and Ecological Health, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China.); Zhou, Qiyao (MOE Key Laboratory of Environment Remediation and Ecological Health, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China.); Ma, Luyao (MOE Key Laboratory of Environment Remediation and Ecological Health, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China.); Wu, Yingjie (MOE Key Laboratory of Environment Remediation and Ecological Health, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China.); Liu, Qizhen (MOE Key Laboratory of Environment Remediation and Ecological Health, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China.); Wang, Sheng (Laboratory of Pomology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.); Feng, Ying (MOE Key Laboratory of Environment Remediation and Ecological Health, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China.

How soil P availability responds to changes in plant diversity remains uncertain, despite the global crisis of rapid biodiversity loss. Our meta-analysis based on 180 studies across various ecosystems (croplands, grasslands, forests and pot experiments) shows that, on average, soil total P, phosphatase activity and available P are 6.8%, 8.5% and 4.6%, respectively, higher in species mixtures than in monocultures. The mixture effect on phosphatase activity becomes more positive with increasing species and functional group richness, with more pronounced increases in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. The mixture effects on soil-available P in the bulk soil do not change, but with increasing species or functional group richness these effects in the rhizosphere soil shift from positive to negative. Nonetheless, enhanced soil phosphatase activity stimulated available P in diverse species mixtures, offsetting increased plant uptake effects that decrease soil-available P. Moreover, the enhancement effects of species richness on soil phosphatase activity are positively associated with increased plant productivity. Our findings highlight that preserving plant diversity could increase soil phosphatase activity and P availability, which sustain the current and future productivity of terrestrial ecosystems.",We thank the Discovery Grants program (grant no.

To combat the presence of heavy metals (HMs) in the agrarian system, biochar becomes an attractive approach for stabilizing and limiting availability of HMs in soils due to its high surface area, porosity, pH, aromatic structure as well as several functional groups, which mostly rely on the feedstock and pyrolysis temperature. Additionally, agricultural waste-derived biochar is an effective management option to ensure carbon neutrality and circular economy while also addressing social and environmental concerns. Given these diverse parameters, the present systematic evaluation seeks to (i) ascertain the effectiveness of heavy metal immobilization by agro waste-derived biochar; (ii) examine the presence of biochar on soil physico-chemical, and thermal properties, along with microbial diversity; (iii) explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for the reduction in heavy metal concentration; and (iv) possibility of biochar implications to advance circular economy approach. The collection of more than 200 papers catalogues the immobilization efficiency of biochar in agricultural soil and its impacts on soil from multi-angle perspectives. The data gathered suggests that pristine biochar effectively reduced cationic heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Ni) and Cr mobilization and uptake by plants, whereas modified biochar effectively reduced As in soil and plant systems. However, the exact mechanism underlying is a complex biochar-soil interaction. In addition to successfully immobilizing heavy metals in the soil, the application of biochar improved soil fertility and increased agricultural productivity. However, the lack of knowledge on unfavorable impacts on the agricultural systems, along with discrepancies between the use of biochar and experimental conditions, impeded a thorough understanding on a deeper level.","The first author would like to thank the Jaypee Institute of Information Technology for providing support in the form of research fellowship.

Plant shoot and root litter is important in mediating these positive relationships, yet the functional role of plant litter remains overlooked in long-term experiments. We propose that plant litter strengthens biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships over time in four ways by providing decomposing detritus that releases nitrogen (N) over time for uptake by existing and succeeding plants, enhancing overall soil fertility, changing soil community composition, and reducing the impact of residue-borne pathogens and pests. We bring new insights into how diversity-productivity relationships may change over time and suggest that the diversification of crop residue retention through increased residue diversity from plant mixtures will improve the sustainability of food production systems.","Acknowledgments We thank S.Y.

Despite the negative impacts of drought on terrestrial C cycling, our understanding of the responses of above- and belowground productivity to drought remains incomplete. Here, we synthesized the responses of terrestrial productivity and soil factors (e.g., soil moisture, soil pH, soil C, soil nitrogen (N), soil C:N, fungi:bacteria ratio, and microbial biomass C) to drought via a global meta-analysis of 734 observations from 107 studies. Our results revealed that the productivity variables above- and belowground (i.e., net primary productivity, aboveground net primary productivity, belowground net primary productivity, total biomass, aboveground biomass, root biomass, gross ecosystem productivity, and net ecosystem productivity) were decreased across all ecosystems. However, drought did not significantly affect litter mass across all ecosystems, and the responses of above- and belowground productivity to drought were non-uniform. Furthermore, the responses of these productivity variables to drought were more pronounced with drought intensity and duration, and consistent across ecosystem types and background climates. Drought significantly decreased soil moisture, soil C concentrations, soil C:N ratios, and microbial biomass C, whereas it enhanced soil pH values and fungi:bacteria ratios. Moreover, the negative effects of drought on above- and belowground productivity variables were correlated mostly with the response of soil pH to drought among all soil factors. Our study indicated that litter biomass, which mostly represents productivity levels via traditional ecosystem models, was not able to predict the responses of terrestrial ecosystem productivity to drought. The strong relationship between the responses of soil pH and terrestrial productivity to drought suggests that the incorporation of soil pH into Earth system models might facilitate the prediction of terrestrial C cycling and its feedbacks to drought.",This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 32071594) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFD0600204).,,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Biomass; Droughts; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Soil,2021-04-05,2021,2021-04-05,2021-08,782,,146901,Closed,Article,"Wang, Cuiting; Sun, Yuan; Chen, Han Y H; Yang, Jinyan; Ruan, Honghua","Wang, Cuiting (Department of Ecology, Co-Innovation Center for Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China.); Sun, Yuan (Department of Ecology, Co-Innovation Center for Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Bioresources of Saline Soils, Jiangsu Synthetic Innovation Center for Coastal Bio-agriculture, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Coastal Wetland Bioresources and Environmental Protection, Yancheng Teachers University, Yancheng City, China.); Chen, Han Y H (Faculty of Natural Resource Management, Lakehead University, 955 Oliver Road, Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada; Key Laboratory for Humid Subtropical Eco-Geographical Processes of the Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fujian, China.); Yang, Jinyan (Department of Ecology, Co-Innovation Center for Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China.); Ruan, Honghua (Department of Ecology, Co-Innovation Center for Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China.

5937,pub.1148795601,10.1002/ecy.3790,35718753,,Global pattern of soil priming effect intensity and its environmental drivers,"The microbial priming effect-the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) induced by plant inputs-has long been considered an important driver of SOC dynamics, yet we have limited understanding about the direction, intensity, and drivers of priming across ecosystem types and biomes. This gap hinders our ability to predict how shifts in litter inputs under global change can affect climate feedbacks. Here, we synthesized 18,919 observations of CO2 effluxes in 802 soils across the globe to test the relative effects (i.e., log response ratio [RR]) of litter additions on native SOC decomposition and identified the dominant environmental drivers in natural ecosystems and agricultural lands. Globally, litter additions enhanced native SOC decomposition (RR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.32-0.38), with greater priming effects occurring with decreasing latitude and more in agricultural soils (RR = 0.43) than in uncultivated soils (RR = 0.28). In natural ecosystems, soil pH and microbial community composition (e.g., bacteria: fungi ratio) were the best predictors of priming, with greater effects occurring in acidic, bacteria-dominated sandy soils. In contrast, the substrate properties of plant litter and soils were the most important drivers of priming in agricultural systems since soils with high C:N ratios and those receiving large inputs of low-quality litter had the highest priming effects. Collectively, our results suggest that, though different factors may control priming effects, the ubiquitous nature of priming means that alterations of litter quality and quantity owing to global changes will likely have consequences for global C cycling and climate forcing.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 31801318) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2018M641028).

Little is known about N input and its impact in orchards at the global scale. Therefore, in this study we systematically evaluated reactive nitrogen (Nr) loss in global orchards. A meta-analysis of 97 studies reported from 2000 to 2021 from different countries showed that the mean global N fertilizer input in orchards was 303 kg N ha-1 yr-1, and the estimated emission factor (EF) of nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3) were 1.39% and 3.64%, respectively. Also, during the same period, orchard nitrate leaching factor (LF) reached 18.5%, and the runoff N loss factor (RF) and net fruit N removal factor (NRF) were estimated to be 2.75% and 5.31%, respectively. The apparent N balance of the global orchard system reached 68.4% of N input. N application increased the Nr loss in various pathways in the orchard. The N2O and NH3 emission and nitrate leaching were linearly correlated with N fertilizer application, and overuse of N resulted in substantial Nr loss. Regionally, the total Nr loss in developing countries was higher than developed countries. Average N input (405 kg N ha-1 yr-1) and Nr loss (102 kg N ha-1 yr-1) of orchards in Asia were the highest. The NH3 volatilization and runoff N loss of deciduous orchards were significantly higher than that of evergreen orchards. N application increased fruit yield, but excessive N input reduced the net fruit N removal (FNR). The results reported here fill an important knowledge gap of N balance analysis of orchards at a global scale and provided a framework for optimizing N management to achieve sustainable fruit production.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Such replacement must be deemed sustainable from agronomic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission perspectives. For agronomic performance several controlled protocols are in place but not for testing GHG emissions. Herein, a pre-screening tool is presented to examine GHG emissions from bio-waste as fertilizers. The various treatments examined are as follows: soil with added mineral nitrogen (N, 140 kg N ha-1) fertilizer (MF), the same amount of MF combined with dairy processing sludge (DS), sludge-derived biochar produced at 450 °C (BC450) and 700 °C (BC700) and untreated control (CK). These treatments were combined with Danish (sandy loam) or Irish (clay loam) soils, with carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and soil inorganic-N contents measured on selected days. During the incubation, biochar mitigated N2O emissions by regulating denitrification. BC450 reduced N2O emissions from Danish soil by 95.5% and BC700 by 97.7% compared to emissions with the sludge application, and for Irish soil, the N2O reductions were 93.6% and 32.3%, respectively. For both soils, biochar reduced CO2 emissions by 50% as compared to the sludge. The lower N2O reduction potential of BC700 for Irish soil could be due to the high soil organic carbon and clay content and pyrolysis temperature. For the same reasons emissions of N2O and CO2 from Irish soil were significantly higher than from Danish soil. The temporal variation in N2O emissions was correlated with soil inorganic-N contents. The CH4 emissions across treatments were not significantly different. This study developed a simple and cost-effective pre-screening method to evaluate the GHG emission potential of new bio-waste before its field application and guide the development of national emission inventories, towards achieving the goals of circular economy and the European Green Deal.","This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Innovative Training Networks (ITN) under the agreement REFLOW No 814258.

Yet, its impacts on crop yields remains controversial. To gain further insight, we mapped the probability of yield gain when switching from conventional tillage systems (CT) to CA worldwide. Relative yield changes were estimated with machine learning algorithms trained by 4403 paired yield observations on 8 crop species extracted from 413 publications. CA has better productive performance than no-till system (NT), and it stands a more than 50% chance to outperform CT in dryer regions of the world, especially with proper agricultural management practices. Residue retention has the largest positive impact on CA productivity comparing to other management practices. The variations in the productivity of CA and NT across geographical and climatical regions were illustrated on global maps. CA appears as a sustainable agricultural practice if targeted at specific climatic regions and crop species.","This work was supported by the ANR under the “Investissements d’avenir” program with the reference ANR-16-CONV-0003 (CLAND).

This study conducts a meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed literature on the outcomes of mangrove restoration. On aggregate, restored mangroves provide higher ecosystem functions than unvegetated tidal flats but lower than natural mangrove stands (respectively RR’ = 0.43, 95%CIs = 0.23 to 0.63; RR’ = −0.21, 95%CIs = −0.34 to −0.08), while they perform on par with naturally-regenerated mangroves and degraded mangroves. However, restoration outcomes vary widely between functions and comparative bases, and are mediated by factors such as restoration age, species, and restoration method. Furthermore, mangrove restoration offers positive benefit-cost ratios ranging from 10.50 to 6.83 under variable discount rates (−2% to 8%), suggesting that mangrove restoration is a cost-effective form of ecosystem management. Overall, the results suggest that mangrove restoration has substantial potential to contribute to multiple policy objectives related to biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and sustainable development.","This work is financially supported by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (193156), and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Kakenhi B 19H04323).

However, the influence of plastic residues and microplastics (MPs) in soil ecosystems remains unclear. We conducted a global meta-analysis to quantify the effect of plastic residues and MPs on indicators of global soil ecosystem functioning (i.e. soil physicochemical properties, plant and soil animal health, abundance and diversity of soil microorganisms). Concentrations of plastic residues and MPs were 1-2700 kg ha-1 and 0.01-600,000 mg kg-1, respectively, based on 6223 observations. Results show that plastic residues and MPs can decrease soil wetting front vertical and horizontal movement, dissolved organic carbon, and total nitrogen content of soil by 14%, 10%, 9%, and 7%, respectively. Plant height and root biomass were decreased by 13% and 14% in the presence of plastic residues and MPs, while the body mass and reproduction rate of soil animals decreased by 5% and 11%, respectively. However, soil enzyme activity increased by 7%441% in the presence of plastic residues and MPs. For soil microorganisms, plastic residues and MPs can change the abundance of several bacteria phyla and families, but the effects vary between different bacteria.","This research was supported by the UKRI Global Challenges Research Fund and the Natural Environment Research Council project, “Do agricultural microplastics undermine food security and sustainable development in less economically developed countries?” (GCRF, Project NE/V005871/1), and the High-level Team Project of China Agricultural University.

As increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition can alter the nutrient balance in natural ecosystems, we assessed the response of RAF communities to a fertilization experiment deployed on a highly diverse Andean forest. The stand level fine root fraction was sampled after 7 years of systematic N and P additions and RAF communities were characterized by a deep sequencing approach. We expected that fertilization will enhance competition of fungal taxa for limiting nutrients, thus eliciting diversity reductions and alterations in the structure of RAF communities. Fertilization treatments did not reduce RAF richness but affected community composition. At the phylum level fertilization reduced richness exclusively among Glomeromycota. In contrast, N and P additions (alone or in combination) altered the composition of several fungal phyla. The lack of a generalized response to long-term fertilization among RAF lineages suggests that most of these lineages will not be directly and immediately affected by the increasing rates of atmospheric N and P deposition expected for this region by 2050.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors acknowledge the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, grant no.

5921,pub.1154681625,10.1111/gcb.16604,36655298,,Altered activities of extracellular soil enzymes by the interacting global environmental changes,"Soil enzymes are crucial in mediating ecosystems' responses to environmental drivers, so that the comprehension of their sensitivity to drivers of global change can help make predictions of future scenarios and design tailored interventions of biomanipulation. Drivers of global change usually act in combination of two or more, and indirect effects of one driver acting through modification of another one often occur, yet most of both manipulative and meta-analysis studies available tend to focus on the direct effect of one single driver on the activity of specific soil enzymes. One of the biggest challenges is, therefore, represented by the difficulty in assessing the interactions between different drivers, due to the complexity of disentangling the single direct effects from the indirect and combined ones. In this review, after elucidating the general mechanisms of soil enzyme production and activity regulation, we display the state-of-the-art knowledge on direct, indirect and combined effects of the main drivers of global change on soil enzyme activities, identify gaps in knowledge and challenges from research, plus we analyse how this can reverberate in the future of biomanipulation techniques for the improvement of ecosystem services. We conclude that qualitative but not quantitative outcomes can be predicted for some interactions such as warming + drought or warming + CO2 , while for other ones, the results are controversial: future basic research will have to center on this holistic approach. A general trend toward the overall increase of soil enzyme activities and acceleration of biogeochemical cycles will persist, until an inflection will be caused by factors such as future shifts in microbial communities and changes in carbon use efficiency. Applied research will develop toward the refinement of ""in situ"" analytical systems for the study of soil enzyme activities and the support of bioengineering for the better tailoring of interventions of biomanipulation.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflict of interest nor any competing interests.,,Global Change Biology,,,Ecosystem; Climate Change; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Droughts; Microbiota,2023-02-12,2023,2023-02-12,2023-04,29,8,2067-2091,Closed,Article,"Zuccarini, Paolo; Sardans, Jordi; Asensio, Loles; Peñuelas, Josep","Zuccarini, Paolo (CREAF‐CSIC, Bellaterra, Spain); Sardans, Jordi (CREAF‐CSIC, Bellaterra, Spain); Asensio, Loles (CREAF‐CSIC, Bellaterra, Spain); Peñuelas, Josep (CREAF‐CSIC, Bellaterra, Spain)","Zuccarini, Paolo ","Zuccarini, Paolo (); Sardans, Jordi (); Asensio, Loles (); Peñuelas, Josep ()",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154681625,31 Biological Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4101 Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation,

Forest gaps and slope aspect are important factors in the regeneration of Chinese pine by influencing light and moisture, but what these effects are is still up for debate. Meanwhile, the effects of forest gaps and slope aspect are poorly studied in response to different forest types and ages, as well as temperature and precipitation. We established literature selection criteria that finally identified 101 and 69 pairs of study cases on forest gaps and slope aspect, respectively. The overall effect values were obtained by meta-analysis and found that gap and shady slope habitats had significant positive effects on the regeneration density of Chinese pine (P < 0.05). The gap most enhanced the regeneration density in a plantation setting (P < 0.05). In pure stands of Chinese pine, shady slopes can significantly increase regeneration density (P < 0.05). Forest gaps and shady slopes contributed most to Chinese pine regeneration density in mature stands compared to near mature stands, and over mature stands (P < 0.05). There was no significant effect of stand gap size on regeneration density (P > 0.05). In particular, the edges of the gap appeared to be well-suited for regeneration (P < 0.05). In our study area, mean annual precipitation resulted in a significant increase in the effects of the gap and shady slope as precipitation declined (P < 0.05). This meta-analysis helps elucidate the effects of forest gap (position or area) and slope aspect on Chinese pine regeneration. With global climate change, Chinese pine regeneration may prefer the edge of forest gaps and shady slopes.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We used this database to analyse how soil loss by sheet and rill erosion and runoff in China were affected by land use, slope gradient, slope length and mean annual precipitation. Our results show that land use dominates the variation of soil loss and runoff: Soil loss and runoff rates on land covered by grass and trees are one to three orders of magnitude lower than rates on cropland. Slope gradient and slope length affect soil loss and runoff rates on cropland but there is no statistically significant effect on either soil loss or runoff on plots with a permanent vegetation cover. Runoff rates consistently increase with mean annual precipitation. The relationship between soil loss and mean annual precipitation is, on the contrary, nonlinear for all land use types, with a clear increase of soil loss with precipitation up to a mean annual precipitation of ca. 700 mm yr-1, a subsequent decline and a second rise when the mean annual precipitation exceeds ca. 1400 mm yr-1. We attribute this non-linear response to the interplay of an increasing rainfall erosivity and an increasing protection due to vegetation cover with increasing mean annual precipitation. This non-linear response implies that the effect of precipitation changes induced by climate change on the erosion risk depends on how both rainfall erosivity and vegetation cover change with changing climate. Our study provides important insights as to how soil loss and runoff in China are related to controlling factors and this will allow improving assessments of total soil erosion and runoff rates over the entire territory of China.","We thank the editor and three anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions to improve this manuscript.

Land use type probably is a key factor that drives the contamination level of soil MPs. Nevertheless, few studies have performed large-scale systematic analysis of the effects in different agricultural land soils on the MPs abundance. In this study, we constructed a national MPs dataset comprising 321 observations from 28 articles, summarised the current status of microplastic pollution in five agricultural land types in China through meta-analysis, and investigated the effects and key factors of agricultural land types on microplastic abundance. The results showed that among the existing soil microplastic research, vegetable soils maintained a higher environmental exposure distribution than other agricultural lands, and with the most common trend being vegetable land > orchard land > cropland > grassland. By combining agricultural practices, demographic economic factors and geographical factors, a potential impact identification method based on subgroup analysis was established. The findings demonstrated that agricultural film mulch significantly increased soil MPs abundance, especially in orchards. Increased population and economy (carbon emissions and PM2.5 concentrations) add MPs abundance in all kinds of agricultural lands. And the significant changes of effect sizes in high-latitude and mid-altitude areas suggested that geographical space differences exerted a certain degree of impact on the soil distribution of MPs. By the proposed method, different levels of MPs risk areas in agricultural soils can be more reasonably and effectively identified, which will provide type-specific policies technical and theoretical support for the precise management of MPs in agricultural land soils.","Declaration of competing interest All authors declare that there are no competing interests, financial or otherwise.

PFAS can be distinguished, among other things, by their different carbon chain lengths and functional groups. The aim of this study was to provide comprehensive evidence on PFAS transfer rates across the human placental barrier by means of a meta-analysis based upon a systematic review. The available literature up to April 2021 was reviewed and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PFAS assessed. A total of 39 studies reporting data on 20 PFAS were included in the systematic review. Of these, 20 studies with data on 19 compounds were included in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v3.0) was used for quantitative, statistical analyses with random effects models. A curvilinear relationship was found with short and long chains of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) exhibiting higher TTE than compounds with intermediate chain length. Among the less well studied PFAS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), 6:2 fluorotelomersulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) stood out the most with a high TEEs. The dependence of TTEs on chain length and functional group is clearly shown in this first meta-analysis on PFAS transfer across the human placenta. More data on effects of less well studied PFAS in pregnant women and neonates are needed to assess the potential risk for fetal exposure.",All individuals who contributed to this work have been listed as authors.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health Part B,,,"Caproates; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Placenta; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects",2021-12-20,2021,2021-12-20,2022-01-02,25,1,23-42,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Appel, Mareike; Forsthuber, Martin; Ramos, Romualdo; Widhalm, Raimund; Granitzer, Sebastian; Uhl, Maria; Hengstschläger, Markus; Stamm, Tanja; Gundacker, Claudia","Appel, Mareike (Center for Pathobiochemistry and Genetics, Institute of Medical Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Mareike Appel and Martin Forsthuber have contributed equally to this work (shared first authorship).); Forsthuber, Martin (Center for Pathobiochemistry and Genetics, Institute of Medical Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Department of Environmental Health, Medical University of Vienna, Center for Public Health, Vienna, Austria; Mareike Appel and Martin Forsthuber have contributed equally to this work (shared first authorship).); Ramos, Romualdo (Centre for Medical Statistic, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Institute of Outcomes Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria); Widhalm, Raimund (Center for Pathobiochemistry and Genetics, Institute of Medical Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Karl-Landsteiner Private University for Health Sciences, Krems an der Donau, Austria); Granitzer, Sebastian (Center for Pathobiochemistry and Genetics, Institute of Medical Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Karl-Landsteiner Private University for Health Sciences, Krems an der Donau, Austria); Uhl, Maria (Environment Agency Austria, Vienna, Austria); Hengstschläger, Markus (Center for Pathobiochemistry and Genetics, Institute of Medical Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria); Stamm, Tanja (Centre for Medical Statistic, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Institute of Outcomes Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria); Gundacker, Claudia (Center for Pathobiochemistry and Genetics, Institute of Medical Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria)","Forsthuber, Martin (Medical University of Vienna; Medical University of Vienna; )","Appel, Mareike (Medical University of Vienna); Forsthuber, Martin (Medical University of Vienna; Medical University of Vienna); Ramos, Romualdo (Medical University of Vienna); Widhalm, Raimund (Medical University of Vienna; Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences); Granitzer, Sebastian (Medical University of Vienna; Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences); Uhl, Maria (Environment Agency Austria); Hengstschläger, Markus (Medical University of Vienna); Stamm, Tanja (Medical University of Vienna); Gundacker, Claudia (Medical University of Vienna)",15,15,4.08,13.98,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10937404.2021.2009946?needAccess=true,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144063297,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine,

Design theory has been an alternative to promote changes and develop more sustainable strategies that allow pastoral livestock production systems to evolve continually within grasslands by enhancing their health and enabling the continuous delivery of multiple ecosystem services. To create a design framework to design alternative and more sustainable pastoral livestock production systems, a better comprehension of grassland complexity and dynamism for a diagnostic assessment of its health is needed, from which the systems thinking theory could be an important approach. By using systems thinking theory, the key components of grasslands-soil, plant, ruminant-can be reviewed and better understood from a holistic perspective. The description of soil, plant and ruminant individually is already complex itself, so understanding these components, their interactions, their response to grazing management and herbivory and how they contribute to grassland health under different climatic and topographic conditions is paramount to designing more sustainable pastoral livestock production systems. Therefore, by taking a systems thinking approach, we aim to review the literature to better understand the role of soil, plant, and ruminant on grassland health to build a design framework to diagnose and enhance grassland health under pastoral livestock production systems.",,"This research was funded by the Centre of Excellence, Designing Future Productive Landscapes, Lincoln University (4350 AGLS—INT 4908 AGLS—113043), and by the John Barnes Postgraduate Scholarship from Lincoln University.",Animals,,Donald C Beitz,,2022-11-26,2022,2022-11-26,,12,23,3306,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pereira, Fabiellen C.; Smith, Carol M.

As organic farming refrains from using synthetic inputs, it heavenly relies on maintaining soil health. However, it is still poorly understood how organic management performs in terms of maintaining soil health in real commercial and heterogeneous farm settings as compared to conventional management, and especially as compared to a natural reference system. Here, we compared a set of soil health indicators among 24 commercial apple orchards that were either managed organically or conventionally using Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices. In addition, we quantified the same indicators in 12 semi-natural grasslands as a benchmark to assess to what extent soil processes and functions have been degraded due to agricultural practices. As soil heath indicators, we quantified soil bulk density, organic matter content, organic carbon content, organic carbon stock, total nitrogen (N), potential heterotrophic respiration, potential net N mineralization, litter decomposition and litter stabilization, and we added the diversity of the herbaceous vegetation and the soil microbiome as covariates in our models. We found no differences between organic and IPM orchards, and neither of the farming systems showed evidence of impaired soil health compared to the semi-natural benchmark, with the exception of higher decomposition rates measured in both orchard types. We observed, however, high spatial variation in soil health between drive and crop rows within the orchards. Especially in the IPM orchards, crop rows showed impaired soil health compared to the adjacent drive rows, indicating that there is still opportunity to improve soil management in the IPM system. In addition, our results show that a considerable part of the variation in soil characteristics can be attributed to the study site, suggesting that both natural heterogeneity and personal management preferences by individual farmers are more important than the management system. Overall, and at least in terms of the soil variables measured in this study, our results suggest that perennial crop systems can be managed in a sustainable way, without jeopardizing soil health.","We are grateful to all orchardists who participated in this study and allowed sampling in their orchards.

Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) are threatened by microplastics. Although substantial studies have explored the dynamics and threats of microplastics in BCEs, the fate and driving factors of microplastics in BCEs on a global scale remain largely unknown. Here, the occurrence, driving factors, and risks of microplastics in global BCEs were investigated by synthesizing a global meta-analysis. The results showed that the abundance of microplastics in BCEs has notable spatial differences worldwide, with the highest microplastic concentrations in Asia, especially in South and Southeast Asia. Microplastic abundance is influenced by the vegetation habitat, climate, coastal environment, and river runoff. The interaction of geographic location, ecosystem type, coastal environment, and climate enhanced the effects of microplastic distribution. In addition, we found that microplastic accumulation in organisms varied according to feeding habits and body weight. Significant accumulation was observed in large fish; however, growth dilution effects were also observed. The effect of microplastics on the organic carbon content of sediments from BCEs varies by ecosystem; microplastic concentrations do not necessarily increase organic carbon sequestration. Global BCEs are at a high risk of microplastic pollution, with high microplastic abundance and toxicity driving the high pollution risk. Finally, this review provides scientific evidence that will form the basis for future microplastic research, focusing on the transport of microplastics in BCEs; effects on the growth, development, and primary productivity of blue carbon plants; and soil biogeochemical cycles.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Experimental treatments applied 20 years prior to the wildfires included factorial combinations of 1) organic matter (OM) removal following clear-cut harvesting (SO, stem only harvest, WTH, whole-tree harvest, and WTH + FF, WTH plus the forest floor removal), 2) soil compaction (three levels of intensity), and 3) with and without understory vegetation control. Wildfires caused complete losses of the forest floor in all treatments and also oxidized varying portions of OM in the topsoil. As such, pre-fire forest floor measures were used as an estimate of forest floor C and N loss, and post-fire soil measures of C and N were compared to pre-fire soil data to estimate of mineral soil losses. Averaged over all treatments, the less-productive site that also had lesser accumulations of detritus (Wallace) lost 35.1 Mg C ha-1, or 25 % of its original C stores, while the more-productive site with greater detritus (Rogers) lost 18.4 Mg C ha-1, or 20 % of its original. The SO treatments that left harvest residue on site ended up with much greater losses of C: 36 % versus 15 and 17 % for WTH and WTH + FF, respectively. The SO also yielded the largest losses (25-30 %) of C in the top 10-cm of soil. The other treatments had smaller or inconsistent effects (understory vegetation control) or no effect (soil compaction). Our results suggest that potential benefits from SO by leaving residue on site to soil C and N accumulation can also be readily eliminated by wildfire which commonly occurs at these fire-prone forest ecosystems.","We acknowledge the late Robert F.

Here we conduct a state-of-the-art estimate of the spatial-temporal variability of GHG emissions intensities for wheat, maize, and rice in China from 1949 to 2012 using an improved agricultural ecosystem model (Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model-Agriculture Version 2.0) and meta-analysis covering 172 field-GHG emissions experiments. The results show that the GHG emissions intensities of these croplands from 1949 to 2012, on average, were 0.10-1.31 kg CO2 -eq/kg, with a significant increase rate of 1.84-3.58 × 10-3  kg CO2 -eq kg-1  year-1 . Nitrogen fertilizer was the dominant factor contributing to the increase in GHG emissions intensity in northern China and increased its impact in southern China in the 2000s. Increasing GHG emissions intensity implies that excessive fertilizer failed to markedly stimulate crop yield increase in China but still exacerbated soil GHG emissions. This study found that overfertilization of more than 60% was mainly located in the winter wheat-summer maize rotation systems in the North China Plain, the winter wheat-rice rotation systems in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and southwest China, and most of the double rice systems in the South. Our simulations suggest that roughly a one-third reduction in the current N fertilizer application level over these ""overfertilization"" regions would not significantly influence crop yield but decrease soil GHG emissions by 29.60%-32.50% and GHG emissions intensity by 0.13-0.25 kg CO2 -eq/kg. This reduction is about 29% and 5% of total agricultural soil GHG emissions in China and the world, respectively. This study suggests that improving nitrogen use efficiency would be an effective strategy to mitigate GHG emissions and sustain China's food security.","We thank Dr. G. S.

Biodiversity faces the sixth mass extinction. Crop yields are plateauing. Against this crisis narrative swells a clarion call for Regenerative Agriculture. But what is Regenerative Agriculture, and why is it gaining such prominence? Which problems does it solve, and how? Here we address these questions from an agronomic perspective. The term Regenerative Agriculture has actually been in use for some time, but there has been a resurgence of interest over the past 5 years. It is supported from what are often considered opposite poles of the debate on agriculture and food. Regenerative Agriculture has been promoted strongly by civil society and NGOs as well as by many of the major multi-national food companies. Many practices promoted as regenerative, including crop residue retention, cover cropping and reduced tillage are central to the canon of 'good agricultural practices', while others are contested and at best niche (e.g. permaculture, holistic grazing). Worryingly, these practices are generally promoted with little regard to context. Practices most often encouraged (such as no tillage, no pesticides or no external nutrient inputs) are unlikely to lead to the benefits claimed in all places. We argue that the resurgence of interest in Regenerative Agriculture represents a re-framing of what have been considered to be two contrasting approaches to agricultural futures, namely agroecology and sustainable intensification, under the same banner. This is more likely to confuse than to clarify the public debate. More importantly, it draws attention away from more fundamental challenges. We conclude by providing guidance for research agronomists who want to engage with Regenerative Agriculture.",We thank David Powlson and Matthew Kessler for their critical reviews of an earlier version of this manuscript.

A systematic review,"In this paper, a systematic review approach was used to evaluate how environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been applied in agroforestry in the context of food systems. This review was used as the basis for discussing methodological issues in the LCA framework for agroforestry systems (AFS) and relevant environmental outcomes in the agroforestry literature. A total of 32 LCAs in 17 countries identified in four databases and spanning a decade form the basis for this paper. Studies were selected based on pre-defined inclusion criteria and followed established guidelines and a review protocol. Qualitative data were extracted and categorized into multiple themes. Results were quantitatively synthesized for the four phases of the LCA for each individual agroforestry practice (i.e., based on its structural composition). Results showed that around half of the selected studies are located in tropical climates, the rest being in temperate climates, predominantly in Southern Europe. Studies primarily used a mass functional unit and rarely included post-farm gate system boundaries. Almost half of the studies account for multifunctionality, and most allocation methods were based on physical properties. Climate change had the greatest coverage from all impact categories with some variations within milk, meat, and crop production systems. Methodological issues were related to limited system boundaries, few impact categories, and differing functional units and multifunctionality approaches. The identified effects of AFS on biodiversity, climate change mitigation, water, soil, pollination, and pest and disease were only partially documented or not analyzed in the LCA studies or the LCA framework. Gaps in knowledge and limitations of the present review were discussed. Further methodological improvements remain necessary to determine the net environmental effects of food products resulting from individual AFS, especially within the area of multifunctionality, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that this publication is free from any known conflicts of interest.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been extensively studied as a soil amendment owing to their capability to reduce the accumulation of As and Cd in plant tissues. However, a quantitative and data-based consensus has yet to be reached on the effect of AMF on As and Cd bioaccumulation and bioavailability. Here, a meta-analysis was conducted to quantitatively evaluate the impact of AMF using 1430 individual observations from 194 articles. The results showed that AMF inoculation caused a decrease in shoot and root As and Cd accumulation compared to control, and the reduction rates were affected by experimental duration, P fertilizer, AMF species, plant family, plant lifecycle, and soil properties. Intermediate experimental duration (lasting 56-112 days) and no P fertilizer favored AMF to reduce the shoot As and root Cd accumulation. Compared to other plant families, the reduction in As and Cd accumulation in legumes was the greatest, following AMF inoculation. The soils with alkaline, high organic carbon (OC), and low available phosphorus (AP) appeared to be more favorable for AMF to reduce As accumulation in plant tissues, while soils with low AP were more conducive to reducing the Cd accumulation in plant tissues. In addition, AMF inoculation increased pH (1.92%), OC (6.27%), easily-extractable glomalin-related soil protein (EE-GRSP) (29.36%), and total glomalin-related soil protein (T-GRSP) (29.99%), and reduced bioavailable As (0.52%) and Cd (2.35%) in soils compared to control. Overall, the meta-analysis provides valuable guidelines for the optimal use of AMF in different plant-soil systems.","This work was financially supported by National Key Research Development Program of China (No. 2022YFC3701303), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41625006, 41890824, 41890822, 42073012), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No. 8212036), Cross-Team and Key Laboratory Cooperative Research Special Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS “Light of West China” Program) and Scientific Research Fund project of Yunnan Provincial Department of Education (2022Y006).",,Environmental Pollution,,,Humans; Mycorrhizae; Cadmium; Bioaccumulation; Arsenic; Fertilizers; Soil Pollutants; Biological Availability; Soil; Plant Roots; Fungi,2022-11-17,2022,2022-11-17,2023-01,316,Pt 1,120619,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Tan, Qiyu; Guo, Qingjun; Wei, Rongfei; Zhu, Guangxu; Du, Chenjun; Hu, Huiying","Tan, Qiyu (School of Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Yunnan University, Kunming 650500, China.

Comparing with aquatic ecosystems, soil systems, regardless of the high importance and complexity, have been less studied under widely existing and increasing MP contamination. This review, combined with data assimilation and meta-analysis methods, has summarized current contamination conditions of soil MPs across different sites reported in earlier studies. While performing this meta-analysis, we investigated the effects of MPs on soil biota including their numbers, biomass, diversity, and physiological properties. The results showed that abundance of soil MPs ranged from 0.34 to 410958.9 items kg-1 and concentration ranged from 0.002 to 67500 mg kg-1 across sites, with agricultural soils containing significantly lower abundance and concentration of MPs than others. Presence of MPs significantly decreased the individual number of soil biota, operational taxonomic unit, diversity index (Simpson), movement index and reproduction rate, whereas the mortality rate was significantly increased by the soil MPs. Despite these significant effects, MPs did not significantly alter the biomass of soil biota, which could be due to a counteraction of their negative and positive effects on different groups of soil organisms. Moreover, we observed that soil MPs could significantly increase the Chao1 index, suggesting that MPs may act as a food resource for the soil rare biosphere. Based on the existing knowledge, we suggest that future studies should focus on research areas that include but are not limited to methodological improvements, intensive field investigations, risk assessment from the perspective of soil food web and bioaccumulation, MPs induced antibiotic resistance, and restoration strategies to reduce their concentrations in soil.",This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32071641 and U1701236) and Guangdong Science and Technology Department (2019B030301007 and 2021A1515012507).,,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,,,,2022-01-06,2022,2022-01-06,2022-01,230,,113150,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wei, Hui; Wu, Lizhu; Liu, Ziqiang; Saleem, Muhammad; Chen, Xuan; Xie, Jiefen; Zhang, Jiaen","Wei, Hui (Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Eco-circular Agriculture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China; Key Laboratory of Agro-Environment in the Tropics, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China; College of Natural Resources and Environment, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.); Wu, Lizhu (College of Natural Resources and Environment, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.); Liu, Ziqiang (College of Natural Resources and Environment, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.); Saleem, Muhammad (Department of Biological Sciences, Alabama State University, Montgomery, AL 36104, USA.); Chen, Xuan (College of Natural Resources and Environment, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.); Xie, Jiefen (Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Eco-circular Agriculture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China; Key Laboratory of Agro-Environment in the Tropics, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China; College of Natural Resources and Environment, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.); Zhang, Jiaen (Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Eco-circular Agriculture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China; Key Laboratory of Agro-Environment in the Tropics, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China; College of Natural Resources and Environment, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.

In addition, phosphorus is typically the main limiting nutrient. Thus, there have been intense efforts to counter the salinity and improve the phosphorus availability of these soils (which cover large and growing areas). A promising approach is long-term application of straw biochar, which can significantly reduce soil salinity and promote the transformation of soil phosphorus. However, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Thus, major aims of this review are to systematically address the mechanisms whereby biochar improves phosphorus bioavailability in soda saline-alkali soil through changes in the soil’s physico-chemical properties, aggregate stability, contents of organic acids, enzyme activities, key functional genes, and microbial community structure.

Here, we aim to present the state of knowledge about the effects of MNPs on soil nutrient cycling, particularly of C, N, and P. Using the latest data, the present review mainly focuses on three aspects, including (1) the effects and underlying mechanisms of MNPs on soil nutrient cycling, particularly of C, N and P, (2) the factors influencing the effects of MNPs on soil nutrient cycling, and (3) the knowledge gaps and future directions. We conclude that MNPs can alter soil nutrient cycling via mediating soil nutrient availability, soil enzyme activities, functional microbial communities, and their potential ecological functions. Furthermore, the effects of MNPs vary with MNPs characteristics (i.e., polymeric type, size, dosage, and shape), chemical additives, soil physicochemical conditions, and soil biota. Considering the complexity of MNP-soil interactions, multi-scale experiments using environmental relevant MNPs are required to shed light on the effects of MNPs on soil nutrients. By learning how MNPs influence soil nutrients cycles, this review can guide policy and management decisions to safeguard soil health and ensure sustainable agriculture and land use practices.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis on the response of soil C cycling and storage across soil profiles (organic layer, 0-5 cm, 0-10 cm, 0-20 cm, and 20-100 cm) to fire reported in 308 studies across 383 sites and examined the role of fire frequency, fire type, soil type, ecosystem type, and post-fire time in regulating the response of soil C dynamics to fire. Overall, we found soil C cycling and storage were more responsive to one fire and wildfire as compared to frequent fire and prescribed fire, respectively. Soil respiration significantly decreased by 22 ± 9% by one fire, but was not significantly affected by frequent fire across ecosystems. One fire significantly reduced soil C content in the organic, 0-10 cm, and 20-100 cm layers by 27 ± 16%, 10 ± 9%, and 33 ± 18%, respectively, while frequent fire significantly reduced soil C content at a depth of 0-5 cm and 0-20 cm by 29 ± 8% and 16 ± 12%, respectively. Soil C cycling and storage showed little response to frequent prescribed fire. In addition, the response of soil C cycling and storage varied among different soil and ecosystem types, with a stronger response being observed in forest than in grassland. Within 20 years post-fire, soil C cycling and storage tended to recover only after one fire but not after frequent fire. We also found that soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities were more responsive to one fire than frequent fire, which could indirectly affect the effects of fire on soil C cycling and storage.

A comprehensive evaluation of impacts of agricultural practices requires not only considering C storage but also direct and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and their side effects (e.g., on the water cycle or agricultural production). We used a high-resolution modeling approach with the Simulateur mulTIdisciplinaire pour les Cultures Standard soil-crop model to quantify soil organic C (SOC) storage potential, GHG balance, biomass production and nitrogen- and water-related impacts for all arable land in France for current cropping systems (baseline scenario) and three mitigation scenarios: (i) spatial and temporal expansion of cover crops, (ii) spatial insertion and temporal extension of temporary grasslands (two sub-scenarios) and (iii) improved recycling of organic resources as fertilizer. In the baseline scenario, SOC decreased slightly over 30 years in crop-only rotations but increased significantly in crop/temporary grassland rotations. Results highlighted a strong trade-off between the storage rate per unit area (kg C ha-1  year-1 ) of mitigation scenarios and the areas to which they could be applied. As a result, while the most promising scenario at the field scale was the insertion of temporary grassland (+466 kg C ha-1  year-1 stored to a depth of 0.3 m compared to the baseline, on 0.68 Mha), at the national scale, it was by far the expansion of cover crops (+131 kg C ha-1  year-1 , on 17.62 Mha). Side effects on crop production, water irrigation and nitrogen emissions varied greatly depending on the scenario and production situation. At the national scale, combining the three mitigation scenarios could mitigate GHG emissions of current cropping systems by 54% (-11.2 from the current 20.5 Mt CO2 e year-1 ), but the remaining emissions would still lie far from the objective of C-neutral agriculture.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study was supported by the French Ministry of Agriculture, Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME) and INRAE.

To fill that gap, we compiled 69 individual studies with the aim to perform two meta-analyses on nonadditive effects. We show that a significant synergistic effect (faster decomposition in mixtures than expected) occurs at a global scale, with an average increase of 3-5% in litter mixtures. In particular, low-quality litter in mixtures shows a significant synergistic effect, while additive effects are observed for high-quality species. Additionally, synergistic effects turn into antagonistic effects when soil fauna are absent or litter is in very late stages of decomposition (near-humus). In contrast to temperate and tropical areas, studies in boreal regions show significant antagonistic effects. Our two meta-analyses provide a systematic evaluation of nonadditive effects in mixed litter decomposition studies and show that litter quality alters the effects of litter mixing. Our results indicate that nutrient transfer, soil fauna and inhibitory secondary compounds can influence mixing effects. We also highlight that synergistic and antagonistic effects occur concurrently, and the final litter mixing effect results from the interplay between them.","We thank all the authors of the original studies included in our meta‐analyses.

In this study we analyzed data from 232 studies consisting of 1702 observations to investigate whether ecosystem type, climate zone, stand age, soil depth, slope, elevation, and the time since fire in influence of forest soil carbon pools to fire regime (fire type, fire season, fire intensity). Additionally, we explored the potential mechanisms of the relationships between multiple response variables to the fire using linear regression and random forest models. On aggregate, fires significantly increased the mean effect sizes of several key soil carbon cycling components-including microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total carbon (TC), pyrogenic carbon (PyC), soil organic matter (SOM), soil organic carbon (SOC) by 0.77, 0.89, 0.87, 1.22, 0.97 and 0.93, respectively, compared to unburned forests ecosystems. However, the fire effects on soil C pools vary widely between environmental factors and duration, and are mediated by factors such as tree species, fire type, and soil layer. A correlation analysis displayed the effects of fire on MBC and DOC were significantly and negatively correlated with elevation. Fire effects on the forest floor and mineral soil indicated significantly increased PyC. SOC and TC in coniferous tree species are the most sensitive to fires, thereby altering important feedback relationships with the fire-vegetatale-climate system. Interestingly, latitude has a stronger influence on SOC than mean annual precipitation or elevation, indicating that variations in latitude play a significant role in regulating the amount of SOC in forest ecosystems. Overall, the results illustrated geographic variation in fire effects on soil C cycling underscores the need for region-specific fire management plans, and help us understand the responses of soil C cycling to fire in forest ecosystems, and facilitate decision-making to forest fire management.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no competing interests.

In this study, we assessed how the effects of nitrogen (N) fertiliser on specific root respiration (SRR) varied among mycorrhizal type (Myco type). We conducted a multi-level meta-analysis across 1,600 observations from 32 publications. SRR increased in ectomycorrhizal (ECM) plants with more than 100 kg N ha-1 applied, did not change in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants, but increased in plants with a dual mycorrhizal association in response to N fertilisation. Our results suggest that high N availability (>100 kg N ha-1) could disadvantage the growth of ECM plants because of increased C costs associated with maintaining higher root N concentrations, while the insensitivity in SRR by AM plants to N fertilisation may be because AM fungi are more important for phosphorus (P) uptake.",,Funding.

Recently, whether a tree species forms a symbiosis with arbuscular (AM) versus ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi has been suggested as a strong predictor of soil C storage, but there is wide variability within EcM systems. In this study, we investigated how mycorrhizal associations and the species composition of canopy trees and mycorrhizal fungi related to the proportion of soil C and nitrogen (N) in mineral associations and soil C:N across four sites representing distinct climates and tree communities in the eastern US broadleaf forest biome. In two of our sites, we found the expected relationship of declining mineral-associated C and N and increasing soil C:N ratios as the basal area of EcM-associating trees increased. However, across all sites these soil properties strongly correlated with canopy tree and fungal species composition. Sites where the expected pattern with EcM basal area was observed were (1) dominated by trees with lower quality litter in the Pinaceae and Fagaceae families and (2) dominated by EcM fungi with medium-distance exploration type hyphae, melanized tissues, and the potential to produce peroxidases. This observational study demonstrates that differences in SOM between AM and EcM systems are dependent on the taxa of trees and EcM fungi involved. Important information is lost when the rich mycorrhizal symbiosis is reduced to two categories.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank Cassandra Allsup for field assistance and Fernando Montaño Lopez for assistance with obtaining N deposition estimates.

To do so, we carried out a split-plot experiment (SW France) crossing four different intensities of biomass harvesting (Stem-Only Harvest [SOH], Aboveground Additional Harvest [AAH], Belowground Additional Harvest [BAH], and Whole-Tree Harvest [WTH]) and three compensation methods (control [C], wood ash application [A] and phosphorus fertilisation [P]). The experimental treatments were followed by the plantation of pines (Pinus pinaster). The environmental consequences of treatments on soil and vegetation were evaluated 11 years after the tree plantation. Despite their low additional biomass exports (+10 % for AAH to +34 % for WTH), the non-conventional harvest practices exported much higher quantities of nutrients than the conventional SOH technique (+145 % of exported N in WTH). Additional biomass harvests impacted the soil organic matter content, with negative effects on P-organic, soil cation exchange capacity, exchangeable Ca, and most extractible nutrients. However, tree nutritional status was improved by P-fertiliser or wood ash. We observed a positive effect of wood ash application on soil pH and nutrient content but, like additional harvests, wood ash application decreased the pool of soil organic carbon (~10 %). Overall, the experiment showed that exporting more forest biomass due to the additional harvesting of biomass had negative consequences on the ecosystem biogeochemistry. Additional harvests have impoverished the soil, and decreased the soil organic carbon content. Importantly, applying nutrients as fertiliser or wood ash did not compensate for all the negative impacts of biomass exports and the method of wood ash recycling in forests could even decrease the soil organic carbon.","We thank the ISPA lab for providing the F.B.

Both no-tillage (NT) and NT plus residue retention (NTS) increased soil microbial count as compared with conventional tillage (CT). Bacteria, fungi, and actinomycete counts were 3%, 18%, and 28%, respectively, higher under the NTS treatment relative to the NT treatment, and 38%, 41%, and 28%, respectively, higher in the CT plus residue retention (CTS) treatment than in the CT treatment. No-tillage, as compared to CT, increased total PLFAs by 11%. The concentration of fungal PLFAs was increased by 17% by NT as compared to CT, but was decreased by 52% by NTS as compared to NT. The actinomycete PLFA concentration was decreased by reduced tillage and CTS, compared to CT. Compared with CT, NT increased the Shannon index of the total microbial and bacterial communities by 4% and 6%, respectively. The bacterial count was negatively associated with mean annual precipitation (275-1624 mm) and experimental duration (1-35 years) and positively associated with initial total soil nitrogen concentration. Overall, relative to CT, minimum tillage alone increased soil microbial count, fungal biomass, and bacterial diversity; residue retention alone increased soil microbial count and fungal diversity, and decreased the biomass of actinomycetes; combining minimum tillage and residue retention increased soil microbial count and fungal diversity. We conclude that the response to minimum tillage and residue retention was consistently positive for soil microbial count but was context dependent for microbial biomass, diversity, and community structure.","We thank all the researchers whose data were used in this meta-analysis.

Among the various techniques, adsorptive removal of arsenic is considered as a viable most effective method. However, limited attention is given to understand the overall relative sorption capacity of different sorbents (e.g., biocomposite, biochar and nano-composite etc.) since various factors influence the sorption capacity. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of various adsorbents with quantitative estimation (Langmuir adsorption maxima, Qmax) as well as to evaluate the influence of experimental conditions on the achievement of maximum adsorption. A number of analyses including meta-analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), scientometric and regression were performed. The results revealed that among the sorbents, nanoparticles show the greatest sorption capacity while pre-doped biochar performed the best among different biochars. Average across all sorbents, As (V) removal efficacy was higher than As (III). As expected, a high point of zero charge (PZC) and higher positive surface charge favored adsorption. The relative contribution of different mechanisms was also discussed. Our scientometric analyses revealed that, research should focus on the development of low-cost adsorbents and increase their reusability, safe disposal of adsorbed arsenic. Altogether, our findings provide a molecular understanding of arsenic sorption to different sorbents with implications for tailoring a good sorbent for arsenic removal from drinking water.",We did not receive any significant contribution from others to acknowledge.,,The Science of The Total Environment,,,"Arsenic; Drinking Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Charcoal; Adsorption; Water Purification; Kinetics",2022-12-09,2022,2022-12-09,2023-03,862,,160821,Closed,Article,"Aktar, Sanjida; Mia, Shamim; Makino, Tomoyuki; Rahman, Mohammad Mahmudur; Rajapaksha, Anushka Upamali","Aktar, Sanjida (Department of Environmental Science, Patuakhali Science and Technology University, Patuakhali 8602, Bangladesh.); Mia, Shamim (Department of Agronomy, Patuakhali Science and Technology University, Patuakhali 8602, Bangladesh.

It has received significant achievement by reducing the fire spots remarkably, but fire spots still cannot be eliminated in farmland. Although considerable papers and reviews on straw burning have been conducted, there is still a lack of comprehensive and systematic review of exploring the status, obstacles, implications, and motivations of this phenomenon, especially revealing the unique circumstance and experience in China. The review first summarizes the reasons as well as hazards of straw burning in China, and then explores the dilemma of straw burning ban in terms of farmers' endowments. And then, the review discusses the limitations of subsidy from financial expenditure and suggests two alternative innovative incentives: transferred payment from stakeholders and carbon trading. It is hoped that policy suggestion about straw burning and innovative incentives can enlighten researchers and policymakers who intend to implement straw burning ban effectively in the future.","This research was funded by Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China (No.18ZDA048), the earmarked fund for Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System-Green Manure (CARS-22-G25), Fundamental Research Funds for Central Non-profit Scientific Institution (No.1610132021002).

In 2020, the total amount of N in organic amendments applied to Japanese agricultural soils (440 ktN) was larger than that of synthetic fertilizer (374 ktN). However, N2O emissions from organic amendments were estimated by using the country-specific N2O emission factor (EF) for synthetic fertilizer (0.31 % for rice paddy, 2.9 % for tea, and 0.62 % for other crops) in the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report of Japan. Thus, we conducted a N2O flux measurement campaign at 12 different experimental sites across Japan to estimate fertilizer-induced N2O EFs for major organic amendments in Japan, that is, poultry manure compost, swine manure compost, cattle manure compost, and organic fertilizer pellets. In addition, we conducted systematic review of N2O emissions and EFs for organic amendments, including data from our measurement campaign and published data from peer-reviewed papers in Japan. The final dataset, including the field measurement campaign and published data, resulted in 404 observations (including synthetic fertilizer and zero-N control) in 29 sites. Results showed that soil type affected EFs, that is, the mean EF of Andosols was lower than that of non-Andosols, which is similar to the case of EFs for synthetic fertilizer. Mean EFs for poultry manure compost, swine manure compost, cattle manure (compost and slurry), and non-animal manure organic fertilizers were 0.83 % (uncertainty range of 2.5th and 97.5th percentile: 0.09 % to 3.46 %), 0.70 % (0.02 % to 2.45 %), 0.39 % (0.00 % to 1.62 %), and 1.16 % (0.41 % to 3.03 %), respectively, when weighted by area of soil types. The mean EF of all organic amendments was 0.84 % (0.00 % to 2.91 %), when the area of soil type and amount of organic amendment used in Japan were considered.

Soil microbial community (SMC) play a major role in C cycling and their activity has been considered as the main driver of differences in the potential to store C in soils. The composition of the SMC is crucial for the maintenance of soil ecosystem services, as the structure and activity of SMC also regulates the turnover and delivery of nutrients, as well as the rate of decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). Quantifying the impact of agricultural practices on both SMC and SCS is key to improve sustainability of soil management. Hence, we discuss the impact of farming practices improving SCS by altering SMC, SOM, and soil aggregates, unraveling their inter-and intra-relationships. Using quantitative and process driven insights from 197 peer-reviewed publications leads to the conclusion that the net benefits from agricultural management to improve SCS would not be sustainable if we overlook the role of soil microbial community. Reintroduction of the decayed microbial community to agricultural soils is crucial for enhancing long-term C storage potential of soils and stabilize them over time. The interactions among SMC, SOM, soil aggregates, and agricultural activities still require more knowledge and research to understand their full contribution to the SCS.","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT) Mexico is thankfully acknowledged for partially supporting this work under Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (SNI) program awarded to Hafiz M.N.

However, the health effects of PM2.5 components have been less studied. There is a pressing need to better understand the relative contribution of components of PM2.5, which can lay the scientific basis for designing effective policies and targeted interventions.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study, comprising all Medicare enrollees aged 65 or older in the southeastern United States from 2000 to 2016, to explore the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 major components and all-cause mortality among the elderly. Based on well-validated prediction models, we estimated ZIP code-level annual mean concentrations for five major PM2.5 components, including black carbon (BC), nitrate (NIT), organic matter (OM), sulfate (SO4), and soil particles. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: The cohort comprised 13,590,387 Medicare enrollees and a total of 107,191,652 person-years. In single-component models, all five major PM2.5 components were significantly associated with elevated all-cause mortality. The hazard ratios (HR) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure were 1.027 (95% CI: 1.025-1.030), 1.012 (95% CI: 1.010-1.013), 1.018 (95% CI: 1.017-1.020), 1.021 (95% CI: 1.017-1.024), and 1.004 (95% CI: 1.003-1.006) for BC, NIT, OM, SO4, and soil particles, respectively. While the effect estimate of soil component was statistically significant, it is much smaller than those of combustion-related components.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides epidemiological evidence that long-term exposure to major PM2.5 components is significantly associated with elevated mortality.","This study was supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS R21 ES032606), the National Institute on Aging (NIA/NIH R01 AG074357), and the HERCULES Center (P30 ES019776).

However, the global distribution of the N effects on Rs remains uncertain. Here, we compiled a new database containing 1282 observations of Rs and its heterotrophic component (Rh) in field N manipulative experiments from 317 published papers. Using this up-to-date database, we first performed a formal meta-analysis to explore the responses of Rs and Rh to N addition, and then presented a global spatially explicit quantification of the N effects using a Random Forest model. Our results showed that experimental N addition significantly increased Rs but had a minimal impact on Rh, not supporting the prevailing view that N enrichment inhibits soil microbial respiration. For the major biomes, the magnitude of N input was the main determinant of the spatial variation in Rs response, while the most important predictors for Rh response were biome specific. Based on the key predictors, global mapping visually demonstrated a positive N effect in the regions with higher anthropogenic N inputs (i.e., atmospheric N deposition and agricultural fertilization). Overall, our analysis not only provides novel insight into the N effects on soil CO2 fluxes, but also presents a spatially explicit assessment of the N effects at the global scale, which are pivotal for understanding ecosystem carbon dynamics in future scenarios with more frequent anthropogenic activities.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the editor and three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that have greatly improved our manuscript.

5869,pub.1145078294,10.1111/gcb.16107,35092113,,Changes in plant inputs alter soil carbon and microbial communities in forest ecosystems,"Global changes can alter plant inputs from both above- and belowground, which, thus, may differently affect soil carbon and microbial communities. However, the general patterns of how plant input changes affect them in forests remain unclear. By conducting a meta-analysis of 3193 observations from 166 experiments worldwide, we found that alterations in aboveground litter and/or root inputs had profound effects on soil carbon and microbial communities in forest ecosystems. Litter addition stimulated soil organic carbon (SOC) pools and microbial biomass, whereas removal of litter, roots or both (no inputs) decreased them. The increased SOC under litter addition suggested that aboveground litter inputs benefit SOC sequestration despite accelerated decomposition. Unlike root removal, litter alterations and no inputs altered particulate organic carbon, whereas all detrital treatments did not significantly change mineral-associated organic carbon. In addition, detrital treatments contrastingly altered soil microbial community, with litter addition or removal shifting it toward fungi, whereas root removal shifting it toward bacteria. Furthermore, the responses of soil carbon and microbial biomass to litter alterations positively correlated with litter input rate and total litter input, suggesting that litter input quantity is a critical controller of belowground processes. Taken together, these findings provide critical insights into understanding how altered plant productivity and allocation affects soil carbon cycling, microbial communities and functioning of forest ecosystems under global changes. Future studies can take full advantage of the existing plant detritus experiments and should focus on the relative roles of litter and roots in forming SOC and its fractions.","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42141006 and 31988102).

Organic material addition plays a crucial role in soil improvement and remediation, soil carbon sequestration, and improving soil fertilizer and productivity. In order to explore the comprehensive impact of organic material addition on properties of saline soil (including the physical and chemical properties, nutrient fixation, crop yield, and carbon sink capacity), we conducted a global meta-analysis using data from 141 articles. We found that, soil salinization significantly reduced plant biomass (50.1 %), soil organic carbon (20.6 %), and microbial biomass carbon (36.5 %). Meanwhile, it also reduced CO2 flux (25.8 %) and CH4 flux (90.2 %) significantly. Adding organic materials to saline soil significantly increased crop yield (30.4 %), plant biomass (30.1 %), soil organic carbon (62.2 %), and microbial biomass carbon (78.2 %), but also increased CO2 flux (221.9 %) and CH4 flux (29.7 %). Considering the balance of both carbon sequestration and carbon emissions, organic material addition significantly increased the net carbon sequestration by about 5890.7 kg CO2-eq·hm-2·100 d-1 on average. Besides, the organic material addition reduced soil salinity, exchangeable sodium, and pH, and increased >0.25 mm aggregates and soil fertility. Our findings suggest that organic material addition can improve both carbon sequestration in saline soil and crop yield. Considering the huge area of saline soil around the world, this understanding is essential to reduce the saline obstacle, improve the soil carbon sink capacity, ensure food security, and increase farmland reserves.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Cells were Gram-negative, motile rods, oxidase- and catalase-positive. Strain CSV86T possess a 6.79 Mb genome with 62.72 G + C mol%. 16S rRNA gene phylogeny relates strain CSV86T to the genus Pseudomonas, with highest similarity to Pseudomonas japonica WLT (99.38%). Multi-locus sequence analyses of gyrB-rpoB-rpoD-recA and 33 ribosomal proteins (rps) displayed overall low similarities to its phylogenetic relatives with poor similarity score (6%). Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and in-silico DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) showed poor (87.11% and 33.2%, respectively) genomic relatedness of strain CSV86T to its closest relatives, indicating genomic distinctiveness. The major cellular fatty acids were 16:0, 17:0cyclo, summed-feature-3 (16:1ω7c/16:1ω6c) and -8 (18:1ω7c). Further, differential abundance of 12:0, 10:0 3-OH and 12:0 3-OH and phenotypic differences distinguished strain CSV86T from closest relatives, hence designated as Pseudomonas bharatica. The unique aromatic degradation ability, resistance to heavy metals, efficient nitrogen-sulfur assimilation, beneficial eco-physiological traits (production of indole acetic acid, siderophore and fusaric acid efflux) and plasmid-free genome suggest strain CSV86T to be a model organism for bioremediation and ideal host for metabolic engineering.","BM thanks Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay for providing Institute Post-Doctoral Fellowship and PSP thanks DST, DBT and BRNS for research funding.","BM thanks Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay for providing Institute Post-Doctoral Fellowship and PSP thanks DST, DBT and BRNS for research funding.",Journal of Environmental Science and Health Part A,,,"Phospholipids; Genes, Bacterial; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil; Base Composition; India; Fatty Acids; Pseudomonas; DNA; DNA, Bacterial; Soil Microbiology",2023-05-03,2023,2023-05-03,2023-06-07,58,7,633-646,Closed,Article,"Mohapatra, Balaram; Phale, Prashant S.","Mohapatra, Balaram (Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, Powai, Mumbai, India); Phale, Prashant S.

The functions of grassland ecosystems depend on a mutual relationship between aboveground and belowground biota. While the effects of increasing stocking density on plant biomass are well studied, little is known about its impact on soil microbial properties. To fill this knowledge gap a grazing experiment was conducted on a summer pasture in the Chinese Altai Mountains during the summers of 2014 and 2015 using a randomized block design with stocking densities of 0, 8, 16, and 24 sheep ha−1 replicated four times. After two summer grazing periods (each 56 days), topsoil samples (1–7 cm) were taken in September 2015 and analyzed for major physical, chemical, and microbial soil properties. Except for the metabolic quotient (qCO2; p < 0.05), the examined soil properties remained unaffected by the increasing stocking densities, likely due to high spatial variability. The qCO2 declined from 13.5 mg CO2–C g−1 microbial biomass C d−1 at zero grazing to 12.2 mg CO2–C g−1 microbial biomass C d−1 at a stocking density of 24 sheep ha−1. Low values of qCO2 indicate an aged and dormant microbial community that diverts less soil organic carbon (SOC) to catabolic processes within their cells, characteristic for C limiting conditions. The aboveground biomass affected by grazing intensity correlated positively with SOC (rs = 0.60, p = 0.015) and ergosterol (rs = 0.76, p = 0.001) pointing indirectly to the effect of stocking density. Additionally to the relatively high values of qCO2, highest values of SOC (39.2 mg g−1 soil), ergosterol (6.01 µg g−1 soil), and basal respiration (10.7 µg g−1 soil d−1) were observed at a stocking density of 8 sheep ha−1 indicating that a low grazing intensity is recommendable to avoid soil degradation.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the excellent laboratory assistance of Benjamin Tarek Kahl, Sabine Ahlers, Anja Sawallisch, Elsa Zwicker, and especially Gabriele Dormann and her team.

Although some studies have reported the effects of NTS on soil aggregate stability and soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, the underlying mechanisms of how soil aggregates, aggregate-associated SOC and total nitrogen (TN) respond to no-tillage remain unclear. Through a global meta-analysis of 91 studies in cropland ecosystems, we evaluated the effects of no-tillage on soil aggregates and their associated SOC and TN concentrations. On average, no-tillage treatment significantly decreased the proportions of microaggregates (MA) by 21.4 % (95 % CI, -25.5 to -17.3 %) and silt+clay size particles (SIC) by 24.1 (95 % CI, -30.9 to -17.0 %), and increased the proportions of large macroaggregate (LA) by 49.5 % (95 % CI, 36.7-63.0 %) and small macroaggregate (SA) by 6.1 % (95 % CI, 2.0-10.9 %) compared to those in conventional tillage. The SOC concentrations for all three aggregate sizes increased significantly with no tillage: for LA by 28.2 % (95 % CI, 18.8-39.5 %), SA by 18.0 % (95 % CI, 12.8-23.3 %), and MA by 9.1 % (95 % CI, 2.6-16.8 %). TN also increased significantly for all sizes with no tillage, with LA by 13.6 % (95 % CI, 8.6-17.6 %), SA by 11.0 % (95 % CI, 5.0-17.0 %), MA by 11.7 % (95 % CI, 7.0-16.4 %), and SIC by 7.6 % (95 % CI, 2.4-13.8 %). The magnitude of the no-tillage treatment effect on soil aggregation, aggregate-associated SOC and TN varied with the environmental and experimental conditions. The positive effect on the proportions of LA occurred with initial soil organic matter (SOM) content >10 g kg-1, whereas SOM <10 g kg-1 did not change significantly. Additionally, the effect size of NTS compared with CTS was lower than that of NT compared with CT. These findings suggest that NTS may promote physically protective SOC accumulation through the formation of macroaggregates by reducing disturbance destruction and increasing plant-derived binding agents. The findings highlight that no-tillage may enhance the formation of soil aggregates and the associated SOC and TN concentrations in global cropland ecosystems.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work.

Four sites across Europe (in Germany, Romania, Spain, and Sweden) were investigated as case studies for country-specific reductions in tillage intensity. Conventional tillage (CT) by mouldboard ploughing was compared with shallow and deep non-inversion minimum tillage (MT) and/or no-tillage (NT). In Sweden, NT and MT had positive effects on the concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) in the upper 20 cm compared with CT. At the German site, MT increased SOC, N, and MBC concentrations in the top 10 cm. In contrast, CT increased MBC contents and bulk density between 20 and 30 cm soil depth. At the Romanian site, soil parameters showed no differences between inverse tillage (CT) and non-inverse tillage (MT), both with a working depth of 25 to 30 cm. At the Spanish site, the use of NT significantly increased the concentrations as well as the stocks of C, N, and MBC compared to CT. In conclusion, reduced tillage improved soil microbial properties in most cases. However, the effectiveness of reduced tillage appears to be highly dependent on site conditions such as pH, soil texture, and climatic conditions.","We would like to thank Karin Schmidt for technical assistance as well as Janine Kaus and Jan-Christoph Rattay for help with the experiment.

However, no systematic review is available on DOM indicators of BDOC and CO2 production potential. Optical and molecular indices can be used to track small changes in DOM composition during biodegradation. In this review, we identified four different methods for measuring BDOC together with their strengths and limitations. In addition, we discuss the potential of using documented optical indices based on absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular indices based on Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry as proxies for estimating BDOC and biodegradation-induced CO2 production based on previously reported relationships in the literature. Many absorbance- and fluorescence-based indices showed inconsistent relationships with BDOC depending on watershed characteristics, hydrology, and anthropogenic impacts. Nevertheless, several indices, including specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254), humification index (HIX), and terrestrial humic-like fluorescent DOM (FDOM) components, tended to have negative relationships with BDOC in tropical and temperate watersheds under baseflow or drought periods. Protein-like FDOM exhibited the strongest correlation with BDOC in different systems, except during storms and flood events. Despite the limited number of studies, DOM molecular indices exhibited consistent relationships with BDOC, suggesting that the relative abundance of aliphatic formulas and the molecular lability index could act as reliable proxies. The DOM optical indices explain up to 96% and 78% variability in BDOC and CO2, respectively; nonetheless, there were limited studies on molecular indices, which explain up to 74% variability in BDOC.

Integrated strategies that improve soil, crop and nutrient management are needed to ensure more sustainable production systems. We conducted a two-year field experiment to evaluate the potential of integrated soil-crop system management (ISSM) practices to improve the productivity and environmental outcomes from an intensive greenhouse tomato production system in the Yangtze River Basin, China. Four treatments were tested: i) farmers' practice (FP); ii) soil remediation (SR), where lime nitrogen with compost addition was the only management strategy; iii) a treatment that combined soil remediation with optimized crop planting density (SRCO), which increased planting density for improving crop yield; and iv) integrated soil-crop system management (ISSM), as a systematic integrated approach, which included the combined optimization of soil remediation, crop optimization, and nutrient management. In the integrated soil-crop system management treatment, nutrient management was optimized through adoption of the most appropriate type (formula) of fertilizer for the crop, rate and application timing of synthetic fertilizer, and by substituting poultry manure with compost. Our results indicated that the fruit yield of the integrated soil-crop system management treatment was 104 t ha-1, 13.4%-37.3% higher than that of the other three treatments. The mean reactive nitrogen loss (81.1 kg N ha-1) and the greenhouse gas emissions (6495 kg CO2-eq ha-1) in the farmers' practice treatment were much higher than in the other three treatments (reactive nitrogen loss: 47.9-54.3 kg N ha-1; and greenhouse gas emissions: 4926-5468 kg CO2-eq ha-1, respectively). The mean nitrogen and carbon footprints of the integrated soil-crop system management treatment were significantly lower than those of other treatments, as a result of both the lower fertilizer nitrogen use and the greater yield. This study indicates that integrated soil-crop system management could produce greater yields and increase net profit with reduced nitrogen inputs, whilst reducing the environmental cost associated with conventional farmers' practice in plastic-greenhouse vegetable production systems.","This research was financially supported by National Key RD Program of China (No. 2017YFD0800403); Changjiang Scholarship, Ministry of Education, China; CAU-SIERTE cooperation project; and State Cultivation Base of Eco-agriculture for Southwest Mountainous Land, Southwest University.",,Journal of Environmental Management,,,Agriculture; China; Fertilizers; Lycopersicon esculentum; Nitrogen; Soil,2020-04-16,2020,2020-04-16,2020-07,266,,110569,Closed,Article,"Wang, Xiaozhong; Zhao, Mingjiong; Liu, Bin; Zou, Chunqin; Sun, Yixiang; Wu, Gang; Zhang, Qian; Jin, Guoqing; Jin, Zhenghui; Chadwick, Dave; Chen, Xinping","Wang, Xiaozhong (College of Resources and Environment, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, China; Interdisciplinary Research Center for Agriculture Green Development in Yangtze River Basin, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, China); Zhao, Mingjiong (College of Resources and Environme nt, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China); Liu, Bin (College of Resources and Environment, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400716, China; College of Resources and Environme nt, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China); Zou, Chunqin (College of Resources and Environme nt, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China); Sun, Yixiang (Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute, Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hefei, 230031, China); Wu, Gang (Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute, Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hefei, 230031, China); Zhang, Qian (Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute, Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hefei, 230031, China); Jin, Guoqing (Anhui Sierte Fertilizer Industry Co., Ltd.

More frequent extreme climate conditions (high temperatures coupled with severe drought periods) have become a matter of concern for the wine sector of typically dry and warm regions, such as the Mediterranean European countries. Soil is a natural resource crucial to sustaining the equilibrium of ecosystems, economic growth and people's prosperity worldwide. In viticulture, soils have a great influence on crop performance (growth, yield and berry composition) and wine quality, as the soil is a central component of the terroir. Soil temperature (ST) affects multiple physical, chemical and biological processes occurring in the soil as well as in plants growing on it. Moreover, the impact of ST is stronger in row crops such as grapevine, since it favors soil exposition to radiation and favors evapotranspiration. The role of ST on crop performance remains poorly described, especially under more extreme climatic conditions. Therefore, a better understanding of the impact of ST in vineyards (vine plants, weeds, microbiota) can help to better manage and predict vineyards' performance, plant-soil relations and soil microbiome under more extreme climate conditions. In addition, soil and plant thermal data can be integrated into Decision Support Systems (DSS) to support vineyard management. In this paper, the role of ST in Mediterranean vineyards is reviewed namely in terms of its effect on vines' ecophysiological and agronomical performance and its relation with soil properties and soil management strategies. The potential use of imaging approaches, e.g. thermography, is discussed as an alternative or complementary tool to assess ST and vertical canopy temperature profiles/gradients in vineyards. Soil management strategies to mitigate the negative impact of climate change, optimize ST variation and crop thermal microclimate (leaf and berry) are proposed and discussed, with emphasis on Mediterranean systems.",,"JMC and AN were funded by national funds through FCT – Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, I.P., under the project UIDB/04129/2020 of LEAF-Linking Landscape, Environment, Agriculture and Food, Research Unit.

Climate change, however, is increasingly threatening the resilience of vineyard landscapes and of their ecological conditions, undermining the provision of multiple ecosystem services. Previous research has often focused on climate change impacts, ecosystem conditions and ecosystem services without systematically reviewing how they have been studied in the literature on viticulture. Here, we systematically review the literature on vineyard landscapes to identify how ecosystem conditions and services have been investigated, and whether an integrative approach to investigate the effects of climate change was adopted. Our results indicate that there are still very few studies that explicitly address multiple ecosystem conditions and services together. Only 28 and 18% of the reviewed studies considered more than two ecosystem conditions or services, respectively. Moreover, while more than 97% of the relationships between ecosystem conditions and services studied were addressing provisioning and regulating services, only 3% examined cultural services. Finally, this review found that there is a lack of integrative studies that address simultaneously the relationships between ecosystem condition, ecosystem services and climate change (only 15 out of 112 studies). To overcome these gaps and to better understand the functioning of vineyard socio-ecological systems under climate change, multidisciplinary, integrative, and comprehensive approaches should be adopted by future studies. A holistic understanding of vineyard landscapes will indeed be crucial to support researchers and decision makers in developing sustainable adaptation strategies that enhance the ecological condition of vineyards and ensure the provision of multiple ecosystem services under future climate scenarios.","The authors would like to thank Matteo Dainese for his valuable comments on a draft of this manuscript and Rachele Carloni for formatting figures and tables.The authors thank the Department of Innovation, Research and University of the Autonomous Province of Bozen/Bolzano for covering the Open Access publication costs.","This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund through the Interreg Alpine Space Program (‘AlpES | Alpine Ecosystem Services – mapping, maintenance, management’, project number ASP 183; ‘LUIGI | Linking Urban and Inner-alpine Green Infrastructure’, project number ASP 863); and the Interreg V-A ITA-AUT program (REBECKA, project number ITAT1002).

Food Production and Crop Yields of Urban Agriculture: A Meta‐Analysis,"Urban agriculture can contribute to food security, food system resilience and sustainability at the city level. While studies have examined urban agricultural productivity, we lack systemic knowledge of how agricultural productivity of urban systems compares to conventional agriculture and how productivity varies for different urban spaces (e.g., allotments vs. rooftops vs. indoor farming) and growing systems (e.g., hydroponics vs. soil-based agriculture). Here, we present a global meta-analysis that seeks to quantify crop yields of urban agriculture for a broad range of crops and explore differences in yields for distinct urban spaces and growing systems. We found 200 studies reporting urban crop yields, from which 2,062 observations were extracted. Lettuces and chicories were the most studied urban grown crops. We observed high agronomic suitability of urban areas, with urban agricultural yields on par with or greater than global average conventional agricultural yields. ""Cucumbers and gherkins"" was the category of crops for which differences in yields between urban and conventional agriculture were the greatest (17 kg m-2 cycle-1 vs. 3.8 kg m-2 cycle-1). Some urban spaces and growing systems also had a significant effect on specific crop yields (e.g., tomato yields in hydroponic systems were significantly greater than tomato yields in soil-based systems). This analysis provides a more robust, globally relevant evidence base on the productivity of urban agriculture that can be used in future research and practice relating to urban agriculture, especially in scaling-up studies aiming to estimate the self-sufficiency of cities and towns and their potential to meet local food demand.","This work was funded by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) as part of the “Rurban Revolution: Can ruralising urban areas through greening and growing create a healthy, sustainable &amp; resilient food system?” project (Grant No. BB/S01425X/1).

However, these two issues have been primarily investigated separately hitherto, although they exhibit a cause-and-effect relationship. Studies considering MPs and climate change as causal entities have focused only on MP pollution in marine environments as a contributor to climate change. Meanwhile, systematic causal studies have not been performed inadequately to understand the role of soil, which is a primary terrestrial sink of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the context of MP pollution, in climate change. In this study, the causal effect of soil MP pollution on GHG emissions as direct and indirect contributors to climate change is systematically analyzed. The mechanisms underlying the contribution of soil MPs to climate change are discussed, and future research perspectives are suggested. Approximately 121 research manuscripts pertaining to MP pollution and its associated effects on GHGs, carbon sinks, and soil respiration, recorded between 2018 and 2023, are selected and cataloged from seven database categories in PubMed, Google Scholar, Nature's database, and Web of Science. Several studies demonstrated that soil MP pollution directly contributes to climate change by accelerating the emission of GHGs from the soil to the atmosphere and indirectly by promoting soil respiration and adversely affecting natural carbon sinks, such as trees. Other studies correlated the release of GHGs from the soil to mechanisms such as the alteration of soil aeration, methanogen activity, and carbon and nitrogen cycles, and improved the abundance of carbon and nitrogen soil microbial functional genes adhering to plant roots to create anoxic conditions for plant growth. In general, soil MP pollution increases the release of GHGs into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to climate change. However, further research is to be conducted by investigating the underlying mechanisms using more practical field-scale data.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We conducted a meta-analysis of 453 paired observations from 68 peer-reviewed journal articles to assess the response of vegetable yields in greenhouse vegetable systems in China to organic fertilization. Compared with the control (no organic fertilizer), organic fertilization significantly increased the yields of vegetables by 44.11% on average. The response of vegetable yields to organic fertilizer tended to increase with the increasing experimental duration. Organic fertilizer application had the greatest potential for leafy vegetables (+76.44%), in loamy soils (+53.94%), at moderate organic fertilizer carbon input levels (+54.13%), and in soils with moderate initial soil total nitrogen levels (+50.89%). Aggregated boosted tree analysis indicated that organic fertilizer carbon inputs, vegetable type and experimental duration were the predominant factors that manipulated the response of vegetable yields to organic fertilizer application. The rational application of farmyard manure would be a promising strategy for increasing vegetable yields in greenhouse vegetable systems in China.

Numerous studies have examined SOC and TN dynamics in different cropping systems. However, there is some uncertainty regarding the relative impacts of some CA practices, and it is not always clear how other agricultural management, particularly nitrogen addition, interacts with these practices to influence SOC and TN sequestration. Thus, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 752 comparisons from 97 papers to analyze the impacts of nitrogen fertilizers and CA practices (namely crop diversification, minimal soil disturbance (no-tillage) and permanent soil cover), on SOC and TN content worldwide. Overall, our study showed the most significant increase of SOC [21.39 % (CI = 15.16 to 28.64)] and TN [54.34 % (CI = 26.19 to 96.69)] stock with CA practices compared to conventional practices in the 0-15 cm soil depth. It also showed a significant increase in SOC and TN stock with all the individual components of CA compared to conventional practices in the 0-15 cm soil depth. However, the impact of CA on SOC and TN is reduced in 0-60 cm depths compared to surface soil depths due to the limited input of crop residue deeper in the soil profile. Manure and manure mixed with mineral-N led to greater SOC sequestration [20.67 % (CI = 15.23 to 27.10) and 41.67 % (CI = 31.03 to 52.79), respectively] than mineral-N alone [9.08 % (CI = 6.44 to 11.83)]. Cropping systems that included legume residue decreased the C/N ratio. This highlights that adequate mineral-N fertilizer addition may also be required in conjunction with residue retention practices to improve SOC and TN content. Overall, these results show that CA systems that include legume residue and manure mixed with mineral-N have great potential to increase SOC and TN, particularly at 0-15 cm and 0-30 cm soil depth.",We thank the scientists who contributed to this work.

Furthermore, the application of biochar to the soil can alter the dynamics of the roots and, in turn, affect the performance of the plant. Nevertheless, the long-term evolution of these effects is unknown and of critical importance because biochar persists in soil for centuries. The results of this work are part of a long-term study in the vineyard started in 2009 and still ongoing. In this work, the effect of applying biochar to soil on the plant-water relationships of Vitis vinifera, soil properties and fine root traits is evaluated 10 years after application. Even after 10 years, the ecophysiological measurements indicated an increase in soil water content and a significant increase in the water status of the plants in the plots treated with biochar. Independently of the diameter class considered, both doses of biochar led in the entire 40 cm of soil to a general reduction of the fine-root standing biomass and length, which is probably due to the lower need for fine root foraging. Moreover, the SRL did not show differences among different treatments. When fine-root traits were analysed along the soil depth at 10 cm intervals, we noted that both length and biomass were significantly higher in the control plant only in the upper soil layers (20 cm) and SRL was significantly higher only in the upper 10 cm of soil. These findings underscore how control plants plastically respond to the lower content of water in the soil by decreasing the fine-root cost-to-benefit ratio, especially in the topsoil layer. Research on the effect of biochar in viticulture can provide an effective contribution to the mitigation of climate change by increasing the water status of the soil and plants even 10 years after its application.","The authors acknowledge the staff of “Marchesi Antinori - La Braccesca Estate” for their technical support and for hosting the experiment and in particular Francesco Sabatini, (IBE-CNR), and Francesca Sophie Fall (Italian Biochar Association-ICHAR) are acknowledged for their valuable technical assistance during the field experiments and during ecophysiological measurements.

The opportunity may be too good to be missed! Yet the tremendous complexity of the two issues at stake calls for a detailed and nuanced examination of any potential solution, no matter how appealing. Here, we critically re-examine the benefits of global SOC sequestration strategies on both climate change mitigation and food production. While estimated contributions of SOC sequestration to climate change vary, almost none take SOC saturation into account. Here, we show that including saturation in estimations decreases any potential contribution of SOC sequestration to climate change mitigation by 53%-81% towards 2100. In addition, reviewing more than 21 meta-analyses, we found that observed yield effects of increasing SOC are inconsistent, ranging from negative to neutral to positive. We find that the promise of a win-win outcome is confirmed only when specific land management practices are applied under specific conditions. Therefore, we argue that the existing knowledge base does not justify the current trend to set global agendas focusing first and foremost on SOC sequestration. Away from climate-smart soils, we need a shift towards soil-smart agriculture, adaptative and adapted to each local context, and where multiple soil functions are quantified concurrently. Only such comprehensive assessments will allow synergies for land sustainability to be maximised and agronomic requirements for food security to be fulfilled. This implies moving away from global targets for SOC in agricultural soils. SOC sequestration may occur along this pathway and contribute to climate change mitigation and should be regarded as a co-benefit.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Marie Zwetsloot, Jan‐Willem van Groenigen, Jantiene Baartman and Rachel Creamer for internal reviews of draft manuscripts and suggestions for improvement.

There is growing evidence linking fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure to MetS. However, the influences of PM2.5 constituents, especially in children and adolescents, remain unclear. Our study was according to a national analysis among Chinese children and adolescents to examine the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 main constituents and MetS. A total of 10,066 children and adolescents aged 10-18 years were recruited in 7 provinces in China, with blood tests, health exams, and questionnaire surveys. We estimated long-term exposures to PM2.5 mass and its five constituents, containing black carbon (BC), organic matter (OM), inorganic nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO42-), and soil particles (SOIL) from multi-source data fusion models. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used with the adjustment of a variety of covariates. In the surveyed populations, 2.9% were classified as MetS. From the single-pollutant models, we discovered that long-term exposures to PM2.5 mass, BC, OM, NO3-, as well as SO42-, were significantly associated with the prevalence of MetS, with odds ratios (ORs) per 1 μg/m3 that were 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.03) for PM2.5 mass, 1.24 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.35) for BC, 1.07 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.11) for OM, 1.09 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.13) for NO3-, and 1.14 (95% CI:1.04, 1.24) for SO42-. The influence of BC on the prevalence of MetS was robust in both the multi-pollutant model and the PM2.5-constituent joint model. The paper indicates long-term exposure to PM2.5 mass and specific PM2.5 constituents, particularly for BC, was significantly associated with a higher MetS prevalence among children and adolescents in China.

The response of carbon release and microbial communities to FTCs has not been well characterized. Here, we conducted laboratory incubation experiments to investigate the relationships among carbon emissions, bacterial community, and soil variables in a permafrost-affected forest-wetland ecotone in Northeast China. The emission rates of CO2 and CH4 increased during the FTCs. FTC amplitude, FTC frequency, and patch type had significant effects on carbon emissions. FTCs increased the contents of soil DOC, NH4+-N, and NO3--N but reduced bacterial alpha diversity. CO2 emissions were mainly affected by bacterial alpha diversity and composition, and the inorganic nitrogen content was the important factor affecting CH4 emissions. Our findings indicated that FTCs could significantly regulate CO2 and CH4 emissions by reducing bacterial community diversity and increasing the concentration of available soil substrates. Our findings shed new light on the microorganism-substrate mechanisms regulating the response patterns of the soil carbon cycle to FTCs in permafrost regions.",,"This research was funded by the Key Joint Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and Heilongjiang Province for Regional Development (U20A2082), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41971151, 41941015), and Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China (No. TD2019D002).",Microorganisms,,Christopher P.

5841,pub.1155308438,10.1111/gcb.16632,36764676,,Assessing long‐term impacts of cover crops on soil organic carbon in the central US Midwestern agroecosystems,"Cover crops have been reported as one of the most effective practices to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) for agroecosystems. Impacts of cover crops on SOC change vary depending on soil properties, climate, and management practices, but it remains unclear how these control factors affect SOC benefits from cover crops, as well as which management practices can maximize SOC benefits. To address these questions, we used an advanced process-based agroecosystem model, ecosys, to assess the impacts of winter cover cropping on SOC accumulation under different environmental and management conditions. We aimed to answer the following questions: (1) To what extent do cover crops benefit SOC accumulation, and how do SOC benefits from cover crops vary with different factors (i.e., initial soil properties, cover crop types, climate during the cover crop growth period, and cover crop planting and terminating time)? (2) How can we enhance SOC benefits from cover crops under different cover crop management options? Specifically, we first calibrated and validated the ecosys model at two long-term field experiment sites with SOC measurements in Illinois. We then applied the ecosys model to six cover crop field experiment sites spanning across Illinois to assess the impacts of different factors on SOC accumulation. Our modeling results revealed the following findings: (1) Growing cover crops can bring SOC benefits by 0.33 ± 0.06 MgC ha-1  year-1 in six cover crop field experiment sites across Illinois, and the SOC benefits are species specific to legume and non-legume cover crops. (2) Initial SOC stocks and clay contents had overall small influences on SOC benefits from cover crops. During the cover crop growth period (i.e., winter and spring in the US Midwest), high temperature increased SOC benefits from cover crops, while the impacts from larger precipitation on SOC benefits varied field by field. (3) The SOC benefits from cover crops can be maximized by optimizing cover crop management practices (e.g., selecting cover crop types and controlling cover crop growth period) for the US Midwestern maize-soybean rotation system. Finally, we discussed the economic and policy implications of adopting cover crops in the US Midwest, including that current economic incentives to grow cover crops may not be sufficient to cover costs. This study systematically assessed cover crop impacts for SOC change in the US Midwest context, while also demonstrating that the ecosys model, with rigorous validation using field experiment data, can be an effective tool to guide the adaptive management of cover crops and quantify SOC benefits from cover crops. The study thus provides practical tools and insights for practitioners and policy-makers to design cover crop related government agricultural policies and incentive programs for farmers and agri-food related industries.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Authors acknowledge the support from the Illinois Nutrient Research &amp; Education Council (NREC), NSF CAREER Award (1847334), USDA NIFA Program (2017‐67013‐26253, 2018‐68002‐27961 and Hatch), and Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research.

We here conducted a soil column experiment to evaluate the after-effects of hydrochar amendment at 0.5 and 2.0 wt% on vegetable production, N recovery and losses via leaching and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from water-spinach (Ipomoea aquatica Forsk)-planted vegetable soil receiving three N inputs (120, 160, and 200 kg/ha). The results showed that hydrochar with 2.0 wt% significantly (p < 0.05) improved the biomass yield of water spinach, receiving 120−160 kg N/ha by 11.6−14.2%, compared with no change in the hydrochar treatment. Hydrochar had no effect on total N content of water spinach, and only increased the total N recovery under 2.0 wt% given hydrochar amended treatment with 120 kg N/ha. Neither pH or EC of leachate was changed with N reduction or hydrochar application. However, in some cases, hydrochar changes the NH4+, NO3− and total N concentrations in leachate. When applied at 2.0 wt%, hydrochar significantly (p < 0.05) increased total N leaching losses by 28.9% and 57.1%, under 120 and 160 kg N/ha plot, respectively.

However, the driving factors regulating straw returning-induced SOC increase in China's uplands remain uncertain. This study conducted a meta-analysis by collecting data from 238 trials at 85 field sites. The results showed that straw returning significantly increased SOC content by an average of 16.1% ± 1.5% with an average sequestration rate of 0.26 ± 0.02 g kg-1 yr-1. The improvement effects were significantly better in the northern China (NE-NW-N) than in the eastern and central (E-C). SOC increases were more pronounced in C-rich and alkaline soils, in cold and dry climates, and under larger amounts of straw-C and moderate nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Longer experimental period resulted in higher SOC increase rates but lower SOC sequestration rates. Furthermore, partial correlation analysis and structural equation modelling revealed that total straw-C input was the key driving factor of SOC increase rate whereas straw returning duration was the dominant limiting factor of SOC sequestration rate across China. Climate conditions were potential limiting factors of SOC increase rate in NE-NW-N and SOC sequestration rate in E-C. It was suggested that straw returning with large application amounts should be more strongly recommended in uplands in NE-NW-N especially in the straw applications at the beginning, from the perspective of SOC sequestration.","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41730753), the Natural Science Foundation of the Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. 21KJB210010), and the Start-Up Grants from Nanjing Normal University.",,Journal of Environmental Management,,,"Soil; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Crops, Agricultural; Agriculture; China",2023-02-28,2023,2023-02-28,2023-06,335,,117590,Closed,Article,"Zhu, Chongchong; Zhong, Wenhui; Han, Cheng; Deng, Huan; Jiang, Yunbin","Zhu, Chongchong (Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Materials Cycling and Pollution Control, School of Geography, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, 210023, China.); Zhong, Wenhui (Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Materials Cycling and Pollution Control, School of Geography, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, 210023, China; Jiangsu Center for Collaborative Innovation in Geographical Information Resource Development and Application, Nanjing, 210023, China.); Han, Cheng (Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Materials Cycling and Pollution Control, School of Geography, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, 210023, China; Jiangsu Center for Collaborative Innovation in Geographical Information Resource Development and Application, Nanjing, 210023, China.); Deng, Huan (Jiangsu Center for Collaborative Innovation in Geographical Information Resource Development and Application, Nanjing, 210023, China; School of Environment, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, 210023, China.); Jiang, Yunbin (Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Materials Cycling and Pollution Control, School of Geography, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, 210023, China; Jiangsu Center for Collaborative Innovation in Geographical Information Resource Development and Application, Nanjing, 210023, China.

Global plastic production has been growing exponentially with an annual growth rate of 8.4% since 1950, equating to approximately 380 million tonnes per annum. A further 50 kg of plastic is now being produced for each person every year with production continuing to accelerate. Here, we discuss the human and planetary health hazards of all that plastic.

Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is one of the key co-benefits of the SLMP. The objective of this study was to estimate the spatial dynamics of SOC in 2010 and 2018 (before and after SLMP) and identify the SOC sequestration hotspots at landscape scale in four selected SLMP watersheds in the Ethiopian highlands. The specific objectives were to: 1) comparatively evaluate SOC sequestration estimation model building strategies using either a single watershed, a combined dataset from all watersheds, and leave-one-watershed-out using Random Forest (RF) model; 2) map SOC stock of 2010 and 2018 to estimate amount of SOC sequestration and potential; 3) evaluate the impacts of SLM practices on SOC in four SLMP watersheds. A total of 397 auger composite samples from the topsoil (0-20 cm depth) were collected in 2010, and the same number of samples were collected from the same locations in 2018. We used simple statistics to assess the SOC change between the two periods, and machine learning models to predict SOC stock spatially. The study showed that statistically significant variation (P < 0.05) of SOC was observed between the two years in two watersheds (Gafera and Adi Tsegora) whereas the differences were not significant in the other two watersheds (Yesir and Azugashuba). Comparative analysis of model-setups shows that a combined dataset from all the four watersheds to train and test RF outperform the other two strategies (a single watershed alone and a leave-one-watershed-out to train and test RF) during the testing dataset. Thus, this approach was used to predict SOC stock before (2010) and after (2018) land management interventions and to derive the SOC sequestration maps. We estimated the sequestrated, achievable and target level of SOC stock spatially in the four watersheds. We assessed the impact of SLM practices, specifically bunds, terraces, biological and various forms of tillage practices on SOC using partial dependency algorithms of prediction models. No tillage (NT) increased SOC in all watersheds. The combination of physical and biological interventions (""bunds + vegetations"" or ""terraces + vegetations"") resulted in the highest SOC stock, followed by the biological intervention. The achievable SOC stock analysis showed that further SOC stock sequestration of up to 13.7 Mg C ha--1 may be possible in the Adi Tsegora, 15.8 Mg C ha-1 in Gafera, 33.2 Mg C ha-1 in Azuga suba and 34.7 Mg C ha-1 in Yesir watersheds.","This work is conducted as part of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (BMZ) funded project on “Scaling up soil carbon enhancement interventions for food security and climate across complex landscapes in Kenya and Ethiopia (contract: 81206681)”.

To explore the effects of long-term N addition on nutrient stoichiometry in soil and plant components in forest ecosystem, a 10-year N addition experiment using ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) was conducted in a bamboo forest in the Rainy Zone of West China, where the background N deposition is the highest in the world. Four N treatment levels (+0, +50, +150, +300 kg N ha-1 yr-1) (CK, LN, MN, HN) were applied monthly since November 2007, and then, the C:N:P stoichiometry of soil, microbial biomass, and enzymes in rhizosphere soil and bulk soil, and plant organs were measured. N addition decreased the stoichiometry of C:N:P of soil, microbial biomass, and enzymes. Soil C:N:P change under N addition treatments was stronger in bulk soil, while C:N:P changes for microbial biomass and enzyme activity were significant in rhizosphere soil. N addition significantly decreased TOC in bulk soil. Changes in MBC:MBN:MBP in rhizosphere and bulk soil were mainly caused by MBN and MBP, and MBP performance was consistent with that of AP. The main variable leading to the change of enzyme C:N:P in rhizosphere soil was BG and AP, and in bulk soil was LAP + NAG activity. Plant root C:P and N:P increased with N addition, while those for leaves and twigs did not. N addition significantly reduced the pH of both rhizosphere and bulk soils. These results suggest that the stoichiometry responses of rhizosphere and bulk soils were different due to the influence of plant roots. Soil acidification, enhanced aluminum toxicity potential, decreased root biomass and enhanced microbial P limitation caused by N addition were the important mechanisms that promoted stoichiometry changes in this ecosystem. Under the chronic input of N deposition, the stoichiometry between plant and soil evolved in different directions, which may lead to the decoupling of plants from soils.","This project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 32071591].

Se can generally be discharged in the potable water through natural and anthropogenic activities. Both excess and shortage of Se can cause significant adverse health effects in humans. Excess values of se may stimulate toxicity, leading to selenosis and alkali disease in humans and grazing animals, respectively.
Methods: A review search was systematically carried out from the databases Embase, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, PubMed Central (PMC), Google Scholar, as well as medRxiv by using the following keywords: ""waste water"", ""bioremediation"", ""selenium removal"", ""adsorption"", and ""drinking water"". This study provides a review of the recent literature covering the period between 2011 and 2021. After screening the full text of the articles, 27 papers were enrolled. This study reviews the reported techniques for Se removal from water and wastewater, including adsorption, biological treatment, microbial reduction, bioreactors, fungal bioreactor, algal treatment, phytoremediation, and photocatalysis.
Results: Biological and bioremediation techniques, such as microbial reduction, biotransformation, and fluidized bed reactor have removal efficiency about 100%. The highest Se concentration of 15-7600 μg/L was achieved in ground waters in Ethiopia and the lowest level of 0.07 μg/L in Finland.

We conducted a meta-analysis to (1) assess the effects of urbanization-induced land-use conversion on soil nitrous oxide (N2 O) and methane (CH4 ) fluxes, (2) quantify direct N2 O emission factors (EFd ) of fertilized urban soils used, for example, as lawns or forests, and (3) identify the key drivers leading to flux changes associated with urbanization. On average, urbanization increases soil N2 O emissions by 153%, to 3.0 kg N ha-1  year-1 , while rates of soil CH4 uptake are reduced by 50%, to 2.0 kg C ha-1  year-1 . The global mean annual N2 O EFd of fertilized lawns and urban forests is 1.4%, suggesting that urban soils can be regional hotspots of N2 O emissions. On a global basis, conversion of land to urban greenspaces has increased soil N2 O emission by 0.46 Tg N2 O-N year-1 and decreased soil CH4 uptake by 0.58 Tg CH4 -C year-1 . Urbanization driven changes in soil N2 O emission and CH4 uptake are associated with changes in soil properties (bulk density, pH, total N content, and C/N ratio), increased temperature, and management practices, especially fertilizer use. Overall, our meta-analysis shows that urbanization increases soil N2 O emissions and reduces the role of soils as a sink for atmospheric CH4 .

Simulated nitrogen (N) deposition is important to agriculture and has considerable impacts on plant phenolic metabolism but a systematic understanding of such effects is lacking. We here synthesized results from 123 articles and evaluated the responses of plant biomass, in vivo N status, soluble sugar concentrations, carbon (C)/N ratios and multiple phenolic compounds to the simulated N deposition. This meta-analysis showed that the simulated N deposition significantly increased plant biomass and N content but reduced the concentrations of phenolic compounds in a dose-depended manner. This was linked to the suppression of phenolic generating phenylalanine ammonia_lyase activity and key associated gene expression by the simulated N deposition. Total phenolic concentrations were negatively related to biomass but were positively correlated with C/N and soluble sugar contents. Overall, our results indicated adverse effects of simulated N deposition on phenolic metabolism which could compromise key aspects of crop quality and are apparently hidden by positive effects on plant biomass. Our findings have significant ecological and biological implications for plant phenolic metabolism facing global N deposition.","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20180312), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0200900 and 2017YFD0200206).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Biomass; Carbon; Nitrogen; Plants; Soil,2020-02-20,2020,2020-02-20,2020-06,719,,137442,Closed,Article,"Sun, Yuming; Guo, Junjie; Li, Yingrui; Luo, Gongwen; Li, Ling; Yuan, Haiyan; Mur, Luis Alejandro Jose; Guo, Shiwei","Sun, Yuming (Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab of Solid Organic Waste Utilization, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Solid Organic Wastes, Educational Ministry Engineering Center of Resource-saving fertilizers, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory for the Research and Utilization of Plant Resources, Institute of Botany, Jiangsu Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210014, China.

However, due to the variability of experimental conditions, types of biochar and soil, the influence of biochar on the accumulation of different soil carbon fractions remains unclear. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed that included 586 paired comparisons obtained from 169 studies conducted in various countries around the globe. The data set average showed significant relative increases of 64.3, 84.3, 20.1, 22.9 and 42.1% for total C, organic C, microbial biomass C, labile C and fulvic acid, respectively. The dissolved organic C, humic acid and humin fractions showed no significant variations. The relative increase in TC was favored by increasing biochar rates applied to fine-textured soils with low C content in temperate climate regions seen through short-term experiments conducted under controlled conditions. This behavior was different for each soil C fraction. Therefore, variations between experimental conditions, types of biochar and soil show that it is necessary to consider multiple factors when choosing the conditions of biochar use to maximize C sequestration in the soil and/or the increase of labile C fractions in the soil.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Environmental Management,,,Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Charcoal; Soil,2022-01-03,2022,2022-01-03,2022-03,305,,114403,Closed,Article,"Chagas, Jhon Kenedy Moura; Figueiredo, Cícero Célio de; Ramos, Maria Lucrécia Gerosa","Chagas, Jhon Kenedy Moura (Faculty of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine, University of Brasília, 70910-970, Brasília, DF, Brazil.); Figueiredo, Cícero Célio de (Faculty of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine, University of Brasília, 70910-970, Brasília, DF, Brazil.

However, nearly all previous articles have focused on the impact of additive amounts on the reduction of HMs, which may not fully represent the main factor shaping HMs bioavailability status during composting. Simultaneously, previous reviews only explored the impacts, speciation, and toxicity mechanism of HMs during composting. Hence, a global-scale meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the response patterns of HMs bioavailability and compost parameters to different additives, composting duration, and composting factors (additive types, feedstock, bulking agents, and composting methods) by measuring the weighted mean values of the response ratio ""[ln (RR)]"" and size effect (%). The results revealed that additives significantly lessened HMs bioavailability by ≥ 40% in the final compost products than controls. The bioavailability decline rates were -40%, -60%, -57%, -55%, -42%, and -44% for Zn, Pb, Ni, Cu, Cr, and Cd. Simultaneously, additives significantly improved the total nitrogen (TN) (+16%), pH (+5%), and temperature (+5%), and decreased total organic carbon (TOC) (-17%), moisture content (MC) (-18%), and C/N ratio (-19%). Furthermore, we found that the prolongation of composting time significantly promoted the effect of additives on declining HMs bioavailability (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, increasing additive amounts revealed an insignificant impact on decreasing the HMs bioavailability (p > 0.05). Eventually, using zeolite as an additive, chicken manure as feedstock, sawdust as a bulking agent, and a reactor as composting method had the most significant reduction effect on HMs bioavailability (p < 0.05). The findings of this meta-analysis may contribute to the selection, modification, and application of additives and composting factors to manage the level of bioavailable HMs in the compost products.","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31971554) and the Natural Science Foundation of Guang-dong Province, China (No. 2019A1515012206).",,Environmental Pollution,,,"Biological Availability; Composting; Manure; Metals, Heavy; Sewage; Soil",2022-05-26,2022,2022-05-26,2022-08,307,,119549,Closed,Article,"Yousif Abdellah, Yousif Abdelrahman; Shi, Zhao-Ji; Luo, Yu-Sen; Hou, Wen-Tao; Yang, Xi; Wang, Rui-Long","Yousif Abdellah, Yousif Abdelrahman (Department of Ecology, College of Natural Resources and Environment, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.); Shi, Zhao-Ji (Department of Ecology, College of Natural Resources and Environment, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.); Luo, Yu-Sen (Department of Ecology, College of Natural Resources and Environment, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Eco-circular Agriculture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Guangdong Engineering Technology Research Centre of Modern Eco-agriculture and Circular Agriculture, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Key Laboratory of Agro-Environment in the Tropics, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.); Hou, Wen-Tao (Department of Ecology, College of Natural Resources and Environment, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Eco-circular Agriculture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Guangdong Engineering Technology Research Centre of Modern Eco-agriculture and Circular Agriculture, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Key Laboratory of Agro-Environment in the Tropics, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.); Yang, Xi (Department of Ecology, College of Natural Resources and Environment, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Eco-circular Agriculture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Guangdong Engineering Technology Research Centre of Modern Eco-agriculture and Circular Agriculture, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Key Laboratory of Agro-Environment in the Tropics, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.); Wang, Rui-Long (Department of Ecology, College of Natural Resources and Environment, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Eco-circular Agriculture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Guangdong Engineering Technology Research Centre of Modern Eco-agriculture and Circular Agriculture, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Key Laboratory of Agro-Environment in the Tropics, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Heyuan Branch, Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture, Heyuan, 517000, China.

Agricultural management practices are crucial to offset the anthropogenic C emission; hence, Carbon sequestration (CS) in agriculture is a viable option for reversing this cycle, but it is based on hypotheses that must be questioned in order to contribute to the development of new agricultural techniques. This review summarizes a global perspective focusing on 5 developing countries (DC) (Bangladesh, Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria and Mexico) because of their importance on global C budget and on the agricultural sector as well as the impact produced by several global practices such as tillage, agroforestry systems, silvopasture, 4p1000 on CO2 sequestration. We also discussed about global policies regarding CS and tools available to measure CS. We found that among all practices agroforestry deemed to be the most promising approach and conversion from pasture to agroforestry will be favorable to both farmers and in changing climate, (e.g., agroforestry systems can generate 725 Euroeq C credit in EU) while some strategies (e.g. no-tillage) supposed to be less promising and over-hyped. In terms of conservative tillage (no-, reduced-, and minimal tillage systems), global and DC's land use increased. However, the impact of no-tillage is ambiguous since the beneficial impact is only limited to top soil (0-10 cm) as opposed to conventional mechanisms. Grasses, cereals and cover crops have higher potential of CS in their soils. While the 4p1000 initiative appears to be successful in certain areas, further research is needed to validate this possible mode of CS. Furthermore, for effective policy design and implementation to obtain more SOC stock, we strongly emphasize to include farmers globally as they are the one and only sustainable driver, hence, government and associated authorities should take initiatives (e.g., stimulus incentives, C credits) to form C market and promote C plantings. Otherwise, policy failure may occur. Moreover, to determine the true effect of these activities or regulations on CS, we must concurrently analyze SOC stock adjustments using models or direct measurements. Above all, SOC is the founding block of sustainable agriculture and inextricably linked with food security. Climate-smart managing of agriculture is very crucial for a massive SOC stock globally especially in DC's.","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (MX) is thankfully acknowledged for partially supporting this work under Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (SNI) program awarded to Elda M.

However, the impact of the environment on the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks consecutive to orchard grass coverage remain poorly quantified at a large scale. The present study aimed to examine the responses of SOC stocks to grass coverage at a soil depth of 0-30 cm in orchards compared to clean tillage. A total of 342 observations across China from 139 peer-reviewed publications were subjected to meta-analysis. Aggregated boosted tree analysis was performed, evaluating the determinants of SOC stocks, such as plant traits (e.g., fruit tree type, grass type, orchard age, and grass age), edaphic variables (e.g., initial SOC and nitrogen concentration, soil pH, and soil clay content), climatic factors (e.g., mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT)), and management practices (e.g., grass source, grass growing mode, fertilization, grass mowing, placement of mowed residues, and irrigation). On average, orchard grass coverage significantly enhanced SOC stocks by 21.47% (percentage change) compared to clean tillage. Biotic and abiotic factors influenced this increase in SOC stocks following grass coverage in orchards to different extents. Grass age and soil clay content were the main determinants driving the variation in the SOC stocks following grass coverage in orchards. Thus, we propose an efficient way to optimize C sequestration in grass covered orchards, regarding plant traits, climatic factors, edaphic variables, and management practices. Longer than 12 months of surface grass coverage with cultivated grass species in mature deciduous fruit orchards (≥5 years) efficiently increased SOC stocks. This is particularly the case for acidic (pH < 6.5) soils with low C content (SOM < 15 g kg-1) in areas with suitable rainfall and temperature conditions (MAP ≥ 400 mm, MAT ≥ 10 °C). Collectively, this meta-analysis identified orchard grass coverage as a promising practice for significantly increasing SOC stocks at 0-30 cm across large geospatial locations in China.","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Non-profit Research Institution of Chinese Academy of Forestry (CAFYBB2020ZE005), Scientific Research Fund Project of Guizhou Education University (2020BS019; 2020BS023), Starting Research Fund of Team Construction of Lanzhou University ‘Double First-Rate’ project (561120207), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFF0305900), Natural Science Foundation of China (41861035, 32101431), Research Fund Program of Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology (No. 2020B1212060022), Gansu Province Science and Technology Plan Project (20CX9NA105), and National Key Technologies RD Program (2014BAD14B006).

Much of the fertile, low-lying land that was historically wetland is now farmed, so privately-owned locations play critical roles in regaining space for wetlands. However, wetland restoration on private property is often small-scale and supported by minimal funding and expertise. Little is known about what these efforts achieve, and what contexts facilitate the greatest gains in wetland health. Using a paired plot design for 18 restored and 18 unrestored wetlands, we aimed to understand changes in wetland health following restoration on private property. We characterised plant and microbial communities and soil characteristics following wetland restoration and explored how environmental settings of restored wetlands related to the clustering of wetland health indicators. We found that all indicators of wetland health significantly increased following restoration except for the ratio of Gram negative to Gram positive bacteria. Restoration enhanced plant alpha and beta diversity, adding ~13 native plant species per plot. Soils in restored wetlands contained 20% more organic matter, and 25% more microbial biomass, which was driven by an increased abundance of fungi. Restoration reduced soil bulk density by 0.19 g-1 cm3 and Olsen Phosphorus by 23%. These effects on soil physical characteristics and microbial communities were strongest in the wettest locations. Restored wetlands clustered into three main groups based on indicators of wetland health. Hydrological flow explained the clustering of wetlands, with riverine wetlands exhibiting greater indicators of recovery than depressional wetlands, suggesting that hydrological flow may influence post-restoration recovery. Overall, this study shows that small-scale wetland restoration on private land improved wetland health, providing evidence that it can be an effective use of marginal agricultural land.","We thank the landowners who participated in this study for access to their wetlands.

Our study showed that most of the soil functions in agroforestry systems is higher than in forests at the global scale, but show no significant differences between agroforestry and planted forests in our field study. We also found that the effects of agroforestry on soil multi-functionality were varied with agroforestry practices, showing a greater positive in forest-herbage systems than in other practices. In addition, the positive effects of agroforestry on soil organic carbon and total phosphorus declined with the extension of experimental duration. Furthermore, our analysis found that climate conditions had a minor effect on the effects of agroforestry on soil functions.

Whether minimizing soil disturbance, diversifying crop rotations, or re-establishing perennial grasslands and integrating livestock can slow or reverse this trend remains highly uncertain. We investigated how these management practices affected soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual and distribution between particulate (POM) and mineral-associated (MAOM) organic matter in a 29-y-old field experiment in the North Central United States and assessed how soil microbial traits were related to these changes. Compared to conventional continuous maize monocropping with annual tillage, systems with reduced tillage, diversified crop rotations with cover crops and legumes, or manure addition did not increase total SOC storage or MAOM-C, whereas perennial pastures managed with rotational grazing accumulated more SOC and MAOM-C (18 to 29% higher) than all annual cropping systems after 29 y of management. These results align with a meta-analysis of data from published studies comparing the efficacy of soil health management practices in annual cropping systems on Mollisols worldwide.

However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of GHGs emissions from the wetland ecosystems in China are still elusive. We synthesized 166 publications that contain 462 in situ measurements of GHGs emissions from the natural wetlands in China, and further analyzed the variability and the drivers of GHGs emissions in eight subdivisions of China's wetlands. The results show that the current studies are mainly concentrated in the estuaries, Sanjiang Plain, and Zoige wetlands. The average CO2 emissions, CH4 fluxes and N2O fluxes from Chinese wetlands were 218.84 mg·m-2·h-1, 1.95 mg·m-2·h-1 and 5.8 × 10-2 mg·m-2·h-1, respectively. The global warming potential (GWP) of China's wetlands was estimated to be 1881.36 TgCO2-eq·yr-1, with CO2 emissions contributing more than 65% to the GWP value. The combined GWP values of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau wetlands, coastal wetlands and northeastern wetlands account for 84.8% of GWP of China's wetlands. Correlation analysis showed that CO2 emissions increased with the increasing mean annual temperature, elevation, annual rainfall, and wetland water level, but decreased with soil pH. CH4 fluxes increased with the mean annual temperature and soil water content but decreased with the redox potential. This study analyzed the drivers of GHGs emissions from wetland ecosystems at the national scale, and GWP values of eight wetland subregions of China were comprehensively assessed. Our results are potentially useful for the global GHGs inventory, and can help assess the response of GHGs emissions of wetland ecosystem to environmental and climate change.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

To improve our understanding of this process, we conducted a meta-analysis of 371 observations from 87 published studies in 11 countries. The results showed that the difference in nitrogen content in feces significantly affected the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nutrient losses of subsequent composting, with NH3-N, CO2-C, and CH4-C losses all increasing with its rise. Windrow pile composting (especially compared to trough composting) had lower GHG emissions and nutrient loss. C/N ratio, aeration rate, and pH value significantly affected NH3 emission, and a decrease in the latter two can reduce it by 31.8 % and 42.5 %, respectively. Decreasing the moisture content or increasing the turning frequency could decrease CH4 by 31.8 % and 62.6 %, respectively. The addition of biochar or superphosphate had a synergistic emission reduction. The emission reduction of N2O and CH4 by biochar was more prominent (44 % and 43.6 %), while superphosphate on NH3 (38.0 %) was better. And the latter was more suitable if added in 10-20 % of dry weight. Dicyandiamide was the only chemical additive (59.4 %) with better N2O emission reduction performance. Microbial agents with different functions had certain effects on NH3-N emission reduction, while the mature compost had a certain effect on N2O-N emissions (67.0 %). In general, N2O had the highest contribution to the greenhouse effect during composting (74.22 %).","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

5818,pub.1147285206,10.1111/gcb.16205,35445477,,Phosphorus addition decreases plant lignin but increases microbial necromass contribution to soil organic carbon in a subalpine forest,"Increasing phosphorus (P) inputs induced by anthropogenic activities have increased P availability in soils considerably, with dramatic effects on carbon (C) cycling and storage. However, the underlying mechanisms via which P drives plant and microbial regulation of soil organic C (SOC) formation and stabilization remain unclear, hampering the accurate projection of soil C sequestration under future global change scenarios. Taking the advantage of an 8-year field experiment with increasing P addition levels in a subalpine forest on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, we explored plant C inputs, soil microbial communities, plant and microbial biomarkers, as well as SOC physical and chemical fractions. We found that continuous P addition reduced fine root biomass, but did not affect total SOC content. P addition decreased plant lignin contribution to SOC, primarily from declined vanillyl-type phenols, which was coincided with a reduction in methoxyl/N-alkyl C by 2.1%-5.5%. Despite a decline in lignin decomposition due to suppressed oxidase activity by P addition, the content of lignin-derived compounds decreased because of low C input from fine roots. In contrast, P addition increased microbial (mainly fungal) necromass and its contribution to SOC due to the slower necromass decomposition under reduced N-acquisition enzyme activity. The larger microbial necromass contribution to SOC corresponded with a 9.1%-12.4% increase in carbonyl C abundance. Moreover, P addition had no influence on the slow-cycing mineral-associated organic C pool, and SOC chemical stability indicated by aliphaticity and recalcitrance indices. Overall, P addition in the subalpine forest over 8 years influenced SOC composition through divergent alterations of plant- and microbial-derived C contributions, but did not shape SOC physical and chemical stability. Such findings may aid in accurately forecasting SOC dynamics and their potential feedbacks to climate change with future scenarios of increasing soil P availability in Earth system models.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42107323; 32171756; 31770658), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC0505002), the Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20020401; KFZD‐SW‐427), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2021M693111).

Biochar is suggested to be a highly beneficial substrate additive for green roof systems due to its low weight, high nutrient and water retention capacity, and recalcitrance. However, biochar is susceptible to wind and water erosion, which may result in biochar loss and negative environmental impacts. Applications of biochar as large particles or in granulated form may mitigate biochar erosion potential, but relevant data on plant performance and substrate properties are lacking. We examined the effects of granulated and conventional biochars at a range of particle sizes on plant performance of the drought-tolerant forb Agastache foeniculum. We found that granulated biochar strongly enhanced plant growth, reproduction, and physiological status, acting to neutralize pH and enhance water retention capacity of the substrate. In contrast, although conventional biochar reduced substrate bulk density and enhanced substrate total porosity and water retention capacity, it suppressed plant growth. Our results also suggest that granulated biochar at intermediate particle sizes (2-2.8 mm) best enhanced plant performance. We conclude that use of granulated biochars on green roofs can strongly promote plant performance while increasing water infiltration and retention.","We thank Melanie Sifton and Emily Lock for assistance with experiment setup and maintenance, and Titan Clean Energy Projects Co., Gro-Bark Inc., and Bioroof Systems Inc. for the provision of materials used in the experiment and relevant production information.

The effects of biochar on soil phosphorus (P) transformations have received much less attention than its effects on carbon cycling. A review of the literature reveals that biochar applications to soils may have notable effects on the abundance, speciation, availability, and leaching loss of soil P. However, a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the biochar-induced environmental behavior of soil P has not been obtained so far. Therefore, in this review, we analyzed and identified the known and potential mechanisms through which biochar affects P behavior in soils: (1) biochar as a source of P provides soluble and exchangeable P to soil; (2) biochar enhances the availability of endogenic soil P by influencing P-related complexation and metabolism effects; and (3) biochar affects P leaching losses directly or indirectly by adsorbing P, improving P retention by soil, and facilitating P assimilation by plants. By presenting a broad and detailed illustration of P behaviors in biochar-amended soils, this paper suggests that the application of biochar to soils will help enlarge soil P pools, increase soil P availability, and decrease P leaching losses from soil. Additional studies are needed to further elucidate the long-term effects of biochar addition on soil P transformations, explore how biochar-derived dissolved organic matter (BDOM) affects the mobility and availability of soil mineral-associated P, and examine the transport of particulate P in biochar-amended soils.","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41703097), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFA0207002), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2018T110078 and 2016M600070), and Beijing Natural Science Foundation (JQ19033).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Charcoal; Phosphorus; Soil; Soil Pollutants,2020-11-20,2020,2020-11-20,2021-03,758,,143657,Closed,Article,"Yang, Lu; Wu, Yunchao; Wang, Yichu; An, Weiqi; Jin, Jie; Sun, Ke; Wang, Xiangke","Yang, Lu (MOE Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Systems Optimization, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China.); Wu, Yunchao (MOE Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Systems Optimization, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China.); Wang, Yichu (MOE Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Systems Optimization, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China.); An, Weiqi (MOE Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Systems Optimization, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China.); Jin, Jie (MOE Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Systems Optimization, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China.

This study aimed (i) to perform a cradle-to-gate CFP of pasture-based beef cattle in a Mediterranean agropastoral system (ii) and to assess the effects on the CFP of alternative tillage, fertilizing, and grazing practices under current (NCC) and future climate change (CC) scenarios. Minimum (Mt) and no-tillage (Nt) practices were compared to current tillage (Ct); a 50% increase (Hf) and decrease (Lf) in fertilization was evaluated against the current (Cf) rate; and rotational grazing (Rg) was evaluated versus the current continuous grazing (Cg) system. The denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model was run using NCC as well as representative concentration pathways to investigate the effects of farm management practices coupled with future CC scenarios on SOC dynamics, N2O fluxes, and crop yield. Within NCC and CtCf, an emission intensity of 26.9 ± 0.7 kg CO2eq per kg live body weight was estimated. Compared to Ct, the adoption of Mt and Nt reduced the CFP by 20% and 35%, respectively, while NtHf reduced it by 40%.

Inventory guidelines are vital to implementing climate action, and we highlight opportunities to improve their timeliness and accuracy. Such reforms should provide the means to better understand and advance the progress countries are making toward their Paris commitments. Now is the time to consider challenges posed by the current process to develop the guidelines, and to avail the policy community of recent major advances in quantitative and expert synthesis to overhaul the process and thereby better equip multi-national efforts to limit climate change.","This project was funded by the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and the Yale Program in Grand Strategy.

Because of the extensive attention of global scholars on the sustainable development in China, much research has been published over the past 30 years. Based on the 12,635 journal papers from the Web of Science database, we explore the trends in the evolution of China’s sustainable development research by a knowledge graph. The result indicates that the attention of China’s sustainable development research increased exponentially during 1991–2021, and it continues to shift from a macroperspective to the exploration of specific methods and implementation paths. During 2001–2005, China’s sustainable development research developed rapidly and formed a complete cluster structure. In addition, China’s sustainable development research has experienced three stages and two topic drifts. Staged development and topic drifts lead to a wide range of disciplinary drifts. In general, the trends in the evolution of China’s sustainable development research mainly focus on three aspects: research methods, research scope, and theoretical innovation. China’s sustainable development provides a case or a path for other developing countries. Economic incentives and policy promotion remain important measures to promote sustainable development.",,"This research was supported by National Science Foundation of China (NSFC 72074046 and 71874029), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2022M712017), and Shanghai Post-doctoral Excellence Program (2021152).",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,China; Sustainable Development,2023-03-27,2023,2023-03-27,2023-04,30,20,57898-57914,All OA; Green,Article,"Shi, Shaoqing; Yin, Jianhua","Shi, Shaoqing (Shanghai WTO Affairs Consultation Center, Postdoctoral Station, 200336, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, Postdoctoral Station, 200020, Shanghai, China); Yin, Jianhua (Business School, University of International Business and Economics, 100029, Beijing, China)","Yin, Jianhua (University of International Business and Economics)","Shi, Shaoqing (Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences); Yin, Jianhua (University of International Business and Economics)",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2000729/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156532322,37 Earth Sciences; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Many studies have investigated the relative effect of straw return on SOC content, while the magnitude and efficiency of straw return in building up SOC stock remain uncertain. Here, we present an integrative synthesis of the magnitude and efficiency of SR-induced SOC changes, using a database comprising 327 observations at 115 sites globally. Straw return increased SOC by 3.68 ± 0.69 (95 % Confidence Interval, CI) Mg C ha-1, with a corresponding C efficiency of 20.51 ± 9.58 % (95 % CI), of which <30 % was contributed directly by straw-C input. The magnitude of SR-induced SOC changes increased (P < 0.05) with increasing straw-C input and experiment duration. However, the C efficiency decreased significantly (P < 0.01) with these two explanatory factors. No-tillage and crop rotation were found to enhance the SR-induced SOC increase, in both magnitude and efficiency. Straw return sequestrated larger amount of C in acidic and organic-rich soils than in alkaline and organic-poor soils. A machine learning random forest (RF) algorithm showed that the amount of straw-C input was the most important single factor governing the magnitude and efficiency of straw return. However, local agricultural managements and environmental conditions were together the dominant explanatory factors determining the spatial differences in SR-induced SOC stock changes. This entails that by optimizing agricultural managements in regions with favorable environmental conditions the farmer can accumulate more C with minor negative impacts. By clarifying the significance and relative importance of multiple local factors, our findings may aid the development of tailored region-specific straw return policies integrating the SOC increment and its environmental side costs.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Through the improvement and utilization of saline-alkali land to improve the carbon content in soil, it can not only become a reserve resource of cultivated land or grazing grassland, but also become an important land “carbon sink”. In this study, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to identify the impact of improvement and utilization of saline-alkali soil on soil organic carbon (SOC) in China. Our results showed that the soil salt and alkali content in Heilongjiang Province and Jilin Province in China was the highest, with an SOC content between 3.05 and 17.8 g/kg and pH between 8.84 and 9.94. Among the five methods of reclamation, halophyte planting, fertilization, biochar and modifier application, only biochar and modifier application significantly increased the SOC content (p < 0.05). The content of SOC in saline-alkali soil was 2.9−6.3 g/kg before biochar application, and significantly increased to 6.2−13.05 g/kg after biochar application (p < 0.01). The SOC content was 3.05−8.12 g/kg before the application of the modifier, and significantly increased to 3.68−9 g/kg (p < 0.05) after the application of the modifier. After utilization and improvement of saline-alkali land, the total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium also increased significantly (p < 0.05). This study provides a scientific basis for further understanding the improvement and utilization of saline-alkali land in China and its potential for increasing carbon sinks.","We thank Cong Wang from the Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences for his comments and suggestions to improve our paper.","This research was funded by the Yinshanbeilu Grassland Eco-hydrology National Observation and Research Station, China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research, Beijing 100038, China, Grant No. YSS2022017, Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2021ZY82), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U20A2007, 72050001, 32201398) and the National Key R&D Program of China (2021FED1124000).",Life,,,,2022-11-13,2022,2022-11-13,,12,11,1870,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yang, Shuai; Hao, Xinghai; Xu, Yiming; Yang, Juejie; Su, Derong","Yang, Shuai (School of Grassland Science, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing 100083, China.); Hao, Xinghai (School of Grassland Science, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing 100083, China.); Xu, Yiming (School of Grassland Science, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing 100083, China.); Yang, Juejie (School of Grassland Science, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing 100083, China.); Su, Derong (School of Grassland Science, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing 100083, China.)","Yang, Juejie (Beijing Forestry University); Su, Derong (Beijing Forestry University)","Yang, Shuai (Beijing Forestry University); Hao, Xinghai (Beijing Forestry University); Xu, Yiming (Beijing Forestry University); Yang, Juejie (Beijing Forestry University); Su, Derong (Beijing Forestry University)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/12/11/1870/pdf?version=1668330748,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152740548,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 3104 Evolutionary Biology; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4601 Applied Computing,15 Life on Land
5812,pub.1154227539,10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.117142,36608610,,Carbon farming: Are soil carbon certificates a suitable tool for climate change mitigation?,"Increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in agricultural soils removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and contributes towards achieving carbon neutrality. For farmers, higher SOC levels have multiple benefits, including increased soil fertility and resilience against drought-related yield losses. However, increasing SOC levels requires agricultural management changes that are associated with costs. Private soil carbon certificates could compensate for these costs. In these schemes, farmers register their fields with commercial certificate providers who certify SOC increases. Certificates are then sold as voluntary emission offsets on the carbon market. In this paper, we assess the suitability of these certificates as an instrument for climate change mitigation. From a soils' perspective, we address processes of SOC enrichment, their potentials and limits, and options for cost-effective measurement and monitoring. From a farmers' perspective, we assess management options likely to increase SOC, and discuss their synergies and trade-offs with economic, environmental and social targets. From a governance perspective, we address requirements to guarantee additionality and permanence while preventing leakage effects. Furthermore, we address questions of legitimacy and accountability. While increasing SOC is a cornerstone for more sustainable cropping systems, private carbon certificates fall short of expectations for climate change mitigation as permanence of SOC sequestration cannot be guaranteed. Governance challenges include lack of long-term monitoring, problems to ensure additionality, problems to safeguard against leakage effects, and lack of long-term accountability if stored SOC is re-emitted. We conclude that soil-based private carbon certificates are unlikely to deliver the emission offset attributed to them and that their benefit for climate change mitigation is uncertain. Additional research is needed to develop standards for SOC change metrics and monitoring, and to better understand the impact of short term, non-permanent carbon removals on peaks in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and on the probability of exceeding climatic tipping points.","The authors would like to thank K.C.

However, a comprehensive understanding of antibiotic accumulation, distribution, and potential risks to terrestrial ecosystems on a global scale is still limited. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the accumulation of antibiotics and their potential risks to soil microorganisms and plants, and highlighted the driving factors of antibiotic accumulation in agricultural soils based on 134 peer-reviewed studies (between 2000 and 2022). The results indicated that 56 types of antibiotics were detected at least once in agricultural soils with concentrations ranging from undetectable to over 7000 µg/kg. Doxycycline, tylosin, sulfamethoxazole, and enrofloxacin, belonging to the tetracyclines, macrolides, sulfonamides, and fluoroquinolones, respectively, were the most accumulated antibiotics in agricultural soil. The accumulation of TCs, SAs, and FQs was found to pose greater risks to soil microorganisms (average at 29.3%, 15.4%, and 21.8%) and plants (42.4%, 26.0%, and 38.7%) than other antibiotics. East China was identified as a hot spot for antibiotic contamination due to high levels of antibiotic concentration and ecological risk to soil microorganisms and plants. Antibiotic accumulation was found to be higher in vegetable fields (245.5 µg/kg) and orchards (212.4 µg/kg) compared to croplands (137.2 µg/kg). Furthermore, direct land application of manure resulted in a greater accumulation of TCs, SAs, and FQs accumulation in soils than compost fertilization. The level of antibiotics decreased with increasing soil pH and organic matter content, attributed to decreasing adsorption and enhancing degradation of antibiotics. In conclusion, this study highlights the need for further research on the impacts of antibiotics on soil ecological function in agricultural fields and their interaction mechanisms. Additionally, a whole-chain approach, consisting of antibiotic consumption reduction, manure management strategies, and remediation technology for soil contaminated with antibiotics, is needed to eliminate the potential environmental risks of antibiotics for sustainable and green agriculture.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Fulvic acid and manure are ones of the exogenous organic materials used for the improvement of degraded soil. However, little is known about if and how fulvic acid and manure affect the stability of MAOM. Using a field experiment of four fertilization treatments (no fertilization, mineral fertilizers, fulvic acid, and manure) and a comprehensive meta-analysis using relevant studies published prior to January 2020, we investigated effects of exogenous fulvic acid and manure applications on four MAOM stability indexes: association intensity, humus stabilization index, iron oxide complex coefficient, and aluminum oxide complex coefficient. Exogenous fulvic acid and manure applications increased soil organic carbon fractions by 26.04–48.47%, MAOM stability by 12.26–387.41%, and complexed iron/aluminum contents by 16.12–20.01%. Fulvic acid application increased MAOM stability by promoting mineral oxide complexation by 20.33% and manure application improved MAOM stability via increasing humus stabilization by 21–25%. Association intensity was positively correlated with contents of soil carbon fractions and the metal oxide complex coefficients were positively correlated with iron/aluminum oxide contents. Moreover, stable-humus exerted significantly positive direct and indirect effects on association intensity and humus stabilization index, while amorphous iron/aluminum content had significantly negative influences on metal oxide complex coefficients. The meta-analysis verified that long-term fulvic acid application improved MAOM stability more so than manure application in acidic soils. We recommend that strategies aiming to prevent land degradation should focus on the potential of fulvic acid as a soil amendment because it can significantly increase MAOM stability.",,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Benzopyrans; Carbon; Fertilizers; Manure; Minerals; Soil,2021-09-10,2021,2021-09-10,2022-02,29,7,9805-9816,Closed,Article,"Zhang, Yang; Zhang, Xiaojia; Wen, Jiong; Wang, Yanan; Zhang, Nan; Jia, Yuehui; Su, Shiming; Wu, Cuixia; Zeng, Xibai","Zhang, Yang (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, 100081, Beijing, China); Zhang, Xiaojia (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, 100081, Beijing, China); Wen, Jiong (Yueyang Agricultural Environment Scientific Experiment Station, Ministry of Agriculture, 414000, Yueyang, China); Wang, Yanan (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, 100081, Beijing, China); Zhang, Nan (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, 100081, Beijing, China); Jia, Yuehui (College of Bio-Science and Resource Environment, Beijing University of Agriculture, 102206, Beijing, China); Su, Shiming (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, 100081, Beijing, China); Wu, Cuixia (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, 100081, Beijing, China); Zeng, Xibai (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, 100081, Beijing, China)","Zhang, Yang (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture); Zeng, Xibai (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture)","Zhang, Yang (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture); Zhang, Xiaojia (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture); Wen, Jiong (); Wang, Yanan (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture); Zhang, Nan (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture); Jia, Yuehui (Beijing University of Agriculture); Su, Shiming (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture); Wu, Cuixia (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture); Zeng, Xibai (Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture)",3,3,,1.72,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141003167,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3002 Agriculture, Land and Farm Management",15 Life on Land

Here, we present the first meta-analysis to quantify the general response of two major arthropod taxa, terrestrial isopods and millipedes to urbanization and to reveal the underlying mechanisms. Climatic (temperature, precipitation, growing season length), edaphic (pH, organic carbon, CaCO3 and clay content of surface soils), urban (population density, city age, vegetation cover and mean actual evapotranspiration) parameters and methods of study (duration, sampling technique, replications) were used as moderators. We used a hierarchical meta-analytic approach to consider the dependence of multiple effect sizes obtained from one study. Altogether 156 paired observations were extracted from 59 urban studies conducted between 1980 and 2020. Urbanization had a negative effect on species diversity (species richness and Shannon index) of both macroarthropod taxa. However, both the direction and strength of their abundance response varied to a greater extent, resulting in a neutral effect of urban disturbance on them. The key drivers influencing the urban effects on macroarthropods were mean annual temperature and precipitation, absolute minimum temperature and length of growing season. The study also highlighted the importance of sampling methods: direct sampling (hand collecting) resulted in stronger urban effects presumably due to several sources of sampling bias. Our global synthesis highlighted that urbanization is a threat to soil arthropods, particularly to litter-dwelling detritivores, which potentially alters plant residue processing and ultimately soil biogeochemical cycles.","We are very grateful to the authors (Ferenc Vilisics, Michael Driessen, Michael E.

However, it is necessary to determine which type of amendment produces the most desirable results. We conducted a 3-y field study comparing one-time addition of manure compost and its biochar derivative to a control to assess their effects on SOC and GHG emissions at ten annually cropped sites in central Alberta, Canada. Manure compost and biochar were applied at equivalent carbon rates (7 Mg ha-1) and tilled into the surface 10 cm of soil. Two years post-treatment, biochar addition increased surface (0-10 cm) SOC by 12 and 10 Mg ha-1 relative to the control and manure addition, respectively. Therefore, biochar addition led to the sequestration of SOC at a rate of 2.5 Mg ha-1 y-1 relative to the control. No treatment effect on deeper (10-100 cm) or cumulative SOC was found. In 2018 and 2019, manure addition increased cumulative GHG (sum of CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions by 33%, on average, due to greater CO2 emissions relative to both the control and biochar addition. In contrast, in 2020, biochar addition reduced cumulative GHG emissions by an average of 21% due to lower CO2 emissions relative to both the control and manure addition. Our study shows that the application of biochar, rather than its manure compost feedstock, increased surface SOC sequestration and had either no effect on (first two years) or reduced GHG emissions (year three) relative to the control. We recommend that policy and carbon sequestration initiatives focus on optimizing biochar production-application systems to fully realize the potential of biochar application as a viable climate change mitigation practice in agriculture.","We express our gratitude to the landowners and farmers for their generosity, assistance, and cooperation throughout the duration of the study.

However, few studies have compared the effects of straw return on the yield, SOC, and N2O emissions of various crops. Which management strategies are the best for balancing yield, SOC, and emission reduction for various crops needs to be clarified. A meta-analysis containing 2269 datasets collected from 369 studies was conducted to investigate the influence of agricultural management strategies on yield increase, soil carbon sequestration, and emission reduction in various crops after the straw return. Analytical results indicated that, on average, straw return increased the yield of rice, wheat, and maize by 5.04%, 8.09%, and 8.71%, respectively. Straw return increased maize N2O emissions by 14.69% but did not significantly affect wheat N2O emissions. Interestingly, straw return reduced the rice N2O emissions by 11.43% but increased the CH4 emissions by 72.01%. The recommended nitrogen application amounts for balancing yield, SOC, and emission reduction varied among the three crops, while the recommended straw return amounts were more than 9000 kg/ha. The optimal tillage and straw return strategies for rice, wheat, and maize were plow tillage combined with incorporation, rotary tillage combined with incorporation, and no-tillage combined with mulching, respectively. A straw return duration of 5-10 years for rice and maize and ≤5 years for wheat was recommended. These findings provide optimal agricultural management strategies after straw return to balance the crop yield, SOC, and emission reduction for China's three major grain crops.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, the effect of biochar on typical environmental processes in anaerobic soil environment has been insufficiently discussed. By regulating the electron donors with sodium acetate or pyruvate, the effects and underpinning chemical-microbiological coupling mechanisms of biochar under anaerobic conditions were disclosed. Unlike the electron limited condition, the addition of electron donors alleviated the competition for electrons among various reduction processes in the soil. The effect of biochar in regulating the electron transfer processes was lessened. But more than doubled methane emissions were resulted by the exogenous substances, especially with the synergic effect of biochar. Biochar addition increased soil environmental heterogeneity. It might indirectly affect the reductive transformation of γ-HCH via increasing the bioavailability of pollutants through adsorption and promoting the metabolism of some rare microorganisms. Anaerolineaceae, Peptococcaceae and Methanosarcina had coherent phylogenetic patterns and were likely to be the enablers for the reductive dechlorination process in flooded soil. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATION: Previous studies have widely reported the performance characteristics of biochar, but its effects under anaerobic environments are not systematically understood. By regulating the electron donors, the competition for electrons among various reduction processes in the soil might be alleviated, resulting in a lessened effect of biochar in regulating the electron transfer processes. The findings presented in this study highlight the role of biochar to the dynamic changes of reduction processes under anaerobic environments. The relevant soil conditions such as the electron donors and the functional microbial groups should be adequately considered for maximizing the all-around beneficial efficiency of biochar amendments.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers are the main producers of nitrous oxide (N2 O), but it remains unclear how ammonia oxidizer and denitrifier abundances will respond to N loading and whether their responses can predict N-induced changes in soil N2 O emission. By synthesizing 101 field studies worldwide, we showed that N loading significantly increased ammonia oxidizer abundance by 107% and denitrifier abundance by 45%. The increases in both ammonia oxidizer and denitrifier abundances were primarily explained by N loading form, and more specifically, organic N loading had stronger effects on their abundances than mineral N loading. Nitrogen loading increased soil N2 O emission by 261%, whereas there was no clear relationship between changes in soil N2 O emission and shifts in ammonia oxidizer and denitrifier abundances. Our field-based results challenge the laboratory-based hypothesis that increased ammonia oxidizer and denitrifier abundances by N loading would directly cause higher soil N2 O emission. Instead, key abiotic factors (mean annual precipitation, soil pH, soil C:N ratio, and ecosystem type) explained N-induced changes in soil N2 O emission. Altogether, these findings highlight the need for considering the roles of key abiotic factors in regulating soil N transformations under N loading to better understand the microbially mediated soil N2 O emission.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the authors whose work was included in this meta‐analysis.

A meta-analysis,"The straw returning technique is one of the important measures for soil carbon sequestration and soil organic carbon (SOC) promotion in the world. However, the patterns of straw utilization in China with various methods among regions, the effect and variability of straw returning on SOC in different areas of China remain uncertain. We conducted a meta-analysis of 446 sets of data from 95 studies in China field to explore how the environmental factors and field management affect SOC after straw returning. The results showed that straw returning to the field significantly increase SOC content by an average of 13.97% (n = 446). The SOC increased effects are more obvious under areas with mean annual precipitation (MAP) > 500 mm, temperature (MAT) > 10 °C, loam or sandy soil, or the initial SOC content <10 g kg-1. The effect of straw returning on SOC also depends on planting systems, ranging from 5.43% of rice continuous cropping to 17.05% of the maize-wheat ration. In the rotation system, the SOC increasing effect under paddy-wheat rotation (15.79% in rice and 14.87% in wheat season) was more significant than under wheat-maize rotation (17.05% in wheat and 11.81% in maize season). The proper duration of straw returning is 6-9 years, while it will decrease SOC by 17.06%-20.05% more than 10 years. Moreover, the effects of straw returning under the conditions with deep tillage, the amount of straw more than 9000 kg ha-1, or combined pure N with 180-240 kg N ha-1 were better than other methods.","This research was financially supported by grants from the National Key RD Program of China (No. 2017YFD0301106), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31601258 and No. 31471452).

However, the responses of SOC to managed and natural vegetation restoration strategies at a large scale are poorly understood due to the varying SOC components and changing climatic conditions. Here, we measured bulk SOC, particulate organic carbon (POC), and mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC) after 15 years of vegetation restoration along an elevation gradient with a corresponding temperature gradient in the calcareous soils of karst region, Southwest China. We compared managed plantation forest and naturally recovered shrubland vegetation restoration strategies, using cropland and mature forest as references. Overall, we found that the SOC and POC densities in both plantation forest and shrubland were significantly higher than in the cropland but lower than in the mature forest. There were no significant differences in the SOC pool between the plantation forest and shrubland. Furthermore, the relative changes in the SOC and POC densities increased with increasing mean annual temperature in the plantation forest and shrubland. Our results showed that both vegetation restoration strategies, characterized by higher soil microbial abundance and exchangeable Ca concentration, were beneficial to POC but not MOC accumulation, and sufficiently compensated SOC decomposition at lower elevation with higher MAT. Our results highlight the potential of both vegetation restoration strategies for promoting SOC accumulation in warmer karst regions and emphasize the necessity to understand soil carbon stabilization mechanisms in calcareous soils.","We thank Dr. Kongcao Xiao, Dr. Yunpeng Nie, Dr. Zhiyong Fu, Dr. Wanxia Peng, Dr. Xingyu Ma, Dr. Jun Zhang, Mr. Chunheng Zhou, and Miss Ming Cheng for assistance with field data collection.

However, the role of soil fauna on litter decomposition is poorly understood, despite the fact that it could strongly influence decomposition by fragmentation and subsequent modification of the activities of microorganisms.In this study, we carried out a meta-analysis on the effects of soil fauna on litter decomposition rates in Chinese forests, ranging from boreal to tropical forests, based on data from 20 studies. The effects of climatic factors on decomposition rate were assessed by comparing the contribution of soil fauna to litter decomposition from studies carried out at different latitudes.The degree of influence of the soil fauna was in the order tropical (200%) > subtropical (47%) > temperate forest (28%). Comparing the effect size of soil fauna, it was found that when soil fauna was excluded, the decomposition rate, calculated using Olson's equation, was most affected in tropical forest (-0.77), while the litter decomposition rate both subtropical (-0.36) and temperate forest (-0.19) were also suppressed to varying degrees (P < 0.001). These results highlight that soil fauna could promote litter decomposition to different extents. Using stepwise multiple linear regression, the effect size of the soil fauna was negatively correlated with the cellulose and nitrogen concentrations of the initial litter material. In Chinese forests, litter decomposition rates were reduced, on average, by 65% when soil fauna was excluded. The impact of soil fauna on decomposition was shown to be closely related to climate and litter quality.","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities (2572017AA21), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFA0600800), and Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (ZDBS-LY-DQC019).

This paper reviews the most widely used process-based models for simulating peatlands' dynamics, i.e., the exchanges of energy and mass (water, carbon, and nitrogen). 'Peatlands' here refers to mires, fens, bogs, and peat swamps both intact and degraded. Using a systematic search (involving 4900 articles), 45 models were selected that appeared at least twice in the literature. The models were classified into four categories: terrestrial ecosystem models (biogeochemical and global dynamic vegetation models, n = 21), hydrological models (n = 14), land surface models (n = 7), and eco-hydrological models (n = 3), 18 of which featured ""peatland-specific"" modules. By analysing their corresponding publications (n = 231), we identified their proven applicability domains (hydrology and carbon cycles dominated) for different peatland types and climate zones (northern bogs and fens dominated). The studies range in scale from small plots to global, and from single events to millennia. Following a FOSS (Free Open-Source Software) and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) assessment, the number of models was reduced to 12. Then, we conducted a technical review of the approaches and associated challenges, as well as the basic aspects of each model, e.g., spatiotemporal resolution, input/output data format and modularity. Our review streamlines the process of model selection and highlights: (i) standardization and coordination are required for both data exchange and model calibration/validation to facilitate intercomparison studies; and (ii) there are overlaps in the models' scopes and approaches, making it imperative to fully optimize the strengths of existing models rather than creating redundant ones. In this regard, we provide a futuristic outlook for a 'peatland community modelling platform' and suggest an international peatland modelling intercomparison project.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Several methods for wastewater treatment have been introduced, but biological denitrification has been recommended, particularly with addition of the best external carbon source. The key sites of denitrification are wetlands; it can be carried out with different methods. To highlight the aforementioned technology, this paper deals to review the literature to evaluate biological denitrification and to demonstrate cost effective external carbon sources. The results of systematic review disclose the denitrification process and addition of different external carbon sources. The online literature exploration was accomplished using the most well-known databases, that is, science direct and the web of science database, resulting 625 review articles and 3084 research articles, published in peer-reviewed journals between 2015 and 2021 were identified in first process. After doing an in-depth literature survey and exclusion criteria, we started to shape the review from selected review and research articles. A number of studies confirmed that both nitrification and denitrification are significant for biological treatment of wastewater. The studies proved that the carbon source is the main contributor and is a booster for the denitrification. Based on the literature reviewed it is concluded that biological denitrification with addition of external carbon source is cost effective and best option in nitrogen mitigation in a changing world. Our study recommends textile waste for recovery of carbon source.","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This study is supported by China PostDoc organization and Donghua University, Shanghai, China.

Its removal and pyrolytic conversion to biochar is seen as an opportunity to reduce terrestrial CO2 emissions and mitigate climate change. The mitigation effect of biochar is, however, ultimately dependent on the availability of the biomass feedstock, thus CO2 removal of biochar needs to be assessed in relation to the capacity to supply biochar systems with biomass feedstocks over prolonged time scales, relevant for climate mitigation. In the present study we used an assembly of empirical models to forecast the effects of harvest residue removal on soil C storage and the technical capacity of biochar to mitigate national-scale emissions over the century, using Norway as a case study for boreal conditions. We estimate the mitigation potential to vary between 0.41 and 0.78 Tg CO2 equivalents yr-1, of which 79% could be attributed to increased soil C stock, and 21% to the coproduction of bioenergy. These values correspond to 9-17% of the emissions of the Norwegian agricultural sector and to 0.8-1.5% of the total national emission. This illustrates that deployment of biochar from forest harvest residues in countries with a large forestry sector, relative to economy and population size, is likely to have a relatively small contribution to national emission reduction targets but may have a large effect on agricultural emission and commitments. Strategies for biochar deployment need to consider that biochar's mitigation effect is limited by the feedstock supply which needs to be critically assessed.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Soil microbial diversity and organic C are often tightly coupled in C cycling processes; however, this coupling can be weakened or broken by rapid global change. A global meta-analysis was performed with 1148 paired comparisons extracted from 229 articles published between January 1998 and December 2021 to determine how nitrogen (N) fertilization affects the relationship between soil C content and microbial diversity in terrestrial ecosystems. We found that N fertilization decreased soil bacterial (-11%) and fungal diversity (-17%), but increased soil organic C (SOC) (+19%), microbial biomass C (MBC) (+17%), and dissolved organic C (DOC) (+25%) across different ecosystems. Organic N (urea) fertilization had a greater effect on SOC, MBC, DOC, and bacterial and fungal diversity than inorganic N fertilization. Most importantly, soil microbial diversity decreased with increasing SOC, MBC, and DOC, and the absolute values of the correlation coefficients decreased with increasing N fertilization rate and duration, suggesting that N fertilization weakened the linkage between soil C and microbial diversity. The weakened linkage might negatively impact essential ecosystem services under high rates of N fertilization; this understanding is important for mitigating the negative impact of global N enrichment on soil C cycling.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was funded by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Science (No. XDB40020203), the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (42107282), the Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province (2021JM‐213), the Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology (SKLLQG1915), the Western light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XAB2019B11).

This could be particularly important in a context on changing rainfall patterns due to climate change. A lysimeter experiment with maize (Zea mays L.) was set up on a coarse sandy soil to evaluate the efficacy of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, nitrate (NO3-) leaching losses and net global warming potential from manure, with (R+) and without (R-) simulated rainfall events. Soil water availability was a limiting factor for plant growth and microbial processes due to low rainfall during the growing season. Nitrification was effectively inhibited by DMPP, decreasing topsoil NO3- concentrations by 28% on average and cumulative N2O losses by 82%. Most of the N2O was emitted during the growing season, with annual emission factors of 0.07% and 0.95% for manure with and without DMPP, respectively. Cumulative N2O emissions were 40% higher in R-compared to R+, possibly because of the higher topsoil NO3- concentrations. There was no effect of DMPP or rainfall amount on annual NO3- leaching losses, which corresponded to 12% of manure-N and were mainly driven by the post-harvest period. DMPP did not affect yield or N use efficiency (NUE) while R-caused severe reductions on biomass and NUE. We conclude that dry growing seasons can jeopardize crop production while concurrently increasing greenhouse gas emissions from a sandy soil. The use of nitrification inhibitors is strongly recommended under these conditions to address the climate change impacts.","Diego Abalos thanks financial support by the Danish Council for Independent Research via the projects No. 9041-00324B and No. 1051-00060B.

This review used a meta-analysis to assess effect sizes of eCO2 on both efflux rates and total amounts of some specific root exudates, and dissected whether eCO2 enhances plant's resistance to nutrient deficiency and ion toxicity via root exudates. Elevated CO2 did not affect efflux rates of total dissolved organic carbon, a measure of combined root exudates per unit of root biomass or length, but increased the efflux amount of root systems per plant by 31% which is likely attributed to increased root biomass (29%). Elevated CO2 increased efflux rates of soluble-sugars, carboxylates, and citrate by 47%, 111%, and 16%, respectively, but did not affect those of amino acids and malate. The increased carbon allocation to roots, increased plant requirements of mineral nutrients, and heightened detoxification responses to toxic ions under eCO2 collectively contribute to the increased efflux rates despite lacking molecular evidence. The increased efflux rates of root exudates under eCO2 were closely associated with improved nutrient uptake whilst less studies have validated the associations between root exudates and resistance to toxic ions of plants when grown under eCO2. Future studies are required to reveal how climate change (eCO2) affect the efflux of specific root exudates, particularly organic anions, the corresponding nutrient uptake and toxic ion resistance from plant molecular biology and soil microbial ecology perspectives.","The first author received PhD scholarships from La Trobe University and the financial support from Shanghai Agriculture Applied Technology Development Program, China (2019-02-08-00-15-F01142) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFD1100103).

According to the results of 51 articles included among 958 retrieved studies, the concentrations of the PTEs were as follows: Cd ≈As (0.110 mg/kg) > Pb (0.086 mg/kg) in cottonseed, canola, and olive oil and Fe (12.964 mg/kg) > Zn (1.044 mg/kg) > Ni (0.893 mg/kg) > Cu (0.264 mg/kg) in cottonseed, olive, and soybean for trace elementals, respectively. Based on the continent type, the higher concentration of Cd, As, and Pb was related to PAHO (American region) and AFRO (African region), and the higher concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, and Ni were observed in WPRO (Western Pacific Region), EMRO (Eastern Mediterranean Region), and AFRO. On the other hand, non-carcinogenic health risk assessment of the PTEs indicated that there was a different risk pattern in various countries, and the TTHQ level in adult groups was lower than 1. It can be concluded that the consumption of vegetable oils is safe and does not pose risk to the health of consumers.","The authors appreciate the Deputy of Research and Technology, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences for their financial support in this research.",,Biological Trace Element Research,,,"Environmental Monitoring; Metals, Heavy; Plant Oils; Risk Assessment; Soil Pollutants",2021-02-27,2021,2021-02-27,2022-01,200,1,437-446,Closed,Article,"Ghane, Elaheh Talebi; Poormohammadi, Ali; Khazaei, Salman; Mehri, Fereshteh","Ghane, Elaheh Talebi (Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran); Poormohammadi, Ali (Center of Excellence for Occupational Health, Research Center for Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran); Khazaei, Salman (Research Center for Health Sciences, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran); Mehri, Fereshteh (Nutrition Health Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran)","Mehri, Fereshteh (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences)","Ghane, Elaheh Talebi (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences); Poormohammadi, Ali (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences); Khazaei, Salman (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences); Mehri, Fereshteh (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences)",23,21,6.57,8.1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135801627,31 Biological Sciences; 3102 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,

The ability of biochar to mediate and support microbial degradation of contaminants, combined with its carbon-sequestration potential, has attracted attention in recent years. Biochar is a possible candidate for use in cost-effective and sustainable biological water treatment, especially in agrarian economies with easy access to abundant biomass in the form of crop residues and organic wastes. This review evaluates the scope, potential benefits (economic and environmental) and challenges of sustainable biological water treatment using 'Biologically-Enhanced Biochar' or BEB. We discuss the various processes occurring in BEB systems and demonstrate the urgent need to investigate microbial degradation mechanisms. We highlight the need to correlate biochar properties to biofilm development, which can eventually determine process efficiency. We also demonstrate the various opportunities in adopting BEB as a cheaper and more viable alternative in Low and Middle Income Countries and compare it to the current benchmark, 'Biological Activated Carbon'. We focus on the recent advances in the areas of data science, mathematical modelling and molecular biology to systematically and sustainably design BEB filters, unlike the largely empirical design approaches seen in water treatment. 'Sequential biochar systems' are introduced as specially designed end-of-life techniques to lower the environmental impact of BEB filters and examples of their integration into biological water treatment that can fulfil zero waste criteria for BEBs are given.",This work was supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Grant (BB/S011579/1).

A global meta-analysis,"Organic amendments (animal manure and biochar) to agricultural soils may enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) contents, improve soil fertility and crop productivity but also contribute to global warming through nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. However, the effects of organic amendments on N2O emissions from agricultural soils seem variable among numerous research studies and remains uncertain. Here, eighty-five publications (peer-reviewed) were selected to perform a meta-analysis study. The results of this meta-analysis study show that the application of animal manure enhanced N2O emissions by 17.7%, whereas, biochar amendment significantly mitigated N2O emissions by 19.7%. Moreover, coarse textured soils increased [lnRR‾ = 182.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 151.4%, 217.7%] N2O emission after animal manure, in contrast, N2O emission mitigated by 7.0% from coarse textured soils after biochar amendment. In addition, this study found that 121-320 kg N ha-1 and ⩽ 30 T ha-1 application rates of animal manure and biochar mitigated N2O emissions by 72.3% and 22.5%, respectively. Soil pH also played a vital role in regulating the N2O emissions after organic amendments. Furthermore, > 10 soil C: N ratios increased N2O emissions by 121.4% and 27.6% after animal and biochar amendments, respectively. Overall, animal manure C: N ratios significantly enhanced N2O emissions, while, biochar C: N ratio had not shown any effect on N2O emissions. Overall, average N2O emission factors (EFs) for animal manure and biochar amendments were 0.46% and -0.08%, respectively. Thus, the results of this meta-analysis study provide scientific evidence about how organic amendments such as animal manure and biochar regulating the N2O emission from agricultural soils.","Awais Shakoor would like to express his gratitude for the grant provided by the University of Lleida, Spain.

Here, we conducted a field experiment in northeastern Inner Mongolia to test the effectiveness of sown pastures in lowering the grazing pressure on grasslands and raising the quality of marginal soils. Alfalfa and smooth bromegrass monocultures and mixture were sown in a marginal cropland field in Hulunber in June 2016. Biomass productivity, soil physicochemical, and biological properties were monitored annually from 2016 to 2020. The results showed that the marginal cropland soil responded consistently positively to sown pastures for major soil properties. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) increased by 48 and 21%, respectively, from 2016 to 2020 over the 0-60 cm soil depth range. Soil microbes responded proactively too. The soil microbial biomass C (SMBC) and N (SMBN) increased by 117 and 39%, respectively, during the period of 2016-2020. However, by the end of the experiment, the soil of a natural grassland field, which was included in the experiment as a control, led the sown pasture soil by 28% for SOC, 35% for TN, 66% for SMBC, and 96% for SMBN. Nevertheless, the natural grassland soil's productive capacity was inferior to that of the sown pasture soil. The average aboveground biomass productivity of sown pastures was measured at 8.4 Mg ha-1 in 2020, compared to 5.0 Mg ha-1 for natural grassland, while the root biomass of sown pastures was averaged at 7.5 Mg ha-1, leading the natural grassland by 15%. Our analyses also showed that the sown pastures' biomass productivity advantage had a much-neglected potential in natural grassland protection. If 50% of the available marginal cropland resources in Hulunber under the current environmental protection law were used for sown pastures, the livestock grazing pressure on the natural grasslands would decrease by a big margin of 38%. Overall, these results represent systematic empirical and analytical evidence of marginal cropland soil's positive responses to sown pastures, which shows clearly that sown pasture is a valid measure both for soil rehabilitation and biomass production.",,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number: 41703081), and the China Agriculture Research System (grant number: CARS-34).",Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2022-09-29,2022,2022-09-29,,13,,985864,All OA; Gold,Article,"Xu, Lijun; Li, Da; Wang, Di; Ye, Liming; Nie, Yingying; Fang, Huajun; Xue, Wei; Bai, Chunli; Van Ranst, Eric","Xu, Lijun (Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China); Li, Da (Department of Grassland Research, Baicheng Institute of Animal Husbandry, Baicheng, China); Wang, Di (Department of Grassland Research, Baicheng Institute of Animal Husbandry, Baicheng, China); Ye, Liming (Department of Geology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium); Nie, Yingying (Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China); Fang, Huajun (Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China); Xue, Wei (Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China); Bai, Chunli (Grassland Research Institute, Inner Mongolia Academy of Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Sciences, Hohhot, China); Van Ranst, Eric (Department of Geology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium)","Ye, Liming (Ghent University)","Xu, Lijun (Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning); Li, Da (); Wang, Di (); Ye, Liming (Ghent University); Nie, Yingying (Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning); Fang, Huajun (Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research); Xue, Wei (Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning); Bai, Chunli (Inner Mongolia Academy of Agricultural & Animal Husbandry Sciences); Van Ranst, Eric (Ghent University)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.985864/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151449628,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3007 Forestry Sciences",15 Life on Land

Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 3173 observations with 1444, 1334, 228, and 167 observations for soil C, N, pyrogenic C (PyC), and the percent of PyC to total organic C (PyC/TOC) from 296 field studies. Results showed that fire significantly decreased soil C (-15.2%) and N (-14.6%) but increased soil PyC (40.6%) and PyC/TOC (30.3%). Stronger negative fire impacts on soil C and N were found in tropical and temperate climates than in Mediterranean and subtropical climates; stronger effects were found in forest ecosystems than in non-forest ecosystems. Wildfire and high-severity fire led to greater soil C and N losses than prescribed and low-severity fires, respectively, while they promoted greater increases in soil PyC and PyC/TOC than prescribed and low-severity fires, respectively. However, soil C and N recovered to control levels approximately 10 years after fire, which is a shorter period than previously determined. These results suggest that fire-induced PyC production should be accounted for in the C budget under global change. These results will improve our knowledge of the spatiotemporal variability of fire effects on soil C and N storage and have implications for fire management and ecosystem recovery.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr. Mingkai Jiang for insightful comments during the manuscript preparation.

Interactions with soil microbes impact plant fitness, scaling up to influence plant populations and distributions. Here we present the first factorial manipulation of both fire and soil microbiome presence to investigate their interactive effects on plant performance across a suite of plant species with varying life history traits. We conducted fully factorial experiments on 11 species from the Florida scrub ecosystem to test plant performance responses to soils with varying fire histories (36 soil sources), the presence/absence of a microbiome, and exposure to an experimental burn. Results revealed interactive 'pulse' effects between fire and the soil microbiome on plant performance. On average, post-fire soil microbiomes strongly reduced plant productivity compared to unburned or sterilized soils. Interestingly, longer-term fire 'legacy' effects had minor impacts on plant performance and were unrelated to soil microbiomes. While pulse fire effects on plant-microbiome interactions are short-term, they could have long-term consequences for plant communities by establishing differential microbiome-mediated priority effects during post-disturbance succession. The prominence of pulse fire effects on plant-microbe interactions has even greater import due to expected increases in fire disturbances resulting from anthropogenic climate change.","This work was funded by an award to MEA and CAS from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) DEB‐1922521, and a research grant to DR from the Florida Native Plant Society.

However, the effects of different vegetation types on SOC priming and the underlying microbial mechanisms due to global warming are poorly understood. To elucidate these unknowns, the current study quantified soil priming effects using 13C-labeled maize residue amendments and analyzed the community structure and abundances in the soils of a vegetation succession gradient (maize field (MF), grassland (GL), and secondary forest (SF)) from a karst region under two incubation temperatures (15 °C and 25 °C). Results revealed that after 120 d of incubation, vegetation restoration increased the soil priming effects. Compared to MF, the priming effects of SF at 15 °C and 25 °C increased by 142.36 % and 161.09 %, respectively. This may be attributed to a high C/N ratio and low-N availability (NO3-), which supports the ""microbial nitrogen mining"" theory. Variations in soil priming were linked to changes in microbial properties. Moreover, with vegetation restoration, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria (copiotrophs) increased, while Ascomycota (oligotrophs) decreased, which accelerated native SOC decomposition. Co-occurrence network analysis indicated that the cooperative interactions of co-existing keystone taxa may facilitate SOC priming. Furthermore, structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated that changes in the priming effects were directly related to the fungal Shannon index and microbial biomass C (MBC), which were affected by soil C/N and NO3-. Warming significantly decreased soil priming, which may be attributed to the increase in microbial respiration (qCO2) and decreased MBC. The temperature sensitivity (Q10) of SOC mineralization was higher after residue amendment, but significant differences were not detected among the vegetation types. Collectively, our results indicated that the intensity of priming effects was dependent on vegetation type and temperature. Microbial community alterations and physicochemical interactions played important roles in SOC decomposition and sequestration.","This study was supported by Integrated Demonstration of Key Techniques for the Industrial Development of Featured Crops in Rocky Desertification Areas of Yunnan-Guangxi-Guizhou Provinces (SMH2019-2021), Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund for Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences (No. 1630042022003; 1630032022011), Youth science and technology fund project of Guizhou Academy of Agricultural Sciences (No. [2020]28).

The challenges of food production to meet the pace of population growth in an environmentally-sustainable manner have increased considerably, emphasizing the need to explore newer approaches to agriculture. Agrochemical-based agricultural practices are known to have serious environmental and health implications. Even conventional organic farming is not sustainable in the long run. Although some ""age-old"" practices are useful, these will not help feed more people on the same or less land more sustainably. Sustainable intensification is the way forward. There is a need to incorporate a customer-centric outlook and make the organic system sustainable. Here, we bring forth the necessity to enhance the efficiency of organic agriculture by the inclusion of robotics and agrochemical-free GM seeds. Such an organic-GM hybrid agriculture system integrated with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) based technologies will have better energy efficiency. The produce from such a system will offer consumers a 'third' choice and create a new food label, 'organically-grown GM produce'.","AMH is grateful to the members of Genome Engineering Sustainable Biotechnology Lab, Division of Plant Biotechnology, SKUAST-K for their support and cooperation.",The authors did not receive support from any organization for the submitted work.,Journal of Biotechnology,,,"Humans; Organic Agriculture; Artificial Intelligence; Agriculture; Biotechnology; Crops, Agricultural",2022-12-05,2022,2022-12-05,2023-01,361,,41-48,Closed,Article,"Husaini, Amjad M; Sohail, Muhammad","Husaini, Amjad M (Genome Engineering and Societal Biotechnology Lab, Division of Plant Biotechnology, Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Kashmir, Shalimar, Jammu and Kashmir, India.

However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how soil organic carbon (SOC) and aggregate stability respond to agricultural management across wide environmental gradients. Here, we assessed the impact of climatic factors, soil properties and agricultural management (including land use, crop cover, crop diversity, organic fertilization, and management intensity) on SOC and the mean weight diameter of soil aggregates, commonly used as an indicator for soil aggregate stability, across a 3000 km European gradient. Soil aggregate stability (-56%) and SOC stocks (-35%) in the topsoil (20 cm) were lower in croplands compared with neighboring grassland sites (uncropped sites with perennial vegetation and little or no external inputs). Land use and aridity were strong drivers of soil aggregation explaining 33% and 20% of the variation, respectively. SOC stocks were best explained by calcium content (20% of explained variation) followed by aridity (15%) and mean annual temperature (10%). We also found a threshold-like pattern for SOC stocks and aggregate stability in response to aridity, with lower values at sites with higher aridity. The impact of crop management on aggregate stability and SOC stocks appeared to be regulated by these thresholds, with more pronounced positive effects of crop diversity and more severe negative effects of crop management intensity in nondryland compared with dryland regions. We link the higher sensitivity of SOC stocks and aggregate stability in nondryland regions to a higher climatic potential for aggregate-mediated SOC stabilization. The presented findings are relevant for improving predictions of management effects on soil structure and C storage and highlight the need for site-specific agri-environmental policies to improve soil quality and C sequestration.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are thankful to all the farmers and farm managers for allowing us to sample their fields and for completing our detailed questionnaires.

Natural resources are the material basis, space carrier and energy source of high-quality development. The source of carbon emissions is resource utilization, and carbon reduction and removal also depend on resources. The improvement of carbon sink capacity is inseparable from natural resources. To achieve the goal of ""double carbon"", it is necessary to consolidate the carbon sink capacity of the ecosystem, as well as enhancing its carbon sink increment. Among natural resources, forest carbon sinks, soil carbon sinks and karst carbon sinks have significant emission reduction potential and cost advantages, representing important means to deal with climate change. This paper reviews the relevant research results at home and abroad, summarizes the carbon sink estimation, carbon sink potential, carbon sink influencing factors, ecological compensation mechanism and other aspects, analyzes the path selection of establishing carbon sink green development, and puts forward corresponding policies and suggestions, providing a theoretical reference for the achievement of the carbon neutrality goal in the field of natural resources in China.",,This research was supported by the Science and Technology Support Plan of Guizhou Province (Qian (2017)1410); the High-Level Talent Introduction Program for the Guizhou Institute of Technology (0203001018040).

Although several sediment tests have been standardized, experimental factors such as spiking methods still vary between laboratories. To identify the experimental factors that affect the bioavailability of contaminants and account for the highest percentage of the variability of toxicity values (i.e., 50% lethal concentration; LC50), we performed a meta-analysis of published 10-14-day spiked-sediment toxicity tests with the standard test species Hyalella azteca and Chironomus dilutus. Analysis of 172 test records revealed that the variability of sediment LC50s for a given combination of chemical and test species was large. The mean coefficient of variation (CV) was 65%, even after organic carbon normalization, and was slightly larger than the CV in water-only tests (49%). Regression analyses revealed that the most important factor contributing to the variability of the sediment LC50s was sediment type (i.e., environmental or formulated sediment) and that use of formulated sediment (i.e., composed of peat, cellulose, or leaves as organic carbon source) tended to cause higher toxicity than use of environmental sediment. This might be caused by the difference in partitioning the coefficient of organic contaminants and the resulting difference in the bioavailability between sediment types. The effects of other factors, including aging periods and spiking methods, were insignificant or specific to certain chemicals. These discoveries facilitate refinement of the methodologies used in sediment toxicity testing and the correct interpretation of test results.

It involves the thermochemical decomposition of biomass waste under anoxic conditions, which can reduce the cost of disposal and produce biochar with beneficial properties. Herein, this study aimed to investigate the properties and environmental applications of biochar from single- and mixed- feedstocks of wheat straw, rice husk, pig manure, and oyster shell at 450 ℃, respectively. A pot experiment with Chinese cabbage was carried out to compare the effects of biochars with limestone on soil Cd and Pb immobilization at two harvest periods. The results indicated that co-pyrolysis of various biomasses exhibited synthetic effects on promoting the calorific value of syngas and enhancing the quality of produced biochar. The pot experiment revealed a significant promotion on soil pH, soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity, and soluble Ca, which consequently reduced Cd and Pb availability. In contrast with limestone treatment, soil amendment with single biomass-derived and co-pyrolysis-derived (COPB) biochars had a significant positive impact on soil fertility and microbial biomass. Application of COPB at a 0.5% dosage consistently and most effectively enhanced the shoot biomass, increased leaf Vitamin C content but reduced leaf content of nitrate and heavy metals in both harvests. Using COPB for soil remediation would be financially visible due to the enhancement of crop yield. Therefore, this study proposes a strategy for targeted enhancement of the functions of biochar derived from co-pyrolysis of selected biomass waste for soil remediation and agricultural production.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Meanwhile, sewage sludge is rich in pollutant-degrading microorganisms and nutrients, drawing our attention to investigate their potential to be used as a supplement for bioremediation of PCBs. Here we reported extensive microbial reductive dechlorination of PCBs by waste activated sludge (WAS) and digestion sludge (DS), which were identified to harbor multiple putative organohalide-respiring bacteria (i.e., Dehalococcoides, Dehalogenimonas, Dehalobacter, and uncultivated Dehalococcoidia) and PCB reductive dehalogenase genes (i.e., pcbA4 and pcbA5). Consequently, amendment of 1-20% (w/w) fresh WAS/DS enhanced the attenuation of PCBs by 126-544% in a soil microcosm compared with the control soil, with the fastest dechlorination of PCBs being achieved when spiked with 20% fresh WAS. Notably, dechlorination pathways of PCBs were also changed by sludge amendment. Microbial and physicochemical analyses revealed that the enhanced dechlorination of PCBs by sludge amendment was largely attributed to the synergistic effects of sludge-derived nutrients, PCB-dechlorinating bacteria, and stimulated growth of beneficial microorganisms (e.g., fermenters). Finally, risk assessment of heavy metals suggests low potential ecological risks of sludge amendment in soil. Collectively, our study demonstrates that sewage sludge amendment could be an efficient, cost-effective and environment-friendly approach for in situ bioremediation of PCBs.","This study was supported by the Ministry of Education, Singapore under Academic Research Fund Tier 2 under project No.: MOE-000033-01 and Tier 1 under Project No.: R-302-000-239-114.",,Journal of Hazardous Materials,,,"Acceleration; Biodegradation, Environmental; Chloroflexi; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Sewage; Soil",2021-07-13,2021,2021-07-13,2021-10,420,,126630,Closed,Article,"Xu, Guofang; Zhao, Xuejie; Zhao, Siyan; He, Jianzhong","Xu, Guofang (NUS Graduate School - Integrative Sciences and Engineering Programme (ISEP), National University of Singapore, Singapore 119077, Singapore; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore, Block E2-02-13, 1 Engineering Drive 3, Singapore 117576, Singapore.); Zhao, Xuejie (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore, Block E2-02-13, 1 Engineering Drive 3, Singapore 117576, Singapore.); Zhao, Siyan (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore, Block E2-02-13, 1 Engineering Drive 3, Singapore 117576, Singapore.); He, Jianzhong (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore, Block E2-02-13, 1 Engineering Drive 3, Singapore 117576, Singapore.

Yet, the direct and indirect mechanisms which underpin these changes remain poorly understood at the ecosystem level. Here, using structural equation modelling across a 150+ year chronosequence, we disentangle the direct and indirect effects of major disturbances in a temperate forest ecosystem. We show that wildfires, logging and post-fire (salvage) logging can affect plant and microbial communities and abiotic soil properties both directly and indirectly through plant-soil-microbial interactions. We quantified 68 direct and indirect disturbance effects across these components, with the majority resulting in ecosystem-wide adverse effects. Indirect disturbance effects accounted for 43% of total disturbance effects, with some amplifying or partially mitigating direct disturbance effects. Overall, human disturbances were associated with more negative effects than natural disturbances. Our analyses provide novel insights into the multifaceted dynamics of forest disturbances and the mechanisms which underpin their relative impacts.","We thank the Mycological Society of America, The Paddy Pallin Foundation, The Ecological Society of Australia&#x27;s: Holsworth Wildlife Fund, the Centre of Biodiversity Analysis and volunteers who assisted in data collection for their support and contributions to this study.

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify Cd and Pb concentrations in plant shoots and roots in response to biochar application and soil properties. We collected data from 65 peer-reviewed journal articles published from 2009 to 2020 in which 66% of manuscripts were published from 2015 to 2020. The data were processed using OpenMEE software. The results pinpointed that addition of biochar to soil caused a significant decrease in shoot and root Cd and Pb concentrations as compared to untreated soils with biochar (control), and the reduction rate was affected by plant types and both biochar and soil properties. The biochar size less than 2 mm, biochar pH higher than 10, pyrolysis temperature of 401-600 °C, and the application rate higher than 2% appeared to be effective in reducing shoot and root Cd and Pb concentration. Soil properties such as pH, SOC, and texture influenced the efficiency of biochar for reducing plant Cd and Pb uptake. Biochar application increased SOC (54.3%), CEC (48.0%), pH (0.08), and EC (59.4%), and reduced soil extractable Cd (42.1%) and Pb (47.1%) concentration in comparison to control. A detailed study on the rhizosphere chemistry and uptake mechanism will help to underpin the biochar application rates and their efficiency reducing PTE mobility and plant uptake.","This work was supported by the Special fund for scientific innovation strategy- construction of high level, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Science, China (BZ201903, R2016PY-JX006, R2016PY-QY010);

Self-irrigating boxes containing the soil and amendment combinations were purposed with a battery of soil moisture sensors as well as soil porewater sampling devices. Static sampling determined bulk density, porosity and derived soil water retention curves. The aim of this study was to identify the most advantageous amendment combinations to enhance soil water retention whilst simultaneously avoiding excessive nutrient leaching arising, primarily, from manure application. Biochar significantly decreased bulk density and increased total porosity when compared to compost in the Fluvisol, whereas manure affected the greatest changes in the Regosol. All of the tested amendments adjusted the shape or extent of the soil water retention curves, but biochar addition resulted in the greatest increase (⁓50%) in easily available water content (for plants) in both soils, when compared to the control. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was, however, not changed by any of the amendments which reflects a lack of influence on infiltration. An enhancement in nutrient retention occurred in some of the soil amendment configurations, such as for co-composted biochar at 2% dosage and 5% manure-biochar mixture, as revealed by porewater analysis. In summary, the application of biochar with and without additional compost and manure can enhance soil water retention in low-organic soils whilst maintaining or enhancing nutrient retention. Such finding supports the application of mixed organic amendments to low-organic (and therefore drought-prone) arable soils.","This research was supported by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic (project QK1910056); Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (projects LTE119008 and CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008403); and Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Environmental Sciences, CZU Prague (project 2020B0003).",,Chemosphere,,,Charcoal; Composting; Manure; Nutrients; Soil; Water,2022-01-12,2022,2022-01-12,2022-04,293,,133586,Closed,Article,"Seyedsadr, Samar; Šípek, Václav; Jačka, Lukáš; Sněhota, Michal; Beesley, Luke; Pohořelý, Michael; Kovář, Martin; Trakal, Lukáš","Seyedsadr, Samar (Department of Environmental Geosciences, Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Kamýcká 129, 16500, Praha 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.); Šípek, Václav (Department of Water Resources, Institute of Hydrodynamics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Pod Paťankou 30/5, 16612, Praha 6, Czech Republic.); Jačka, Lukáš (Department of Water Resources and Environmental Modeling, Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Kamýcká 129, Praha 6, Suchdol, 165 00, Czech Republic.); Sněhota, Michal (Faculty of Civil Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Thákurova 7, Prague 6, 166 29, Prague, Czech Republic.); Beesley, Luke (The James Hutton Institute, Craigiebuckler, Aberdeen, AB15 8QH, UK.); Pohořelý, Michael (Environmental Process Engineering Laboratory, Institute of Chemical Process Fundamentals, Academy of Sciences of Czech Republic, v. v. i., Rozvojová 135, Praha 6, Suchdol, 165 02, Czech Republic; Department of Power Engineering, University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague, Technická 5, 166 28, Praha 6, Czech Republic.); Kovář, Martin (Department of Water Resources and Environmental Modeling, Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Kamýcká 129, Praha 6, Suchdol, 165 00, Czech Republic.); Trakal, Lukáš (Department of Environmental Geosciences, Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Kamýcká 129, 16500, Praha 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.

One of the remarked examples is the potential contribution of BVOCs released by urban plants to the generation of ground-level ozone and SOA. The choice of urban plant species, therefore, is critical for air quality improvement in cities. Understanding the rates of BVOCs emitted from different urban plants and how they change in response to environmental stressors is a prerequisite to making the right decision on plant species selection. Here, we performed a meta-analysis on the selected 159 studies that include 357 species to address this need. We found: (1) 89% of deciduous trees emit the three major types of BVOCs, isoprene, monoterpene, and sesquiterpene, but only do 53% evergreen ones. (2) The main types of BVOCs emission by broad-leaved and coniferous plants differ. Seventy-eight percent of broad-leaved, but only 48% of coniferous trees emit isoprene, whereas 74% of broad-leaved, but 93% of coniferous plants emit monoterpene. (3) The emission rates of isoprene and monoterpene differ significantly among species. (4) The analysis on the 77 species collected in previous studies indicated that the effect of environmental stressors varies by different compounds, and the combined effect is not precisely the same as that of a single factor. Based on the meta-analysis, we further identified a few key knowledge gaps and research priorities. First, more studies on the BVOCs emission and carbon allocation at the tree species level are needed. Second, the combined effects of multiple environmental stresses, especially long-term ones, on BVOC emissions and the mechanisms warrant further research. Third, it is vital to evaluate BVOC-climate interactions on global change. Furthermore, there is little empirical work on the synergies and tradeoffs between BVOC emissions and ecosystem services provision of urban plants, which warrants future investigation.",This work is supported by funding from the National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U21A2010); the National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42225104); the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (Grant No. 2022YFF1301100); the Strategic Priority Research Program (A) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA23030102).,,Environmental Pollution,,,Volatile Organic Compounds; Ecosystem; Air Pollutants; Plants; Trees; Monoterpenes,2022-12-19,2022,2022-12-19,2023-02,318,,120886,Closed,Article,"Bao, Xinxin; Zhou, Weiqi; Xu, Linli; Zheng, Zhong","Bao, Xinxin (School of Life Sciences, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, China; State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China.); Zhou, Weiqi (State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Megaregion National Observation and Research Station for Eco-Environmental Change, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China; Xiongan Institute of Innovation, Xiongan New Area, 071000, China.

Site-specific best management practices (BMPs) are being promoted for adoption globally as solutions. However, how SOC and crop yield are related to each other in responding to BMPs remains unknown. Here, path analysis based on meta-analysis and machine learning was conducted to identify the effects and potential mechanisms of how the relationship between SOC and crop yield responds to site-specific BMPs in China. The results showed that BMPs could significantly enhance SOC and maintain or increase crop yield. The maximum benefits in SOC (30.6%) and crop yield (79.8%) occurred in mineral fertilizer combined with organic inputs (MOF). Specifically, the optimal SOC and crop yield would be achieved when the areas were arid, soil pH was ≥7.3, initial SOC content was ≤10 g kg-1 , duration was >10 years, and the nitrogen (N) input level was 100-200 kg ha-1 . Further analysis revealed that the original SOC level and crop yield change showed an inverted V-shaped structure. The association between the changes in SOC and crop yield might be linked to the positive role of the nutrient-mediated effect. The results generally suggested that improving the SOC can strongly support better crop performance. Limitations in increasing crop yield still exist due to low original SOC level, and in regions where the excessive N inputs, inappropriate tillage or organic input is inadequate and could be diminished by optimizing BMPs in harmony with site-specific conditions.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by the Intergovernmental International Cooperation on Scientific and Technological Innovation as Part of National Key R&amp;D Programs (2021YFE0114500) and the China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA (CARS‐12).

However, rather than being ""opaque"", the placenta is translucent or even transparent to some potential fetal developmental hazards, including toxic trace elements (TEs), perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and environmental phenols (EPs) to which women with pregnancy are frequently exposed. These agents are both passively and actively transferred to the fetal compartment, where endocrine disruption, oxidative stress, and epigenetic changes may occur. These pathologies may directly impact the fetus or deposit and accumulate in the placenta to indirectly impact fetal development. Thus, it is critical for clinicians to understand the potential placental toxicity and transfer of widely distributed environmental agents ubiquitous during pregnancy.

Because of the associated practices, the flows of several environmental pollutants into the organic products threaten food safety and human health. The contaminants that occur at higher concentrations in organic produce include persistent organic pollutants (61.3-436.9 ng g-1 lamb meat, and 0.28 pg g-1-2.75 ng g-1 bovine meat), heavy metals (0.5-33.0 mg kg-1 lettuce), organochlorine pesticides (11-199 μg g-1 carrots), cyclodienes, hexachlorocyclohexanes, hexabromocyclododecane (2-3 times higher than in conventionally produced porcine meat), hexachlorobenzene (1.38-14.49 ng g-1 fat in milk), and non-brominated flame retardants (1.3-3.2 times higher than in conventional produce of greenhouse-grown tomato and cucumber). Moreover, some pollutants like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances with a longer half-life (1.50-9.10 yrs) are reported to occur in several organic products. In fact, several legacy persistent organic pollutants are known for their significant trophic magnification in an urban terrestrial ecosystem. In addition, many plant functionalities are adversely affected in organic farming. Therefore, the long-term usage of organic products containing such pollutants poses a significant threat to human health. The major limitation in organic livestock production is the severe shortage of organic feed. Several variable standards and technical regulations set by the government and private agencies are the major obstacles in the global marketing of organic products. The present review critically addresses the impact of organic farming on hidden risks due to the use of composts as the amendment resources that enhance the phytoaccumulation and trophic transfer of pollutants, the functional diversity of the ecosystems, and poor harmonization among the policies and regulations in different countries for organic farming. The future directions of research have been suggested to mitigate unintended flows of pollutants into the organic products.","NRM acknowledges the Universidad Técnica de Manabí, Portoviejo, Ecuador, for financial assistance (No. PYT1184-CONV2019-FCS0035).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Animals; Cattle; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Flame Retardants; Food Safety; Humans; Organic Agriculture; Swine,2021-01-09,2021,2021-01-09,2021-05,769,,145079,Closed,Article,"Ramakrishnan, Balasubramanian; Maddela, Naga Raju; Venkateswarlu, Kadiyala; Megharaj, Mallavarapu","Ramakrishnan, Balasubramanian (Division of Microbiology, ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi 110012, India.); Maddela, Naga Raju (Departamento de Ciencias Biológicas, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Técnica de Manabí, Portoviejo 130105, Ecuador.); Venkateswarlu, Kadiyala (Formerly Department of Microbiology, Sri Krishnadevaraya University, Anantapuramu 515003, India.); Megharaj, Mallavarapu (Global Centre for Environmental Remediation (GCER), Cooperative Research Centre for Contamination Assessment and Remediation of the Environment (CRC CARE), Faculty of Science, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.

In the last century glaciers across most of the cryosphere have receded at an unprecedented pace. Many studies have been published from different parts of the world testing hypotheses about how soil ecosystems are responding to rapid, contemporary deglaciation events. To better understand and draw general conclusions about how soil ecosystems respond to deglaciation, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 95 published articles focused on the succession of various organisms and soil physicochemical properties in glacier forefields along the chronosequence. Our global synthesis reveals that key soil properties and the abundance and richness of biota follow two conspicuous patterns: (1) some taxa demonstrate a persistent increase in abundance and richness over the entire chronosequence, (2) other taxa increase in abundance and richness during the first 50 years of succession, then gradually decline 50 years onward. The soil properties and soil organisms that are intimately tied to vegetation follow the first pattern, consistent with the idea that aboveground patterns of vegetation can drive patterns of belowground biodiversity. The second pattern may be due to an initial increase and subsequent decline in available nutrients and habitat suitability caused by increased biotic interactions, including resource competition among soil biota. A consensus view of the patterns of historical and contemporary soil ecosystem responses to deglaciation provides a better understanding of the processes that generate these patterns and informs predictions of ongoing and future responses to environmental changes.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This project was supported by National Science Foundation Grant #OPP‐1637708 for Long Term Ecological Research.

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how above- and belowground detrital inputs affect soil C and N in mountain forests in an arid land. Here, we explored the effects of litter and root manipulations (control (CK), doubled litter input (DL), removal of litter (NL), root exclusion (NR), and a combination of litter removal and root exclusion (NI)) on soil C and N concentrations, enzyme activity and microbial biomass during a 2-year field experiment. We found that DL had no significant effect on soil total organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) but significantly increased soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass C, N and inorganic N as well as soil cellulase, phosphatase and peroxidase activities. Conversely, NL and NR reduced soil C and N concentrations and enzyme activities. We also found an increase in the biomass of soil bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes in the DL treatment, while NL reduced the biomass of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and fungi by 5.15%, 17.50% and 14.17%, respectively. The NR decreased the biomass of these three taxonomic groups by 8.97%, 22.11% and 21.36%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that soil biotic factors (enzyme activity and microbial biomass) and abiotic factors (soil moisture content) significantly controlled the change in soil C and N concentrations (P < 0.01). In brief, we found that the short-term input of plant detritus could markedly affect the concentrations and biological characteristics of the C and N fractions in soil. The removal experiment indicated that the contribution of roots to soil nutrients is greater than that of the litter.","This research was supported by the Key Laboratory Open Topic of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (2019D04001), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31760142) and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Graduate Research and Innovation Project (XJ2020G010).

They play a key role in plant lifespan via direct and indirect plant defenses, attracting pollinators, and mediating various interactions between plants and their environment. The ecological diversity and context-dependence of plant-plant communication driven by volatiles are crucial elements that influence plant performance in different habitats. Plant volatiles are also valued for their multiple applications in food, flavor, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics industries. In the current review, we summarize recent advances that have elucidated the functions of plant volatile organic compounds as mediators of plant interaction at community and individual levels, highlighting the complexities of plant receiver feedback to various signals and cues. This review emphasizes volatile terpenoids, the most abundant class of plant volatile organic compounds, highlighting their role in plant adaptability to global climate change and stress-response pathways that are integral to plant growth and survival. Finally, we identify research gaps and suggest future research directions.","This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (2018YFD1000200), the Guangzhou Science and Technology Project (202103000057 and 202206010023), Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department Local Universities Joint Project (202101BA070001‐166), Talent Introduction Project of Kunming University (XJ20220003), and Science and Technology Project of Yunnan Provincial Education Department (2021J0716).","Funding information China Litchi and Longan Industry Technology Research System, Grant/Award Number: CARS‐32‐08; Guangzhou Science and Technology Project, Grant/Award Numbers: 202103000057, 202206010023; Science and Technology Project of Yunnan Provincial Education Department, Grant/Award Number: 2021J0716; National Key Research and Development Program, Grant/Award Number: 2018YFD1000200; Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department Local Universities Joint Project, Grant/Award Number: 202101BA070001‐166; Talent Introduction Project of Kunming University, Grant/Award Number: XJ20220003",Physiologia Plantarum,,,Volatile Organic Compounds; Climate Change; Plants; Acclimatization,2022-11,2022,2022-12-26,2022-11,174,6,e13840,Closed,Article,"Abbas, Farhat; Rothenberg, Dylan O'Neill; Zhou, Yiwei; Ke, Yanguo; Wang, Hui‐Cong","Abbas, Farhat (Key Laboratory of Biology and Genetic Improvement of Horticultural Crops‐South China/Guangdong Litchi Engineering Research Center, College of Horticulture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China); Rothenberg, Dylan O'Neill (Key Laboratory of Biology and Genetic Improvement of Horticultural Crops‐South China/Guangdong Litchi Engineering Research Center, College of Horticulture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China); Zhou, Yiwei (Guangdong Key Laboratory of Ornamental Plant Germplasm Innovation and Utilization, Environmental Horticulture Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou, China); Ke, Yanguo (College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Yunnan Urban Agricultural Engineering & Technological Research Center, Kunming University, Kunming, China; College of Economics and Management, Kunming University, Kunming, China); Wang, Hui‐Cong (Key Laboratory of Biology and Genetic Improvement of Horticultural Crops‐South China/Guangdong Litchi Engineering Research Center, College of Horticulture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China)","Ke, Yanguo (Kunming University; Kunming University); Wang, Hui‐Cong (South China Agricultural University)","Abbas, Farhat (South China Agricultural University); Rothenberg, Dylan O'Neill (South China Agricultural University); Zhou, Yiwei (Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences); Ke, Yanguo (Kunming University; Kunming University); Wang, Hui‐Cong (South China Agricultural University)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153600626,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,13 Climate Action

A healthy soil ecosystem is supported by favorable components in the soil that promote biological productivity and provide ecosystem services. Bio-indicators of soil health are measurable properties that define the biotic components in soil and could potentially be used as a metric in determining soil functionality over a wide range of ecological conditions. However, it has been a challenge to determine effective bio-indicators of soil health due to its temporal and spatial resolutions at ecosystem levels. The objective of this review is to compile a set of effective bio-indicators for developing a better understanding of ecosystem restoration capabilities. It addresses a set of potential bio-indicators including microbial biomass, respiration, enzymatic activity, molecular gene markers, microbial metabolic substances, and microbial community analysis that have been responsive to a wide range of ecosystem functions in agricultural soils, mine deposited soil, heavy metal contaminated soil, desert soil, radioactive polluted soil, pesticide polluted soil, and wetland soils. The importance of ecosystem restoration in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals was also discussed. This review identifies key management strategies that can help in ecosystem restoration and maintain ecosystem stability.","The authors acknowledge Dr. Binoy Sarkar (University of South Australia) for his critical comments and checking of the overall manuscript.

Maize exhibits elevated susceptibility to Zn deficiency and low response to zinc fertilization. As a result, there are contradicting literature reports on the crop response to zinc fertilization. This meta-analysis synthesized the current evidence on maize response to zinc fertilization from different studies and highlighted the potential innovations to improve the crop response to zinc application. Systematic literature searches were conducted on the Web of Science and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed publications. From the selected publications, data extracted were maize grain yield and maize grain zinc concentration. The meta-analysis was conducted in R statistical environment using the metafor package. The ratio of means was the chosen effect size measure used. The assessment of effect size heterogeneity showed that the study effect sizes were significantly heterogeneous and also publication bias was evident. The analysis showed 17% and 25% maize grain yield and grain zinc concentration response to zinc fertilization. As a result, zinc fertilization was associated with yield increments of up to 1 t ha-1 and 7.19 mg kg-1 grain zinc concentration over the control (no zinc application). Despite the observed maize grain response to zinc application, the median concentration of grain Zn was below the 38 mg kg-1 recommended maize grain zinc concentration to combat human zinc deficiency (hidden hunger). As a result, potential innovations likely to achieve sufficient maize grain zinc content were highlighted including the use of nano-particulate zinc oxide, foliar zinc application, timing of zinc application, precision fertilization and zinc micro-dosing. Due to scanty literature on the progress of these innovations in maize, follow-up studies are recommended to evaluate their potential success in the agronomic bio-fortification of maize with zinc.",Declaration of competing interest The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.,,Heliyon,,,,2023-05-05,2023,2023-05-05,2023-05,9,5,e16040,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mutambu, Dominic; Kihara, Job; Mucheru-Muna, Monicah; Bolo, Peter; Kinyua, Michael","Mutambu, Dominic (Department of Environmental Sciences and Education, Kenyatta University, P.O Box 43844-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; Alliance of Bioversity International and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) c/o International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), Duduville Campus Off Kasarani Road, P.O Box 823 - 00621, Nairobi, Kenya); Kihara, Job (Alliance of Bioversity International and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) c/o International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), Duduville Campus Off Kasarani Road, P.O Box 823 - 00621, Nairobi, Kenya); Mucheru-Muna, Monicah (Department of Environmental Sciences and Education, Kenyatta University, P.O Box 43844-00100, Nairobi, Kenya); Bolo, Peter (Alliance of Bioversity International and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) c/o International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), Duduville Campus Off Kasarani Road, P.O Box 823 - 00621, Nairobi, Kenya); Kinyua, Michael (Alliance of Bioversity International and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) c/o International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), Duduville Campus Off Kasarani Road, P.O Box 823 - 00621, Nairobi, Kenya)","Mutambu, Dominic (Kenyatta University; International Center for Tropical Agriculture)","Mutambu, Dominic (Kenyatta University; International Center for Tropical Agriculture); Kihara, Job (International Center for Tropical Agriculture); Mucheru-Muna, Monicah (Kenyatta University); Bolo, Peter (International Center for Tropical Agriculture); Kinyua, Michael (International Center for Tropical Agriculture)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16040,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157771165,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production",2 Zero Hunger

Given the mixed findings of 237 primary empirical studies on the link between capital endowments - AGPTs adoption, this systematic quantitative review conducts a meta-regression analysis method to estimate the genuine effects of different capital endowments in terms of eleven proxy factors on AGPTs adoption in China. Combining the estimation strategies of Weighted Least Squares (WLS) and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), our findings reveal that three proxy factors (Technical training, Family income, and Government subsidies) are infected by publication bias, and the study-to-study variation between those published studies that focus on these proxy factors stems from several heterogeneity features, such as the types of AGPTs, measurements of adoption decision, and model specification. After controlling the above issues, there are still six proxy factors attached to five types of capital endowments-Technical training, Labor force, Assets, Land size, Social network, and Government subsidies-present positive and significant genuine effects on AGPTs adoption. These effects are robust to different estimation strategies or model specifications. As farmers normally possess a low level of capital endowment and willingness to adopt AGPTs in most developing countries, such study findings are expected to provide some enlightenment for future research and policies related to the effective promotion of AGPTs, which may contribute to carbon reduction, environmental protection of farmland, and agricultural sustainable development.",,,The Science of The Total Environment,,,,2023-06-30,2023,2023-06-30,2023-06,,,165175,Closed,Article,"Han, Hongyun; Zou, Kai; Yuan, Zhen","Han, Hongyun (China Academy for Rural Development, School of Public Affairs, Zhejiang University, China.

Disentangling the biogeographic patterns and key drivers of SOM decomposition and its temperature sensitivity (Q10 ) under plant invasion is a prerequisite for making projections of global carbon feedback. We collected soil samples along China's coast across saltmarshes to mangrove ecosystems invaded by the smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora Loisel.). Microcosm experiments were carried out to determine the patterns of SOM decomposition and its thermal response. Soil microbial biomass and communities were also characterized accordingly. SOM decomposition constant dramatically decreased along the mean annual temperature gradient, whereas the cordgrass invasion retarded this change (significantly reduced slope, p < 0.05). The response of Q10 to invasion and the soil microbial quotient peaked at midlatitude saltmarshes, which can be explained by microbial metabolism strategies. Climatic variables showed strong negative controls on the Q10 , whereas dissolved carbon fraction exerted a positive influence on its spatial variance. Higher microbial diversity appeared to weaken the temperature-related response of SOM decomposition, with apparent benefits for carbon sequestration. Inconsistent responses to invasion were exhibited among habitat types, with SOM accumulation in saltmarshes but carbon loss in mangroves, which were explained, at least in part, by the SOM decomposition patterns under invasion. This study elucidates the geographic pattern of SOM decomposition and its temperature sensitivity in coastal ecosystems and underlines the importance of interactions between climate, soil, and microbiota for stabilizing SOM under plant invasion.",ACKNOWLEDGMENT This study has been funded by the Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U2006215).

This paper reports on a Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) of articles published between 2000 and 2020. The studies reviewed were conducted in developed countries including UK, France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Canada, and USA. All articles were written in English. The REA includes studies on LCA of differing strains of meat poultry and production systems, studies on poultry manure emission and studies on environmental assessments of plant-based feed ingredients. The review covered studies on soil carbon dynamics associated with plant-based ingredients. Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed were used to obtain the 6,142 population articles. The multistage screening process resulted in 29 studies from which 15 studies included LCA while the rest 14 studies analyzed NH3 emission of broilers. All studies based on LCA were descriptive and did not include replications. Only 12 studies assessed the effect of interventions to reduce NH3 emission of broiler litter using replicated layout designs. It is concluded that the broiler industry in UK, EU, and North America cannot rely on results of existing LCA and environmental assessments studies to inform their nutritional strategy and poultry meat production due to a shortage of reliable in vivo data assessing interventions in controlled studies.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The systematic review was funded by AB Vista and the development of a journal output from the review was funded by innovate UK through an ISCF Future food production systems grant with Project number:48629.

This paper is the first formal meta-analysis to examine the phytotoxic effects of microplastics and their impact on soil functions in the plant-soil system. Our specific aims were to: 1) determine how the type and size of microplastics affect plant and soil health, 2) identify which agricultural plants are more sensitive to microplastics, and 3) investigate how the frequency and amount of microplastic pollution affect soil functions. Plant morphology, antioxidant production and photosynthesis capacity were impacted by the composition of polymers in microplastics, and the responses could be negative, positive or neutral depending on the polymer type. Phytotoxicity testing revealed that maize (Zea mays) was more sensitive than rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) within the Poaceae family, while wheat and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) were less sensitive to microplastics exposure. Microplastics-impacted soils tend to be more porous and retain more water, but this did not improve soil stability or increase soil microbial diversity, suggesting that microplastics occupied physical space but were not integrated into the soil biophysical matrix. The meta-data revealed that microplastics enhanced soil evapotranspiration, organic carbon, soil porosity, CO2 flux, water saturation, nitrogen content and soil microbial biomass, but decreased soil N2O flux, water stable aggregates, water use efficiency, soil bulk density and soil microbial diversity.","We like to acknowledge the assistance of soil ecologist Prof. Joann K.

We aimed to elucidate whether and how differential organic material amendments (manure versus peat-vermiculite) affect, relative to sole chemical fertilizer application, the link between microbial life history strategies and soil organic carbon storage in a wheat-maize rotation field experiment. To achieve this goal, we combined bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS amplicon sequencing, metagenomics and the assembly of genomes. Fertilizer treatments had a significantly greater effect on microbial community composition than aggregate size, with soil available phosphorus and potassium being the most important community-shaping factors. Limitation in labile carbon was linked to a K-selected oligotrophic life history strategy (Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria) under sole chemical fertilizer application; defined by a significant enrichment of genes involved in resource acquisition, polymer hydrolysis, and competition. By contrast, excess of labile carbon promoted an r-selected copiotrophic life history strategy (Cytophagales, Bacillales, Mortierellomycota) under manure treatment; defined by a significant enrichment of genes involved in cellular growth. A distinct life history strategy was not observed under peat-vermiculite treatment, but rather a mix of both K-selected (Acidobacteria) and r-selected (Actinobacteria, Mortierellomycota) microorganisms. Compared to sole chemical fertilizer application, soil organic carbon storage efficiency was significantly increased by 26.5% and 50.0% under manure and peat-vermiculite treatments, respectively. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of organic material amendments, but in particular a one-time peat-vermiculite application, to promote soil organic carbon storage as a potential management strategy for sustainable agriculture.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The development of cracks in soil strongly influences CO2 emissions, and soil amendment with biochar has been shown to reduce cracking. However, the impact of biochar on CO2 emissions during soil cracking is not well understood. This study investigates the release of CO2 flux during the cracking of peanut shell biochar-amended soil. The biochar-amended soil was incubated at a constant temperature of 35 °C for 160 h with periodic photography and analysis of CO2 concentration and soil moisture. To achieve continuous monitoring of incubation soil, a new coupled sensor was specially designed to measure CO2 concentration and soil moisture, based on the Arduino microcontroller. Measured results reveal that peanut shell biochar reduced the evaporation rate by 29 % compared to unamended soil, resulting in slower soil cracking caused by water loss. The biochar also decreased the shrinkage crack length by 20 % compared to unamended soil. In addition, the crack volume fraction was reduced by 16 % after the peanut shell biochar amendment. Due to the reduction of the soil crack channel openings during drying shrinkage when biochar was applied to the soil, cumulative CO2 fluxes were also reduced by 5 % compared to unamended soil. The presence of biochar induced more stable and larger compounds with the soil particles, which blocked the crack propagation path and inhibited further development of the crack.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, testing patterns of combined responses of plants and soils remains a knowledge gap for terrestrial ecosystems. We carried out a comprehensive review of the available literature and conducted a meta-analysis to explore combined plant and soil microbial responses in grasslands exposed to experimental precipitation changes. We measured the effects of experimental precipitation changes on plant biomass, biomass allocation, and soil microbial biomass and tested for trade-offs between plant and soil responses to altered precipitation. We found that aboveground and belowground plant biomass responded asynchronically to precipitation changes, thereby leading to shifts in plant biomass allocation. Belowground plant biomass did not change under precipitation changes, but aboveground plant biomass decreased in precipitation reduction and increased in precipitation addition. There was a trade-off between responses of aboveground plant biomass and belowground plant biomass to precipitation reduction, but correlation wasn't found for precipitation addition. Microbial biomass carbon (C) did not change under the treatments of precipitation reduction. Increased root allocation may buffer drought stress for soil microbes through root exudations and neutralize microbial responses to precipitation reduction. However, precipitation addition increased microbial biomass C, potentially reflecting the removal of water limitation for soil microbial growth. We found that there were positive correlations between responses of aboveground plant biomass and microbial biomass C to precipitation addition, indicating that increased shoot growth probably promoted microbial responses via litter inputs. In sum, our study suggested that aboveground, belowground plant biomass and soil microbial biomass can respond asynchronically to precipitation changes, and emphasizes that testing the plant-soil system as a whole is necessary for forecasting the effects of precipitation changes on grassland systems.",We thank Dr. Juliette M.G.

Globally, around 800,000 deaths were attributed to air pollution according to WHO. Evidence suggests that there has been a strong association of air pollution with stroke. Approximately, 25% of stroke mortality was due to air pollution according to a study in 2013.
Objective: The aim of this review was to analyze the association between stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage and air pollution and its burden globally with a special focus on South Asia along with its association with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Results: There is growing research data linking air pollution to cardiovascular disorders including stroke. Short-term and long-term air pollution exposures have been shown to increase stroke incidence in epidemiological data. Air pollution, both gaseous and particle, show a strong and tight temporal relationship with stroke hospitalizations and death. The link between ICH and SAH to air pollution is less strong and less well studied as compared to ischemic stroke. Stroke and air pollution both are highly prevalent in South Asia. It is possible that the high prevalence of stroke in south Asia may be linked to the high frequency of air pollution in addition to other conventional risk factors. Decreased stroke admissions and mortality and reduced cardiovascular mortality reported during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID) lockdown may be attributable to decreased levels of air pollution.
Conclusion: Even though air pollution poses a significant threat to human health, a great number of countries still fail to achieve internationally agreed air quality standards. Air pollution should be recognized among the most significant controllable risk factors for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease prevention and treatment.",,,Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology,,,,2022-09-05,2022,2022-09-05,2022,25,Suppl 1,s3-s8,All OA; Gold,Article,"Taimuri, Bushra; Lakhani, Sohail; Javed, Maryam; Garg, Divyani; Aggarwal, Vasundhara; Mehndiratta, Man Mohan; Wasay, Mohammad","Taimuri, Bushra (Department of Medicine, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan); Lakhani, Sohail (Department of Medicine, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan); Javed, Maryam (Department of Medicine, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan); Garg, Divyani (Department of Neurology, VMMC and Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, India); Aggarwal, Vasundhara (Department of Neurology, Janakpuri Super specialty Hospital, New Delhi, India); Mehndiratta, Man Mohan (Department of Neurology, BLK Hospital, New Delhi, India); Wasay, Mohammad (Department of Medicine, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan)","Wasay, Mohammad (Aga Khan University)","Taimuri, Bushra (Aga Khan University); Lakhani, Sohail (Aga Khan University); Javed, Maryam (Aga Khan University); Garg, Divyani (Vardhman Mahavir Medical College & Safdarjung Hospital); Aggarwal, Vasundhara (); Mehndiratta, Man Mohan (); Wasay, Mohammad (Aga Khan University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.4103/aian.aian_491_22,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150778411,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

However, the effect of MP pollution on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from farmland soil is yet unclear. Therefore, a series of microcosm experiments were set up using polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), and polyester (PET) at concentrations of 0.25 %, 2 %, and 7 % (w/w). Each treatment had three replicates. This experiment was carried out to verify the effect of MP pollution on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from farmland soil. The results showed that the addition of MPs significantly promoted the emissions of the three main GHGs, including nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4). Especially, PE may cause most GHG emissions which would contribute to climate warming when its pollution concentration increased. In addition, different doses and types of MPs could affect microbial community structure. These findings of this present study may provide a scientific and practical reference for the prevention and control of MPs pollution and risk assessment of global climate change caused by MPs.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

A national-scale data analysis in China,"Terracing practice is expected to reserve soil organic carbon (SOC) pools, which are the key components for maintaining soil fertility and land productivity. In China such practice is widespread from center to south since ancient time. In this work, to reveal the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of SOC under different terraced sites in China, we conducted a meta-analysis on 78 studies regarding terracing effects on SOC sequestration. The between-group heterogeneity analysis indicated that terracing land use, age, climatic background, and slope gradient were critical factors for SOC sequestration, while terracing structure and soil depth were not. Overall, for China's landscapes, terracing increased SOC sequestration by 32.4% on average. Relative to other terracing structures, level ditches and half-moon terraces receive more rainwater and fertile topsoil from upper slopes due to their specific concave structures. Terracing in those areas with lower temperatures and less precipitation showed higher SOC sequestration. The extent of SOC sequestration due to terracing was primarily determined by land use type. Reforestation terraces could increase SOC sequestration markedly by eliminating water erosion and related soil carbon loss. The terracing aged 1-2 years leads to a decrease of 6.4% averagely on SOC sequestration, likely because the breakdown of soil aggregates through soil excavation and redistribution improves the decomposition of SOC. Furthermore, terracing aged over five years was more effective on SOC sequestration. Since this study offered a useful synthesis on multiple terracing factors affecting soil carbon in China, it can help to provide a wiser utilization and management of terracing to maximize SOC sequestration, and to make better terracing practices in the context of global change.","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0501701), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41971129, 41991233), the Distinguished Membership Project of Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS, and the Innovation Project of the State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology (SKLURE2017-1-2).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,,2020-03-05,2020,2020-03-05,2020-06,721,,137751,Closed,Article,"Chen, Die; Wei, Wei; Daryanto, Stefani; Tarolli, Paolo","Chen, Die (State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China.); Wei, Wei (State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China.

Early life (from pregnancy through childhood) is a vulnerable window for exposure. Therefore, interventions in low- and middle-income countries to prevent or reduce early life exposure to cadmium may be relevant for improving public health.
Methods: We systematically reviewed five databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Global Health Medicus, Greenfile, and PubMed). A synthesis without meta-analysis (narrative synthesis) was used for data analysis due to the wide heterogeneity of included studies. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using modified GRADE criteria.
Results: 4098 articles were returned by the search and a total of 26 studies from 21 LMICs were included in this review, ranging from policies to clinical treatment, rehabilitation and clean-up methods for agricultural soil, interventions for nutrition and cooking, and anti-pollution strategies at the household level. The interventions targeted children, pregnant and postpartum women, and/or women of childbearing age. While several studies provided some evidence of effectiveness, none appeared to offer a realistic solution for cadmium pollution at scale. Agricultural and food preparation studies were relatively frequent, particularly related to rice. Studies on air filtration during pregnancy indicated some effectiveness in reducing indoor cadmium exposures.
Conclusions: Cadmium pollution is a persistent and widespread threat to children's health with few identified solutions. Long-lasting damage to children's health starting in the earliest years should motivate investment in higher-quality interventions, innovations, and further research.

The application of exogenous additives can effectively inhibit Cd bioavailability in soil and decrease Cd accumulation in wheat. However, a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of how additives affect wheat Cd accumulation, wheat yield, soil Cd availability, and soil properties is lacking. We conducted a meta-analysis of 65 peer-reviewed papers published before April 2021 to investigate how additives application affects Cd accumulation in wheat and soil Cd availability. The results indicated that most additives application decreased the diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid extractable-Cd content (5.27-56.33%) in the soil, and wheat grain and root Cd concentrations (0.03-129.87% and 0.42-52.84%, respectively); the pH values of wheat-grown soil and the properties of the additives affected the reduction percentage. Overall, most wheat-grown soils were calcareous soil (42 peer-reviewed papers); in calcareous soil, the magnitude of the Cd reduction in wheat grain was the highest under treatments with clay minerals (129.87%) due to clay modification, followed by composite (75.36%) and phosphorus materials (73.55%). Moreover, most additives application increased wheat grain yield by 0.03-51.84%, which was attributed to the positive effects of additives on wheat antioxidant capacity, photosynthesis, respiration, and nutrient uptake. Additives application increased the pH value of acidic wheat soil, and positively affected the electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, and organic carbon content of the wheat grown soil. In addition, regression analysis showed that soil available Cd was negatively correlated with the pH value with additives application in acidic soil (r2 = 0.43), while a non-significant correlation was observed in neutral and calcareous wheat soils (r2 = 0.017 and 0.016, respectively). The results of this study can assist in the selection, modification, and utilisation of additives to remediate Cd-contaminated wheat soils.","This work was sponsored by the National Science Projects of Henan University of Technology, China (31401421), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFD0800304 and 2016YFE0106400), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41471253), the Natural Science Projects of Henan University of Technology, China (2019BS037), and the Open fund project of State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Monitoring for Heavy Metal Pollutants (SKLMHM202106).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Agriculture; Cadmium; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Triticum,2021-12-02,2021,2021-12-02,2022-02,808,,152090,Closed,Article,"Wang, Yale; Xing, Weiqin; Liang, Xuefeng; Xu, Yingming; Wang, Yali; Huang, Qingqing; Li, Liping","Wang, Yale (School of the Environment, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, China.); Xing, Weiqin (School of the Environment, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, China.); Liang, Xuefeng (Innovation Team of Remediation for Heavy Metal Contaminated Farmlands, Agro-Environmental Protection Institute, Ministry of Agriculture, Tianjin 300191, China.); Xu, Yingming (Innovation Team of Remediation for Heavy Metal Contaminated Farmlands, Agro-Environmental Protection Institute, Ministry of Agriculture, Tianjin 300191, China.); Wang, Yali (School of the Environment, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, China.); Huang, Qingqing (Innovation Team of Remediation for Heavy Metal Contaminated Farmlands, Agro-Environmental Protection Institute, Ministry of Agriculture, Tianjin 300191, China.

However, its indicative capability for the soil CH4 sink is poorly understood due to the incomplete knowledge of the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, SOC is not explicitly included in the current model estimation of the global forest CH4 sink. Here, using in-situ observations, global meta-analysis, and process-based modeling, we provide evidence that SOC constitutes an important variable that governs the forest CH4 sink. We find that a CH4 sink is enhanced with increasing SOC content on regional and global scales. The revised model with SOC function better reproduces the field observation and estimates a 39% larger global forest CH4 sink (24.27 Tg CH4 yr−1) than the model without considering SOC effects (17.46 Tg CH4 yr−1). This study highlights the role of SOC in the forest CH4 sink, which shall be factored into future global CH4 budget quantification.","This study was supported by the Korea Forest Service (2017096A001719BB01), Ministry of Science and ICT of Korea (NRF-2020M1A5A1110494, NRF-2020R1I1A2072824), Ministry of Environment of Korea (2022003640002), and the Ministry of Education of Korea (NRF-2019H1A2A1076239, NRF-2021R1A6A3A03039376, NRF-2019R1A6A 3A01091184, NRF- 2022R1I1A1A01071925).",,Nature Communications,,,,2023-05-30,2023,2023-05-30,,14,1,3110,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lee, Jaehyun; Oh, Youmi; Lee, Sang Tae; Seo, Yeon Ok; Yun, Jeongeun; Yang, Yerang; Kim, Jinhyun; Zhuang, Qianlai; Kang, Hojeong","Lee, Jaehyun (School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, 03722, Seoul, Korea); Oh, Youmi (Global Monitoring Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Boulder, CO, USA; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA); Lee, Sang Tae (Forest Technology and Management Research Center, National Institute of Forest Science, Gyeonggi, Korea); Seo, Yeon Ok (Warm Temperate and Subtropical Forest Research Center, National Institute of Forest Science, Jeju, Korea); Yun, Jeongeun (School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, 03722, Seoul, Korea); Yang, Yerang (School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, 03722, Seoul, Korea); Kim, Jinhyun (School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, 03722, Seoul, Korea; Division of Life Sciences, Korea Polar Research Institute, 21990, Incheon, Korea); Zhuang, Qianlai (Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA); Kang, Hojeong (School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, 03722, Seoul, Korea)","Kang, Hojeong (Yonsei University)","Lee, Jaehyun (Yonsei University); Oh, Youmi (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences); Lee, Sang Tae (Korea Forest Service); Seo, Yeon Ok (); Yun, Jeongeun (Yonsei University); Yang, Yerang (Yonsei University); Kim, Jinhyun (Yonsei University; Korea Polar Research Institute); Zhuang, Qianlai (Purdue University West Lafayette); Kang, Hojeong (Yonsei University)",0,0,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38905-8.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158483818,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3007 Forestry Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences",

We quantified the effects of disturbance regimes on FCO2 across boreal, temperate, tropical and Mediterranean forests based on 1240 observations from 380 studies. Globally, climatic perturbations such as elevated CO2 concentration, warming and increased precipitation increase FCO2 by 13% to 25%. FCO2 is increased by forest conversion to grassland and elevated carbon input by forest management practices but reduced by decreased carbon input, fire and acid rain. Disturbance also changes soil temperature and water content, which in turn affect the direction and magnitude of disturbance influences on FCO2 . FCO2 is disturbance- and biome-type dependent and such effects should be incorporated into earth system models to improve the projection of the feedback between the terrestrial C cycle and climate change.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32101272 to Zilong Ma) and the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

5756,pub.1160235922,10.1002/jsfa.12819,37385969,,Changes in soil fertility under partial organic substitution of chemical fertilizer — A 33‐year trial,"BACKGROUND: This study examined the changes in soil fertility in a maize cropping area when chemical fertilizer was partially replaced with straw or livestock manure over a 33 years period. Four treatments were included: (1) CK (no fertilizer application); (2) NPK (only chemical fertilizer application); (3) NPKM (chemical fertilizer partly replaced with livestock manure); (4) NPKS (chemical fertilizer partly replaced with straw).
RUSULTS: Soil organic carbon increased by 41.7% and 95.5% in the NPKS and NPKM treatments, respectively, over the 33-year trial compared with the initial concentration. However, SOC in NPK was significantly reduced by 9.8%. Soil total N, P and K both increased in NPKM and NPKS treatments compared to the original soil. Soil pH was significantly acidified from 7.6 to 5.97 in the NPK treatment during the experimental period. The NPKM and NPKS treatments buffered the acidification compared to NPK. Meta-analysis results showed that, compared with NPK, NPKM significantly raised soil bacteria and fungi populations by 38.7% and 58.6%, enhanced microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen by 66.3% and 63%, respectively; and increased sucrase, urease and catalase activities by 34.2%, 48.2% and 21.5%. NPKS significantly increased soil fungi and actinomycetes populations by 24.3% and 41.2%, respectively; enhanced microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen by 27.1% and 45%, strengthened sucrase and urease activities by 36% and 20.3%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Long term chemical fertilizer application leaded to the deterioration of soil fertility and environment. Partial replacement of organic materials to chemical fertilizers could significantly amend and buffer such negative effects. This article is protected by copyright.

5754,pub.1147367358,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155463,35472351,,Soil inorganic carbon dynamic change mediated by anthropogenic activities: An integrated study using meta-analysis and random forest model,"Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) is an important component of the soil C reservoir, and its dynamic change is associated with global climate change. However, few studies have been conducted to quantitatively explore the response of SIC content to different anthropogenic activities and their interactions with edaphic and climatic factors as well as the relative importance of each influencing factor. Here, we addressed these knowledge gaps by combining meta-analysis and the random forest (RF) model, based on data compiled from 101 studies. The quantitative effects of anthropogenic, edaphic, and climatic factors and their interactions on SIC content were first examined using the meta-analysis method, and then the relative importance of each examined factor was further determined using the RF model. The results demonstrated that SIC content significantly increased by 6.55% and 9.25% for cultivation and land use change, respectively, compared with that of the control, regardless of any influencing factors. Moreover, the grand mean changes in SIC content due to anthropogenic activities were found to be greatly affected by varied climatic, edaphic, and practical factors. In addition, the relative importance of each factor examined was ordered as follows: pH (18.2%) > soil type (16.4%) > mean annual precipitation (16.3%) > bulk density (15.2%) > soil depth (13.4%) > mean annual temperature (13.0%) > land use type (7.52%). Our study suggests that a combination of meta-analysis and RF model is a powerful method for systematically exploring dynamic changes in SIC content.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42171116, 42177225, and 41703084), Demonstration and Guidance Program for Technology People-Benefit in Qingdao (20-3-4-6-nsh and 21-1-4-ny-1-nsh), and Science and Technology Support Plan for Youth Innovation of Colleges in Shandong Province (DC2000000961), China.",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Carbon; Climate Change; Soil,2022-04-25,2022,2022-04-25,2022-08,835,,155463,Closed,Article,"Dang, Chunrong; Kong, Fanlong; Li, Yue; Jiang, Zhixiang; Xi, Min","Dang, Chunrong (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China; Carbon Neutrality and Eco-Environmental Technology Innovation Center of Qingdao, Qingdao 266071, China.); Kong, Fanlong (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China; Carbon Neutrality and Eco-Environmental Technology Innovation Center of Qingdao, Qingdao 266071, China.); Li, Yue (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China; Carbon Neutrality and Eco-Environmental Technology Innovation Center of Qingdao, Qingdao 266071, China.); Jiang, Zhixiang (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China; Carbon Neutrality and Eco-Environmental Technology Innovation Center of Qingdao, Qingdao 266071, China.

Livestocks play a key role in regulating the C cycle in grasslands. However, the interrelationship between SOC and these drivers remains unclear at different soil layers, and their potential relationships network have rarely been quantitatively assessed. Here, we completed a six-year manipulation experiment of grazing exclusion (no grazing: NG) and increasing grazing intensity (light grazing: LG, medium grazing: MG, heavy grazing: HG). We tested light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) and heavy fraction organic carbon (HFOC) in 12 plots along grazing intensity in three soil layers (topsoil: 0-10 cm, mid-soil: 10-30 cm, subsoil: 30-50 cm) to assess the drivers of SOC. Grazing significantly reduced SOC of the soil profile, but with significant depth and time dependencies. (1) SOC and SOC stability of the topsoil is primarily regulated by grazing duration (years). Specifically, grazing duration and grazing intensity increased the SOC lability of topsoil due to an increase in LFOC. (2) Grazing intensity was the major factor affecting the mid-soil SOC dynamics, among which MG had significantly lower SOC than did NG. (3) Subsoil organic carbon dynamics were mainly regulated by climatic factors. The increase in mean annual temperature (MAT) may have promoted the turnover of LFOC to HFOC in the subsoil. Synthesis and applications. When evaluating the impacts of grazing on soil organic fraction, we need to consider the differences in sampling depth and the duration of grazing years. Our results highlight that the key factors influencing SOC dynamics differ among soil layers. Climatic and grazing factors have different roles in determining SOC in each soil layer.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank H. Li, Z.Y., and X. Li for their assistance with the field observations.

Network analysis indicated that clusters 1 and 4 which dominated by Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria shown significantly positive correlation with humic acid concentration. Notably, the structural equational model and variance partitioning analysis demonstrated that bacterial community structure (explained 47.82% of the variation) mediated the effect of raw material feeding ratio on humification, and exceeded the effect of environmental factors (explained 19.30% of the variation) on humic acid formation.

The impacts of climate warming on woody plants are predicted to be severe, but the effects on the fine root traits of woody plants remain unclear. To evaluate the effects of warming on fine-root traits of woody plants, we synthesized 431 paired observations of 13 traits from 78 studies. The result showed that warming increased the fine root nitrogen (N) concentration, root mortality, and root respiration, but decreased fine root phosphorus (P) concentration, root C:N and root nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) concentration. However, warming had no significant effect on fine root biomass, root production and morphological traits. Warming effects on fine root biomass and root diameter decreased with warming magnitude, while root P concentration increased. Moreover, with increasing warming duration, the effect size of specific root length (SRL), root length, root C:N and root NSC increased. The effects size of root biomass, root diameter, root length and root C:N decreased with mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) increase. However, the effect size of root N concentration increased with higher MAT and MAP. Furthermore, warming increased the fine root biomass of ectomycorrhiza (ECM) plants, but decreased that of plants associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. These results indicate that the effect of warming on fine root traits of woody plants was not only modulated by warming duration and magnitude, but also MAT and MAP. Our findings highlight the differential warming responses to fine root traits of woody plants, which have strong implications for shrubs and tree-dominated ecosystems soil nutrients cycling and carbon stocks.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Anthropogenic inputs of P to ecosystems are increasing; however, our understanding of the impacts of P addition on terrestrial ecosystem C:N:P ratios remains elusive. By conducting a meta-analysis with 1413 paired observations from 121 publications, we showed that P addition significantly decreased plant, soil, and microbial biomass N:P and C:P ratios, but had negligible effects on C:N ratios. The reductions in N:P and C:P ratios became more evident as the P application rates and experimental duration increased. The P addition effects on terrestrial ecosystem C:N:P stoichiometry did not vary with ecosystem types or climates. Moreover, the responses of N:P and C:P ratios in soil and microbial biomass were associated with the responses of soil pH and fungi:bacteria ratios. Additionally, P additions increased net primary productivity, microbial biomass, soil respiration, N mineralization, and N nitrification, but decreased ammonium and nitrate contents. Decreases in plant N:P and C:P ratios were both negatively correlated to net primary productivity and soil respiration, but positively correlated to ammonium and nitrate contents; microbial biomass, soil respiration, ammonium contents, and nitrate contents all increased with declining soil N:P and C:P ratios. Our findings highlight that P additions could imbalance C:N:P stoichiometry and potentially impact the terrestrial ecosystem functions.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank all of the scientists whose work was included in this meta‐analysis and editorial comments from Zheng Shi.

Inclusion of legumes (e.g., hairy vetch, Vicia villosa Roth) in the farming system can reduce the nitrogen (N) fertilizer needs for cereals such as maize (Zea mays L.) crop while maintaining or increasing its productivity. The aims of this research study were to quantify the effect of hairy vetch as a cover crop on: i) successor maize yield under varying yield environments (YEs) and fertilizer N rates, and ii) maize N status [N uptake, N nutritional index (NNI), and N fertilizer replacement value (NFRV)] at flowering time. Two field studies were carried out in Southern Brazil under varying YEs. The factors investigated were: YE (low, medium, and high), hairy vetch cover crop (with and without), and fertilizer N rate (0, 60, 120, 180, and 240 kg N ha-1). Under the combination of low YE and low fertilizer N rates (0-60 kg ha-1) with previous vetch, maize displayed the largest yield response and an improvement in its N status. The NNI determined at maize flowering was an efficient index of the vetch effect, increasing delta maize yield response (yield with- minus without-vetch) as the NNI reduced, with more than 10% delta yield response with NNI below 0.85. The NFRV of the hairy vetch represents potential N savings of 151 kg N ha-1 for the LYE, 95 kg N ha-1 for the MYE and from 59 to 45 kg N ha-1 for the HYE depending on the tested fertilizer N rate. The N coming from the legume cover crop in addition to the N fertilization was critical for supplying N to maize and boosting productivity across all YEs.","The authors thank the farmer (Rogério Pacheco and his staff) for their cooperation with this study.

Field-based assessments of plant and soil C contents and stocks of various LULCC types were conducted in nine regions along the coastline of China (21°-40°N). These regions cover natural coastal wetlands (NWs, including salt marshes and mangroves) and former wetlands converted to different LULCC types, including reclaimed wetlands (RWs), dry farmlands (DFs), paddy fields (PFs) and aquaculture ponds (APs). The results showed that LULCC generally decreased the C contents and stocks of the plant-soil system by 29.6 % ± 2.5 % and 40.4 % ± 9.2 %, respectively, while it slightly increased the soil inorganic C contents and stocks. Wetlands converted to APs and RWs lost greater ecosystem organic C stocks (EOC, sum of plants and top 30 cm of soil organic C stocks) than other LULCC types. The annual potential CO2 emissions estimated from EOC loss depended on the LULCC type, with an average emission of 7.92 ± 2.94 Mg CO2-eq ha-1 yr-1. The change rate of EOC in all LULCC types showed a significantly deceasing trend with increasing latitude (p < 0.05). The loss of EOC due to LULCC was larger in mangroves than in salt marshes. The results showed that the response of plant and soil C variables to LULCC was mainly related to differences in plant biomass, median grain size, soil water content and soil NH4+-N content. This study emphasized the importance of LULCC in triggering C loss in natural coastal wetlands, which strengthens the greenhouse effect. We suggest that the current land-based climate models and climate mitigation policies must account for specific land-use types and their associated land management practices to achieve more effective emission reduction.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Belowground consumers create complex food webs that regulate functioning, ensure stability and support biodiversity both below and above ground. However, existing soil food-web reconstructions do not match recently accumulated empirical evidence and there is no comprehensive reproducible approach that accounts for the complex resource, size and spatial structure of food webs in soil. Here I build on generic food-web organisation principles and use multifunctional classification of soil protists, invertebrates and vertebrates, to reconstruct a 'multichannel' food web across size classes of soil-associated consumers. I infer weighted trophic interactions among trophic guilds using feeding preferences and prey protection traits (evolutionarily inherited traits), size and spatial distributions (niche overlaps), and biomass-dependent feeding. I then use food-web reconstruction, together with assimilation efficiencies, to calculate energy fluxes assuming a steady-state energetic system. Based on energy fluxes, I propose a number of indicators, related to stability, biodiversity and multiple ecosystem-level functions such as herbivory, top-down control, translocation and transformation of organic matter. I illustrate this approach with an empirical example, comparing it with traditional resource-focused soil food-web reconstruction. The multichannel reconstruction can be used to assess 'trophic multifunctionality' (analogous to ecosystem multifunctionality), i.e. simultaneous support of multiple trophic functions by the food web, and compare it across communities and ecosystems spanning beyond the soil. With further empirical validation of the proposed functional indicators, this multichannel reconstruction approach could provide an effective tool for understanding animal diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in soil. This tool hopefully will inspire more researchers to describe soil communities and belowground-aboveground interactions comprehensively. Such studies will provide informative indicators for including consumers as active agents in biogeochemical models, not only locally but also on regional and global scales.","The work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) project number 192626868 – SFB 990 in the framework of the collaborative German–Indonesian research project CRC990 – EFForTS.

Upon environmental perturbation, microbes are also amongst the first natural responsive elements with perturbation-specific cues and markers. These communities are thereby uniquely positioned to inform on the status of environmental conditions. The advent of microbial omics has led to an unprecedented volume of complex microbiological data sets. Importantly, these data sets are rich in biological information with potential for predictive environmental classification and forecasting. However, the patterns in this information are often hidden amongst the inherent complexity of the data. There has been a continued rise in the development and adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning architectures for solving research challenges of this sort. Indeed, the interface between molecular microbial ecology and artificial intelligence (AI) appears to show considerable potential for significantly advancing environmental monitoring and management practices through their application. Here, we provide a primer for ML, highlight the notion of retaining biological sample information for supervised ML, discuss workflow considerations, and review the state of the art of the exciting, yet nascent, interdisciplinary field of ML-driven microbial ecology. Current limitations in this sphere of research are also addressed to frame a forward-looking perspective toward the realization of what we anticipate will become a pivotal toolkit for addressing environmental monitoring and management challenges in the years ahead.",We would like to acknowledge valuable discussions on this topic with Olivier Monga and Andreas Henschel.,This work was funded by the Competitive Internal Research Award (CIRA2019-019) of Khalifa University.,Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2022-04-25,2022,2022-04-25,,13,,851450,All OA; Gold,Article,"McElhinney, James M.

To characterize EPFR exposure and resulting health impacts, it is necessary to identify and systematize analysis protocols. Both direct measurement and solvent extraction methods have been applied to analyze environmental samples containing EPFR. The use of different protocols and solvents in EPFR analyses makes it difficult to compare results among studies. In this work, we reviewed EPFR studies that involved solvent extraction and carefully reported the details of the extraction methodology and retrieval recovery. EPFR recovery depends on the structure of the radical species and the solvent. For the limited number of studies available for review, the polar solvents had superior recovery in more studies. Radicals appeared to be more oxygen-centered following extraction for fly ash and particulate matter (PM) samples. Different solvent extraction methods to retrieve EPFR may produce molecular products during the extraction, thus potentially changing the sample toxicity. The number of studies reporting detailed methodologies is limited, and data in these studies were not consistently reported. Thus, inference about the solvent and protocol that leads to the highest EPFR extraction efficiency for certain types of radicals is not currently possible. Based on our review, we proposed reporting criteria to be included for future EPFR studies.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,This work was supported by the NIEHS Superfund Research Program (P42 ES013648).,Chemosphere,,,Coal Ash; Free Radicals; Particulate Matter; Reactive Oxygen Species; Solvents,2021-06-29,2021,2021-06-29,2021-12,284,,131353,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Guo, Chuqi; Richmond-Bryant, Jennifer","Guo, Chuqi (Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA.

Organic matter (OM) additions to soils can affect the rate at which SOC is mineralized by microbes, with potentially important effects on SOC stocks. Understanding how pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) affects the cycling of native SOC (nSOC) and the soil microbes responsible for these effects is important for fire-affected ecosystems as well as for biochar-amended systems. We used an incubation trial with five different soils from National Ecological Observatory Network sites across the US and 13C-labelled 350°C corn stover PyOM and fresh corn stover OM to trace nSOC-derived CO2 emissions with and without PyOM and OM amendments. We used high-throughput sequencing of rRNA genes to characterize bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities and their response to PyOM and OM in soils that were previously stored at -80°C. We found that the effects of amendments on nSOC-derived CO2 reflected the unamended soil C status, where relative increases in C mineralization were greatest in low-C soils. OM additions produced much greater effects on nSOC-CO2 emissions than PyOM additions. Furthermore, the magnitude of microbial community composition change mirrored the magnitude of increases in nSOC-CO2, indicating a specific subset of microbes were likely responsible for the observed changes in nSOC mineralization. However, PyOM responders differed across soils and did not necessarily reflect a common ""charosphere"". Overall, this study suggests that soils that already have low SOC may be particularly vulnerable to short-term increases in SOC loss with OM or PyOM additions.Importance Soil organic matter (SOM) has an important role in global climate change, carbon and nutrient cycling in soils, and soil moisture dynamics. Understanding the processes that affect SOM stocks is important for managing these functions. Recently, understanding how fire-affected organic matter (or ""pyrogenic"" organic matter (PyOM)) affects existing SOM stocks has become increasingly important, both due to changing fire regimes, and to interest in ""biochar"" - pyrogenic organic matter that is produced intentionally for carbon management or as an agricultural soil amendment. We found that soils with less SOM were more prone to increased losses with PyOM (and fresh organic matter) additions, and that soil microbial communities changed more in soils that also had greater SOM losses with PyOM additions. This suggests that soils that already have low SOM content may be particularly vulnerable to short-term increases in SOM loss, and that a subset of the soil microbial community is likely responsible for these effects.","We thank Dominic Woolf, who was instrumental in helping develop the original R script that was modified to analyze these data.

5745,pub.1137969749,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126051,34492892,,Long-term exposure to fine particulate constituents and cardiovascular diseases in Chinese adults,"BACKGROUND: Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been linked to various cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints. However, little is known regarding the health effects of PM2.5 constituents. This study aimed to assess the associations of CVD incidence with long-term exposures to PM2.5 constituents in China, including black carbon (BC), organic matter (OM), sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+).
METHODS: A nationwide cohort of 14,331 adults were drawn from the China Family Panel Study, a high-quality longitudinal survey initiated from 2010 over 25 provincial regions in China. We used the baseline survey and the ensuing three waves of follow-up data during 2010-2017 to conceive our study cohort. Annual county-level exposures of PM2.5 and its constituents for each participant were assessed by aggregating satellite-derived estimates at a monthly time-scale and 1 km-resolution. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) was developed to identify confounding variables. Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying exposures and province-level random intercepts were employed to quantify associations of CVD incidence with long-term exposures to PM2.5 and its constituents.
RESULTS: During 84,162.4 person-years' follow-up, a total of 1575 CVD, 953 hypertension and 342 stroke incidents occurred. DAG-based Cox model estimated an hazard ratio (HR) of 1.291 (95% confidence interval: 1.147-1.454) for total CVD and 1.326 (1.151-1.528) for hypertension, associated with per interquartile range (IQR=27.9 μg/m3) increase in exposure to PM2.5 mass. Elevated CVD risks were also significantly related to several PM2.5 constituents, with the largest HRs observed in SO42- (1.721 [1.517-1.951], IQR = 5.67 μg/m3), followed by NH4+ (1.537 [1.341-1.762], IQR = 4.44 μg/m3), NO3- (1.311 [1.128-1.523], IQR = 8.92 μg/m3) and BC (1.294 [1.158-1.446], IQR = 2.28 μg/m3). No associations were identified between long-term exposures to particulate constituents and incidence of stroke. Associations with PM2.5 and constituents (BC, NO3-, NH4+ and SO42-) were more pronounced among adults aged over 50 years, and residents in southern region.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposures to PM2.5 mass and specific constituents (i.e., BC, NO3-, NH4+ and SO42-) were associated with increased risks of total CVD and hypertension incidence in Chinese adults. Findings may have implications for in-depth understandings of biological mechanisms in chronic impacts of ambient PM2.5 on cardiovascular health.","This study was supported by Science and Technology Research Project of Hubei Provincial Department of Education (Grant No. Q20201104), Open Fund Project of Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Occupational Hazard Identification and Control (Grant No. OHIC2020Y01), the Key Research Center for Humanities and Social Sciences in Hubei Province (Hubei University of Medicine) (Grant No. 2020ZD001), and Outstanding Young and Middle Aged Technology Innovation Team Project of Hubei Provincial Department of Education (Grant No. T2020003).

However, it can also have an adverse effect on the environment. Thus, assessing an ecological restoration project's impact is crucial to determining its success and optimum management strategies. We performed a meta-analysis concerning the environmental outcomes during the years 2000-2015 resulting from the ""Grain for Green"" Project (GFGP) implementation in the Loess Plateau (LP). Data were gathered from 40 peer-reviewed English-language articles chosen from a pool of 332 articles. The results showed that, on average, GFGP increased forest coverage by 35.7% (95% CI [24.15-47.52%]), and grassland by 1.05% (95% CI [0.8-1.28%]). At the same time, GFGP has a positive impact on soil carbon (C) sequestration, net ecosystem production (NEP), and net primary production (NPP), from the years 2000 to 2015 by an average of 36% (95% CI [28.96-43.18%]), 22.7% (95% CI [9.10-36.79%]), and 13.5% (95% CI [9.44-17.354%]), respectively. Soil erosion, sediment load, runoff coefficient, and water yield were reduced by 13.3% (95% CI [0.27-25.76%]), 21.5% (95% CI [1.50-39.99%]), 22.4% (95% CI [5.28-40.45%]) and 43.3% (95% CI [27.03-82.86%]), respectively, from the years 2000 to 2015. Our results indicate that water supply decreased with the increase of vegetation coverage. Therefore, to balance the needs for green space, GFGP policies and strategies should recover, enhance, and sustain more resilient ecosystems.",We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their constructive suggestions on this article.,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41671295) and the National Key R & D Program of China (No. 2017YFD0200106), and 111 Project (No. B12007).

Given the importance of organic N cycling and the rise of global change, we investigated the responses of soil protein depolymerization and microbial amino acid consumption to increased temperature, elevated atmospheric CO2 , and drought. The study was conducted in a global change facility in a managed montane grassland in Austria, where elevated CO2 (eCO2 ) and elevated temperature (eT) were stimulated for 4 years, and were combined with a drought event. Gross protein depolymerization and microbial amino acid consumption rates (alongside with gross organic N mineralization and nitrification) were measured using 15 N isotope pool dilution techniques. Whereas eCO2  showed no individual effect, eT had distinct effects which were modulated by season, with a negative effect of eT on soil organic N process rates in spring, neutral effects in summer, and positive effects in fall. We attribute this to a combination of changes in substrate availability and seasonal temperature changes. Drought led to a doubling of organic N process rates, which returned to rates found under ambient conditions within 3 months after rewetting. Notably, we observed a shift in the control of soil protein depolymerization, from plant substrate controls under continuous environmental change drivers (eT and eCO2 ) to controls via microbial turnover and soil organic N availability under the pulse disturbance (drought). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which analyzed the individual versus combined effects of multiple global change factors and of seasonality on soil organic N processes and thereby strongly contributes to our understanding of terrestrial N cycling in a future world.","This project was financially supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF, P28572‐B22).

However, agricultural systems are usually evaluated on their productivity and economic performance, and a systematic and quantitative assessment of the multifunctionality of agroecosystems including environmental services is missing. Using a long-term farming system experiment, we evaluated and compared the agronomic, economic, and ecological performance of the most widespread arable cropping systems in Europe: organic, conservation, and conventional agriculture. We analyzed 43 agroecosystem properties and determined overall agroecosystem multifunctionality. We show that organic and conservation agriculture promoted ecosystem multifunctionality, especially by enhancing regulating and supporting services, including biodiversity preservation, soil and water quality, and climate mitigation. In contrast, conventional cropping showed reduced multifunctionality but delivered highest yield. Organic production resulted in higher economic performance, thanks to higher product prices and additional support payments. Our results demonstrate that different cropping systems provide opposing services, enforcing the productivity-environmental protection dilemma for agroecosystem functioning.","We thank B. Dorn, W.

However, the yield gains results reported in the existing literature through the co-application of fertilizer with biochar are conflicting. To resolve this, we utilized a meta-analysis of 627 paired data points extracted from 57 published articles to assess the performance of the co-application of biochar and fertilizers on crop yield compared with the corresponding controls. We also studied the impact of biochar characteristics, experimental conditions, and soil properties on crop yield. Our analysis showed that individually, biochar and inorganic fertilizer increased crop yield by 25.3% ± 3.2 (Bootstrap CI 95%) and 21.9% ± 4.4, respectively. The co-application of biochar with both inorganic and organic fertilizers increased crop yield by 179.6% ± 18.7, however, this data needs to be treated with caution due to the limited dataset. The highest yield increase was observed with amendments to very acidic soils (pH ≤5), but the benefits of biochar were not affected by the rate and the time after the application. In addition, the effects of biochar are enhanced when it is produced at 401-500 °C with a C:N ratio of 31-100. Our results suggest that the co-application of biochar with either inorganic and/or organic fertilizers in acidic soils increase crop productivity compared to amendment with either fertilizer or biochar. Our meta-analysis supports the utilization of biochar to enhance the efficiency and profitability of fertilizers.",Thanks to authors whose published data was used in this meta-analysis.

Most C estimation protocols utilize a default dead wood CF of 50%, but live tree studies suggest this value is an over-estimate. Here, we compile and analyze a global database of dead wood CFs in trees, showing that dead wood CFs average 48.5% across forests, deviating significantly from 50%, and varying systematically among biomes, taxonomic divisions, tissue types, and decay classes. Utilizing data-driven dead wood CFs in tropical forests alone may correct systematic overestimates in dead wood C stocks of ~3.0 Pg C: an estimate approaching nearly the entire dead wood C pool in the temperate forest biome.

Results indicated that among all the individual drivers, soil nutrients are most sensitive to N addition. Significant positive effects of N addition on carbon concentration (+4.6%), nitrogen concentration (+6.1%), organic carbon (+5.0%), and available nitrogen (+74.6%) were observed considering all the land-use types. The results highlighted that the combined and interactive effects of multiple global change factors on soil nutrients were of great significance.

Previous syntheses showed that manuring-induced SOC changes varied substantially with agricultural managements and environmental conditions, while their significance and relative importance to such variability are still largely uncertain. Here, we presented a new synthesis using an updated and balanced database integrating the manuring-induced SOC stock changes and their plausible explanatory factors in 250 observations at global 120 sites. Manure application increased SOC stock by 7.41 ± 1.14 (95% confidence interval, CI) and 8.96 ± 1.83 (95% CI) Mg C ha-1 , respectively, compared to their mineral fertilized (REF-min) and unfertilized (REF-zero) references. Of which approx. 72% and 34% were directly contributed by manure-C input, respectively. Following the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) approach, these changes corresponded to the manuring-induced SOC change factors of 1.27 ± 0.04 (95% CI) and 1.40 ± 0.08 (95% CI), respectively. Basing on a balanced database, we identified the amount of manure-C input as the most important factor to the global variations in the resultant SOC stock changes. More importantly, our integrative analysis distinguished the significance of soil properties (e.g., soil pH and initial SOC content) in regulating the efficiency of manure application in enhancing SOC stock. These results indicate that, at the similar rate, applying manure could sequestrate much more carbon in alkaline soils than in neutral and acidic soils. By integrating the impacts of agricultural managements and environmental conditions, our findings would help to develop region-specific tailor-made manure application measures in agriculture and to refine the SOC change factors for regional GHG inventories.",We thank all the individuals and institutions that contributed available datasets to this work.

However, few studies have worked on protein profiles, and most of them have focused on specific diets like vegetarian or vegan diets. Furthermore, the description of the environmental impact of diets has often been limited to greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) and land use. This paper analyzes the alignment of environmental pressures and nutritional impacts in a diversity of representative protein profiles of a western population. Using data from a representative survey in France (INCA3, n = 1125), we identified protein profiles using hierarchical ascendant classification on protein intake (g) from main protein sources (refined grains, whole grains, dairy, eggs, ruminant meat, poultry, pork, processed meat, fish, fruits & vegetables, pulses). We assessed their diet quality using 6 dietary scores, including assessment of long-term risk for health, and associated 14 environmental pressure indicators using the Agribalyse database completed by the SHARP database for GHGe. Five protein profiles were identified according to the high contributions of ruminant meat, pork, poultry, fish, or, conversely, as low contribution from meat. The profile including the lowest protein from meat had the lowest impact on almost all environmental indicators and had the lowest long-term risk. Conversely, the profile with high protein from ruminant-based foods had the highest pressures on most environmental indicators, including GHGe. We found that the protein profile with low contribution from meat has great potential for human health and environment preservation. Shifting a large part of the population toward this profile could be an easy first step toward building a more sustainable diet.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Animals; Humans; Diet; Dietary Proteins; Meat; Environment; Greenhouse Gases,2022-09-28,2022,2022-09-28,2023-01,856,Pt 1,159052,All OA; Green,Article,"Perraud, Elie; Wang, Juhui; Salomé, Marion; Mariotti, François; Kesse-Guyot, Emmanuelle","Perraud, Elie (Université Paris-Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRAE, UMR PNCA, 91120, Palaiseau, France.); Wang, Juhui (Université Paris-Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRAE, UMR PNCA, 91120, Palaiseau, France.); Salomé, Marion (Université Paris-Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRAE, UMR PNCA, 91120, Palaiseau, France.); Mariotti, François (Université Paris-Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRAE, UMR PNCA, 91120, Palaiseau, France.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of the mightiest GHGs, and agriculture is one of the main sources of N2O emissions. In this paper, we reviewed the mechanisms triggering N2O emissions and the role of agricultural practices in their mitigation. The amount of N2O produced from the soil through the combined processes of nitrification and denitrification is profoundly influenced by temperature, moisture, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen contents. These factors can be manipulated to a significant extent through field management practices, influencing N2O emission. The relationships between N2O occurrence and factors regulating it are an important premise for devising mitigation strategies. Here, we evaluated various options in the literature and found that N2O emissions can be effectively reduced by intervening on time and through the method of N supply (30-40%, with peaks up to 80%), tillage and irrigation practices (both in non-univocal way), use of amendments, such as biochar and lime (up to 80%), use of slow-release fertilizers and/or nitrification inhibitors (up to 50%), plant treatment with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (up to 75%), appropriate crop rotations and schemes (up to 50%), and integrated nutrient management (in a non-univocal way). In conclusion, acting on N supply (fertilizer type, dose, time, method, etc.) is the most straightforward way to achieve significant N2O reductions without compromising crop yields. However, tuning the rest of crop management (tillage, irrigation, rotation, etc.) to principles of good agricultural practices is also advisable, as it can fetch significant N2O abatement vs. the risk of unexpected rise, which can be incurred by unwary management.",,This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2016YFD0300208); National Natural Science Foundation of China (41661070); and Key disciplines (construction) of ecology in the 13th Five-Year Plan of Jiangxi Agricultural University.,Life,,,,2022-03-17,2022,2022-03-17,,12,3,439,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hassan, Muhammad Umair; Aamer, Muhammad; Mahmood, Athar; Awan, Masood Iqbal; Barbanti, Lorenzo; Seleiman, Mahmoud F.; Bakhsh, Ghous; Alkharabsheh, Hiba M.; Babur, Emre; Shao, Jinhua; Rasheed, Adnan; Huang, Guoqin","Hassan, Muhammad Umair (Research Center on Ecological Sciences, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China;, muhassanuaf@gmail.com, (M.U.H.);, muhammadaamer@jxau.edu.cn, (M.A.);, jinhuashao1@gmail.com, (J.S.)); Aamer, Muhammad (Research Center on Ecological Sciences, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China;, muhassanuaf@gmail.com, (M.U.H.);, muhammadaamer@jxau.edu.cn, (M.A.);, jinhuashao1@gmail.com, (J.S.)); Mahmood, Athar (Department of Agronomy, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan;, athar.mahmood@uaf.edu.pk); Awan, Masood Iqbal (Department of Agronomy, Sub-Campus Depalpur, Okara, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan;, masood.awan@uaf.edu.pk); Barbanti, Lorenzo (Department of Agriculture, Food Sciences University of Bologna, 40127 Bologna, Italy;, lorenzo.barbanti@unibo.it); Seleiman, Mahmoud F.

However, this practice often increases emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Previous meta-analyses have linked various biochemical properties of crop residues to N2O emissions, but the relationships between these properties have been overlooked, hampering our ability to predict N2O emissions from specific residues. Here we combine comprehensive databases for N2O emissions from crop residues and crop residue biochemical characteristics with a random-meta-forest approach, to develop a predictive framework of crop residue effects on N2O emissions. On average, crop residue incorporation increased soil N2O emissions by 43% compared to residue removal, however crop residues led to both increases and reductions in N2O emissions. Crop residue effects on N2O emissions were best predicted by easily degradable fractions (i.e. water soluble carbon, soluble Van Soest fraction (NDS)), structural fractions and N returned with crop residues. The relationship between these biochemical properties and N2O emissions differed widely in terms of form and direction. However, due to the strong correlations among these properties, we were able to develop a simplified classification for crop residues based on the stage of physiological maturity of the plant at which the residue was generated. This maturity criteria provided the most robust and yet simple approach to categorize crop residues according to their potential to regulate N2O emissions. Immature residues (high water soluble carbon, soluble NDS and total N concentration, low relative cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin fractions, and low C:N ratio) strongly stimulated N2O emissions, whereas mature residues with opposite characteristics had marginal effects on N2O. The most important crop types belonging to the immature residue group - cover crops, grasslands and vegetables - are important for the delivery of multiple ecosystem services. Thus, these residues should be managed properly to avoid their potentially high N2O emissions.","This study was supported by the FACCE ERA-GAS Cofund (European Research Area – for mitigation of Greenhouse gases from Agri- and Silvi-culture; id number: 696356), project ResidueGas (https://projects.au.dk/residuegas/).

However, this growth has raised environmental concerns due to the high discharge of empty fruit bunches, palm oil mill effluents, and other solid wastes. Therefore, this study aims to examine the treatment of palm oil waste by composting and systematically review insights into its application through a systematic literature review approach. Among the 1155 articles, a total of 135 were selected for a systematic review of palm oil waste management developments and their applications, while 14 were used for determining compost quality according to the criteria and requirements established in the systematic literature review. Moreover, using Egger's test, JAMOVI 1.6.23 software was used to analyze random effects models with 95% confidence intervals and publication bias. The results showed that palm oil waste was optimally treated by composting, which is considered as a sustainable technology for protecting the environment, human safety, and economic value. The in-vessel method with a controlled composting chamber is the best system with a minimum time of 14 days. However, it requires tight control and provides a final product with a high microbial colony form outdoors and indoors compared to the windrow system. This study is useful to see the bias of research results and helps to find new studies that need to be developed, especially in this case related to the management of palm oil waste into organic compost fertilizer and its application methods in the field. It is suggested that applying palm oil waste or compost is mainly performed by mulching. In contrast, new challenges for better processing to produce organic fertilizers and applicable technologies for sustainable waste management are recommended. The method must be affordable, efficient, and practical, combining compost quality with maximum nutrient recovery.","The authors would like to thank ANJ Research Center Library and Agricultural Science Department, Padjadjaran University, for the facility and technical support during the research work.

Although interactions between the soil microbiome and cover crops have been examined for annual cropping systems, there are critical differences in management and growth in perennial cropping systems that can influence the soil microbiome and, therefore, the response to cover crops. Here, we discuss the importance of cover crops in tree cropping systems using multispecies cover crop mixtures and minimum tillage and no-tillage to not only enhance the soil microbiome but also carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling compared to monocropping, conventional tillage, and inorganic fertilization. We also identify potentially important taxa and research gaps that need to be addressed to facilitate assessments of the relationships between cover crops, soil microbes, and the health of tree crops.

However, little is known about the impact of fire on soil nematode communities in terrestrial ecosystem. In the present study, we investigated the effects of short-term prescribed fire on soil nematode communities and soil properties in an old-field grassland in Northern China. The results showed that burning significantly increased soil nematode abundance by 77% and genus richness by 49% compared to the control. Burning also decreased taxon dominance by 45% (Simpson's D) and increased nematode diversity by 31% (Shannon-Weaver H'). However, burning increased plant parasites (particularly genera Cephalenchus and Pratylenchus) and shifted community to more bacterial-feeding genera (i.e., decreased Channel Index). Generally, burning increased soil bio-available nitrogen (NH4 +-N and NO3 --N) content, which would be the main drivers causing nematode community to flourish via a ""bottom-up"" effect. These results suggest that prescribed fire increases nematode diversity and alters community composition toward more plant parasites and bacterial feeders.

5729,pub.1134979418,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112008,33529883,,Carbon sequestration value of biosolids applied to soil: A global meta-analysis,"Biosolids produced at wastewater treatment facilities are extensively used in agricultural land and degraded mine sites to improve soil health and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Many studies have reported increases in SOC due to application of biosolids to such sites. However, lack of a comprehensive quantification on overall trends and changes of magnitude in SOC remains. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to identify drivers with a relationship with SOC stocks. A meta-regression of 297 treatments found four variables with a relationship with SOC stocks: cumulative biosolids carbon (C) input rate, time after application, soil depth and type of biosolids. The cumulative biosolids C input rate was the most influencing driver. The highest mean difference for SOC% of 3.3 was observed at 0-15 cm soil depth for a cumulative C input of 100 Mg ha-1 at one year after biosolids application. Although years after biosolids application demonstrated a negative relationship with SOC stocks, mineralization of C in biosolids-applied soils is slow, as indicated with the SOC% decrease from 4.6 to 2.8 at 0-15 cm soil depth over five years of 100 Mg ha-1 biosolids C input. Soil depth illustrated a strong negative effect with SOC stocks decreasing by 2.7% at 0-15 cm soil depth at a cumulative biosolids C input of 100 Mg ha-1 over a year. Overall, our model estimated an effect of 2.8 SOC% change, indicating the application of biosolids as a viable strategy for soil C sequestration on a global scale.","The authors would like to acknowledge the work carried out by the researchers whose published data were used for this meta-analysis and who provided and clarified their data whenever necessary.

However, the effects of soil properties on bioaccessibility still remains unclear. In this paper, 17 of the 1454 literatures with 474 samples were identified, screened and reviewed for exploring the correlation between soil physicochemical properties and lead bioaccessibility (BAcPb) through a meta-analysis approach. Five soil physicochemical parameters including pH, SOM, Clay, CEC and T-Pb were systematically analyzed using Principal component analysis, Pearson correlation analysis and survival analysis. The results showed that pH of simulated gastric juice is a major source of heterogeneity of the correlation between soil pH and BAcPb. In the gastric phase, the effect of alkaline soil on high BAcPb (BAc >50%) is more sensitive, and the effect of acidic soil on low BAcPb (BAc <50%) is more sensitive. However, in the small intestinal phase, soil pH displays little impacts on BAcPb in acidic, alkaline and neutral soils. Although three principal components explained 66.2% and 64.9% of the total variance of the urban, agricultural, and mining soils in gastric and small intestinal phases, respectively, there was no strong evidence that soil type can influence the BAcPb. The results of present study provide insights into the correlation between soil properties and BAcPb, and prediction of the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of Pb in different types of soil.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We conducted a meta-analysis considering these factors based on 42 experiments comparing carbon mineralization in the absence and presence of earthworms at different times. The results reveal an average carbon mineralization increase of 24% (sd 41%) in the presence of earthworms with an initial median earthworm density of 1.95 mg/g soil DM (Dry Mass) (sd 48%). We show that carbon mineralization due to earthworms was related to their density and time from inoculation. From a simple regression model using these two variables, the estimated impact of earthworms on carbon mineralization was 20% increase from 0 to 60 days and 14% decrease at day 350 for a density of worms commonly found in soils (0.5 mg/g soil DM). Finally, we proposed a simple equation that could be used in organic matter decomposition models that do not take macrofauna into account.","We thank Myriam Germain for her help in the statistical treatments.

However, information regarding the effects of fertilizer and irrigation management on the components of soil respiration (Rs) and the underlying microbial community characteristics in vineyard ecosystems remains limited. Therefore, a 2-year field experiment was conducted in a wine-grape vineyard (WGV) and a table-grape vineyard (TGV). Each vineyard included two fertilizer and irrigation regimes: farmers' practice (FP) and recommended practice (RP). The trenching method was employed to separate Rs into heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and autotrophic respiration (Ra). Additionally, the SOC storage and soil microbial community structure at 0-20 cm soil depth were determined after the 2-year experiment. The results showed that the fertilizer and irrigation regimes caused no effect on Ra. Compared with the FP treatment in WGV and TGV, the RP treatment significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the average daily Rh by 15.13 % and 17.11 %, which contributed to the annual Rs values at the whole-vineyard scale decreased by 8.93 % and 11.78 %, respectively. Besides, compared with the initial value, the SOC storage under RP treatment were effectively increased by 6.39 % and 6.33 % in WGV and TGV, respectively. Low annual total Rh was partially ascribed to the significant (P < 0.05) decline in Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes relative abundance, thus reducing the decomposition rate of SOC. Compared with WGV, the fertilizer and water input was higher in the TGV, which resulted in the annual total Rs and Rh values at the whole-vineyard scale was increased by 11.53 % and 15.74 %, respectively, while the annual total Ra was decreased by 18.83 % due to the lower grapevine density and more frequent summer pruning. Overall, RP treatment was found to be a suitable strategy for reducing soil C emissions and benefiting SOC storage in vineyards around North China.","This study was supported by the National Key R D Program of China (2017YFD0200106, 2018YFD0201307).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Carbon; China; Fertilizers; Microbiota; Respiration; Soil,2022-06-06,2022,2022-06-06,2022-09,840,,156469,Closed,Article,"Zhang, Jie; Ji, Yanzhi; Guo, Yanjie; Yin, Xing; Li, Yannan; Han, Jian; Liu, Yang; Wang, Chen; Wang, Wenzan; Liu, Yusha; Zhang, Lijuan","Zhang, Jie (College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding 071000, China; The Key Laboratory of agro ecological environment of Hebei Province, Baoding 071000, China.); Ji, Yanzhi (College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding 071000, China; The Key Laboratory of agro ecological environment of Hebei Province, Baoding 071000, China.); Guo, Yanjie (College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding 071000, China; The Key Laboratory of agro ecological environment of Hebei Province, Baoding 071000, China.

However, the long-term effects of such measures on soil N2O emission and the associated underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we sampled soils that were part of two long-term trials after eight years of different amounts and types of organic amendment addition, and investigated the response of soil N2O emissions to different types of mineral N addition under oxic condition. Further, we selected two soil samples with a large difference in SOC content and investigated the responses of soil CO2, N2O, NO, and N2 emissions as well as O2 consumption to NH4+, NO3-, and nitrification inhibitor addition under limited O2 diffusion condition and anoxic condition. Results showed that long-term organic amendments significantly increased SOC content, while the stimulated effect on N2O and N2 emissions owing to increased SOC contents was more pronounced with NH4+ addition under limited O2 diffusion condition than under oxic or anoxic conditions. Further, in all treatments under limited O2 diffusion condition, soil O2 concentration and N2O production showed significant inverse relationships, suggesting that O2 directly regulates N2O production. We speculated that the decrease in O2 availability with higher SOC contents owing to enhanced soil respiration, instead of the increased supply of electron donors, is primarily responsible for the stimulated N2O emissions. This implied that practices which reduce limited O2 diffusion conditions might help to minimize the stimulated N2O emissions from increased SOC content.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 41830751, 31861133018, 42077037) and the Hainan University Startup Fund (grant number KYQD(ZR)-2009).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Agriculture; Carbon; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil,2021-09-21,2021,2021-09-21,2022-02,806,Pt 1,150466,Closed,Article,"Wei, Huanhuan; Liu, Yan; Ju, Xiaotang; Wu, Di","Wei, Huanhuan (College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.); Liu, Yan (State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China.); Ju, Xiaotang (College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China; College of Tropical Crops, Hainan University, Haikou 570228, China.

Most P utilized by anthropogenic activities is released within the generation of various solid wastes such as sewage sludge, animal manure, and wetland plant, which increase the risk of water contamination. (Hydro)thermal treatment could be employed for solid waste treatment with the production of value-added hydro/bio-char, and the behavior of P during the thermochemical treatment process is critical for the further utilization of hydro/bio-char. This study provides a systematic review of the migration and transformation mechanisms of P during thermochemical treatment of various solid wastes, and special emphasis is given to the potential applications of P-enriched hydro/bio-char. Future challenges and perspectives in the thermal treatment of P-enriched solid waste are presented as well. The distribution and speciation of P were affected by feedstock properties, thermal technique, and reaction conditions, correspondingly affecting hydro/bio-char applications. The derived P-enriched hydro/bio-char was mainly applied as an agricultural soil amendment, P recovery source, and heavy metal sorbent, which could be adjusted by varying treatment process parameters. Additionally, potentially toxic substances, such as heavy metals in the solid waste, should be addressed during the production and application of hydro/bio-char. Overall, the production of P-enriched hydro/bio-char from solid waste is a promising route to simultaneously achieve P reclamation and solid waste treatment.","This study was, in part, supported by a grant from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42107237), National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFC1903905), Tianjin Science and Technology Committee (Grant No. 18YFHBZC00020), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51878557).",,Chemosphere,,,"Animals; Charcoal; Metals, Heavy; Sewage; Solid Waste",2022-04-15,2022,2022-04-15,2022-08,301,,134646,Closed,Article,"Chen, Guanyi; Wang, Junxia; Yu, Fan; Wang, Xutong; Xiao, Hui; Yan, Beibei; Cui, Xiaoqiang","Chen, Guanyi (School of Environmental Science and Engineering/ Tianjin Key Lab of Biomass Waste Utilization, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, China; School of Mechanical Engineering, Tianjin University of Commerce, Tianjin, 300134, China.); Wang, Junxia (School of Environmental Science and Engineering/ Tianjin Key Lab of Biomass Waste Utilization, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, China.); Yu, Fan (School of Environmental Science and Engineering/ Tianjin Key Lab of Biomass Waste Utilization, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, China.); Wang, Xutong (School of Environmental Science and Engineering/ Tianjin Key Lab of Biomass Waste Utilization, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, China.); Xiao, Hui (Tianjin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Tianjin, 300192, China.); Yan, Beibei (School of Environmental Science and Engineering/ Tianjin Key Lab of Biomass Waste Utilization, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, China.); Cui, Xiaoqiang (School of Environmental Science and Engineering/ Tianjin Key Lab of Biomass Waste Utilization, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, China.)","Cui, Xiaoqiang (Tianjin University)","Chen, Guanyi (Tianjin University; Tianjin University of Commerce); Wang, Junxia (Tianjin University); Yu, Fan (Tianjin University); Wang, Xutong (Tianjin University); Xiao, Hui (Tianjin Academy of Agricultural Sciences); Yan, Beibei (Tianjin University); Cui, Xiaoqiang (Tianjin University)",7,7,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147162593,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology,12 Responsible Consumption and Production

However, no relevant review study is available for East Asian countries which are responsible for 70% of gaseous N losses from croplands globally. This review analyzed data of the biochar-induced N2O mitigation affected by experimental conditions, including experimental types, biochar types and application rates, soil properties, and chemical forms and application rates of N fertilizer for East Asian countries. The magnitude of biochar-induced N2O mitigation was evaluated by calculating N2O reduction index (Rindex, percentage reduction of N2O by biochar relative to control). The Rindex was further standardized against biochar application rate by calculating Rindex per unit of biochar application rate (ton ha-1) (Unit Rindex). The Rindex averaged across different experimental types (n = 196) was -21.1 ± 2.4%. Incubation and pot experiments showed greater Rindex than column and field experiments due to higher biochar application rate and shorter experiment duration. Feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature also affected Rindex; either bamboo feedstock or pyrolysis at > 400 °C resulted in a greater Rindex. The magnitude of Rindex also increased with increasing biochar rate. Soil properties did not affect Rindex when evaluated across all experimental types, but there was an indication that biochar decreased N2O emission more at a lower soil moisture level in field experiments. The magnitude of Rindex increased with increasing N fertilizer rate up to 500-600 kg N ha-1, but it decreased thereafter. The Unit Rindex averaged across experimental types was -1.2 ± 0.9%, and it was rarely affected by experimental type and conditions but diminished with increasing biochar rate. Our results highlight that since N2O mitigation by biochar is affected by biochar application rate, Rindex needs to be carefully evaluated by standardizing against biochar application rate to suggest the best conditions for biochar usage in East Asia.","This study was carried out with the support of “Research Program for Agricultural Science Technology Development (Project No. PJ01261403)” of National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.

Amidst growing calls to reduce industrial ruminant production, there is room to consider differences in meat quality and nutritional benefits of organic and/or pasture-based management systems. Access to forage, whether fresh or conserved, is a key influencing factor for meat fatty acid profile, and there is increasing evidence that pasture access is particularly beneficial for meat’s nutritional quality. These composition differences ultimately impact nutrient supply to consumers of conventional, organic and grass-fed meat. For this review, predicted fatty acid supply from three consumption scenarios were modelled: i. average UK population National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) (<128 g/week) red meat consumption, ii. red meat consumption suggested by the UK National Health Service (NHS) (<490 g/week) and iii. red meat consumption suggested by the Eat Lancet Report (<98 g/week). The results indicate average consumers would receive more of the beneficial fatty acids for human health (especially the essential omega-3, alpha-linolenic acid) from pasture-fed beef, produced either organically or conventionally.",,The APC was funded by the University of Reading.,Foods,,María Del Mar Campo Arribas,,2022-02-23,2022,2022-02-23,,11,5,646,All OA; Gold,Article,"Davis, Hannah; Magistrali, Amelia; Butler, Gillian; Stergiadis, Sokratis","Davis, Hannah (School of Natural and Environmental Science, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE1 7RU, UK;, amelia.magistrali@newcastle.ac.uk, (A.M.);, gillian.butler@ncl.ac.uk, (G.B.)); Magistrali, Amelia (School of Natural and Environmental Science, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE1 7RU, UK;, amelia.magistrali@newcastle.ac.uk, (A.M.);, gillian.butler@ncl.ac.uk, (G.B.)); Butler, Gillian (School of Natural and Environmental Science, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE1 7RU, UK;, amelia.magistrali@newcastle.ac.uk, (A.M.);, gillian.butler@ncl.ac.uk, (G.B.)); Stergiadis, Sokratis (Department of Animal Sciences, School of Agriculture, Policy and Development, University of Reading, Reading RG6 6EU, UK)","Davis, Hannah (Newcastle University); Stergiadis, Sokratis (University of Reading)","Davis, Hannah (Newcastle University); Magistrali, Amelia (Newcastle University); Butler, Gillian (Newcastle University); Stergiadis, Sokratis (University of Reading)",19,19,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/11/5/646/pdf?version=1645615612,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145800298,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3003 Animal Production",12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 13 Climate Action; 2 Zero Hunger

Several modifiable environmental factors have been linked to gastric carcinogenesis but in many cases, evidence is either weak or fragmented. In this review, we interrogate the latest evidence implicating environmental factors in the development of gastric cancer.
RECENT FINDINGS: We are writing this review at a time when technological advancements are enabling scientists to effectively conduct large epidemiological studies with better tools for exposure estimations. We have highlighted risk factors that do not yet have enough evidence to be included as definite carcinogens in the International Agency for Research on Cancer monographs but have the potential for inclusion in the near future. Considered in our review are the links between gastric cancer and exposure to biomass smoke, particulate matter, occupational hazards and water contamination.
SUMMARY: This review illustrates the need for vigilance as evidence linking gastric cancer to various environmental factors is mounting. Many of these factors are modifiable, allowing for preventive strategies that could further decrease the global burden of gastric cancer.",,,Current Opinion in Gastroenterology,,,Carcinogenesis; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Risk Factors; Stomach Neoplasms,2021-12-28,2021,2021-12-28,2022-03,38,2,156-161,All OA; Green,Article,"Kayamba, Violet; Kelly, Paul","Kayamba, Violet (Tropical Gastroenterology and Nutrition Group, University of Zambia School of Medicine, Lusaka, Zambia); Kelly, Paul (Tropical Gastroenterology and Nutrition Group, University of Zambia School of Medicine, Lusaka, Zambia; Blizard Institute, Barts & The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK)",,"Kayamba, Violet (); Kelly, Paul (Queen Mary University of London)",1,1,,0.49,https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/76725,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144292770,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

Biochar remediation of heavy metal (HM)-contaminated soil primarily depends on the properties of the soil, biochar, and HM. The optimum conditions for HM immobilization in biochar-amended soils are site-specific and vary among studies. Therefore, a generalized approach to predict HM immobilization efficiency in biochar-amended soils is required. This study employs machine learning (ML) approaches to predict the HM immobilization efficiency of biochar in biochar-amended soils. The nitrogen content in the biochar (0.3-25.9%) and biochar application rate (0.5-10%) were the two most significant features affecting HM immobilization. Causal analysis showed that the empirical categories for HM immobilization efficiency, in the order of importance, were biochar properties > experimental conditions > soil properties > HM properties. Therefore, this study presents new insights into the effects of biochar properties and soil properties on HM immobilization. This approach can help determine the optimum conditions for enhanced HM immobilization in biochar-amended soils.","This work was carried out with the support of the Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development (Project No. PJ01475801) from Rural Development Administration, the Republic of Korea.

Recent investigations suggest that the stability of labile carbon inputs in soil mostly depends upon the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the surroundings. Here, we propose that, in some ecosystems, such as forests and grasslands, root exudates can function as a source of soil organic carbon (SOC) that can be stabilized through various mechanisms leading to long-term sequestration. Increasing soil carbon sequestration is important for capturing atmospheric CO2 and combating climate change issues. Thus, there is an urgent need to preserve existing ecosystems and to adopt strategies such as afforestation, reforestation, and establishment of artificial grasslands to foster carbon sequestration through higher root exudate inputs in the soil.","Acknowledgments P.P. acknowledges a research fellowship from UGC, India, a Newton Bhabha PhD placement fellowship from DBT, India, and the British Council, UK.

The aim of this paper is to develop a risk ranking of transmission of key pesticides through soil to waterways, taking into account physico-chemical properties of the pesticides (soil half-life and water solubility), soil permeability, and the relationship between adsorption of pesticides and soil texture. This may be used as a screening tool for land managers, as it allows assessment of the potential transmission risks associated with the use of specified pesticides across a spectrum of soil textures. The twenty-eight pesticides examined were differentiated into three groups: herbicides, fungicides and insecticides. The highest risk of pesticide transmission through soils to waterways is associated with soils containing <20% clay or >45% sand. In a small number of cases, the resulting transmission risk is not influenced by soil texture alone. For example, for Phenmedipham, the transmission risk is higher for clay soils than for silt loam. The data generated in this paper may also be used in the identification of critical area sources, which have a high likelihood of pesticide transmission to waterways. Furthermore, they have the potential to be applied to GIS mapping, where the potential transmission risk values of the pesticides can be layered directly onto various soil textures.","This project is funded under the Irish EPA Research Programme 2014‐2020 (Project reference number 2019‐HW‐LS‐3).

However, restoration benefits are often associated with time lags, as many attributes, such as leaf litter and coarse woody debris, need time to accumulate. Here, we experimentally tested whether adding mulch and logs to restoration sites in semi-arid Western Australia can accelerate restoration benefits. All sites had been cropped and then planted with native trees and shrubs (i.e., Eucalyptus, Melaleuca, and Acacia spp.) 10 years prior to our experiment, to re-establish the original temperate eucalypt woodland vegetation community. We used a Multi-site Before-After-Control-Impact (MBACI) design to test the effects on 30 abiotic and biotic response variables over a period of 2 years. Of the 30 response variables, a significant effect was found for just four variables: volumetric water content, decomposition, native herbaceous species cover and species richness of disturbance specialist ants. Mulch addition had a positive effect on soil moisture when compared to controls but suppressed growth of native (but not exotic) herbaceous plants. On plots with log additions, decomposition rates decreased, and species richness of disturbance specialist ants increased. However, we found no effect on total species richness and abundance of other ant species groups. The benefit of mulch to soil moisture was offset by its disbenefit to native herbs in our study. Given time, logs may also provide habitat for ant species that prefer concealed habitats. Indeed, benefits to other soil biophysical properties, vegetation, and ant fauna may require longer time frames to be detected. Further research is needed to determine whether the type, quantity, and context of mulch and log additions may improve their utility for old field restoration and whether effects on native herbs are correlated with idiosyncratic climatic conditions.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was funded by an Australian Postgraduate Award, a scholarship awarded to T.P. by Bush Heritage Australia as part of T.P.’s doctoral dissertation, and project funds provided by Carbon Neutral Pty Ltd, Bush Heritage Australia, with additional support from the Smart Farms Program of the Australian Government&#x27;s National Landcare Program.

This study aimed to explore the associations of PM2.5 constituents with glucose metabolism in rural areas, and to further specify the most responsible constituent.
METHODS: A total of 38,442 adults were recruited from the Henan Rural Cohort Study during 2015-2017. Three-year averaged concentrations of PM2.5 mass and its constituents (black carbon (BC), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), organic matter (OM), inorganic sulfate (SO42-), soil particles (SOIL) and sea salt (SS)) were estimated by a hybrid satellite-based model. Generalized linear model was applied to explore the associations of PM2.5 mass and its constituents with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin, and HOMA-β. Proportion and residual analyses were employed to specify the most responsible constituent.
RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for T2DM associated with 1 μg/m3 increase was 1.02 for PM2.5 mass, 1.28 for BC, 1.15 for NH4+, 1.08 for NO3-, 1.10 for OM, 1.11 for SO42-, and 1.12 for SOIL. Significant associations of PM2.5 mass and its constituents with elevated FBG, decreased insulin and HOMA-β were also observed. Proportion and residual analyses indicated that BC was the most responsible constituent, in which 1 percentage increment in the proportion of BC in PM2.5 corresponded with 1.51-fold risk for T2DM, 0.17 mmol/L increase in FBG, 2.18 μU/mL decrease in insulin, and 38.26 % decrease in HOMA-β; and 1 μg/m3 increment in the PM2.5-adjusted BC corresponded with 1.59-fold risk for T2DM, 0.53 mmol/L increase in FBG, 4.79 μU/mL decrease in insulin, and 91.32 % decrease in HOMA-β.
CONCLUSIONS: PM2.5 mass and its constituents (BC, NH4+, NO3-, OM, SO42-, SOIL) were associated with T2DM, increased FBG, decreased insulin and HOMA-β, of which BC was most responsible for these associations.

The impact of fertilization on N runoff loss often varies. A meta-analysis was performed using 245 observations from 31 studies in China, to estimate the response of N loss in both paddy and upland fields subjected to different fertilization strategies, and investigate the link between N runoffs, soil properties, as well as precipitation in the planting season. The results showed that compared to the control (without fertilization), N losses subjected to fertilization increased from 3.31 kg/ha to 10.03 kg/ha and from 3.00 kg/ha to 11.24 kg/ha in paddy and upland fields respectively. Importantly, paddy N loss was significantly correlated with fertilizer type and N application rate (predictors); in upland fields N application rate and seasonal precipitation were the main driving factors. For the N application rate, N loss increased with increase in rates for both paddies and upland fields. Moreover, the N loss from upland fields increased with the precipitation during planting season. Between the three fertilizers used in paddies, the increase in loss of CRF (controlled release fertilizer) or OF (organic fertilizer) was lower than that of CF (inorganic chemical fertilizer) with the lowest value in CRF. Subset analysis showed that the effect of CRF and OF in paddies was not affected by the predictors, revealing the steadily controlling property of CRF and OF in paddies. Also, all the predictors had an insignificant impact to N loss risk in paddies during the high application rate. Overall, the results confirm the importance of N dosage in N runoff loss from farmland. Fertilizer type is a key consideration for N loss control in paddies, while the seasonal precipitation should not be ignored in upland fields.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42077092), the National Key RD Program, Ministry of Science and Technology, China (2017YFD0300104, 2016YFD0801101), and Research Project of Ecological Environment in Jiangsu Province (JSZC-JC2020-053).

It consumes large quantities of freshwater, energy and chemicals, causing serious environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of cotton textiles have been studied extensively through various methods. However, little literature comprehensively summarizes current status of researches on environmental impact of cotton clothing comprehensively and identifies common problems to further study. To fill this gap, this study collates published results on the environmental performance of cotton clothing based on different environmental impact assessment methods, i.e., life cycle assessment, carbon footprint, and water footprint. Apart from the environmental impact results, this study also discusses the key issues when assessing the environmental impact of cotton textiles, such as data collection, carbon storage, allocation methods, and the environment benefits brought by recycling. In the production process of cotton textile products, there will be other co-products with economic value so that the environmental impact should be allocated. The economic allocation method is the most widely used method in the existing researches. In the future, considerable efforts are required to construct the accounting modules which consist of multiple modules, each representing a production process of cotton clothing and including an inventory of inputs under that process, such as cotton cultivation (water, fertilizer, pesticides), and spinning (electricity). It can ultimately be used to flexibly invoke one or more modules to calculate the environmental impact of cotton textiles. Moreover, returning carbonized cotton straw to the field can retain about 50 % of carbon, thus having a certain potential for carbon sequestration.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Here, I review studies on post-production processing methods and their effects on biochar physio-chemical properties and present a meta-analysis of plant growth and yield responses to post-processed vs. “raw” biochars. Data from 23 studies provide a total of 112 comparisons of responses to processed vs. unprocessed biochars, and 103 comparisons allowing assessment of effects relative to biochar particle size; additional 8 published studies involving 32 comparisons provide data on effects of biochar leachates. Overall, post-processed biochars resulted in significantly increased average plant growth responses 14% above those observed with unprocessed biochar. This overall effect was driven by plant growth responses to reduced biochar particle size, and heating/aeration treatments. The assessment of biochar effects by particle size indicates a peak at a particle size of 0.5–1.0 mm. Biochar leachate treatments showed very high heterogeneity among studies and no average growth benefit. I conclude that physiochemical post-processing of biochar offers substantial additional agronomic benefits compared to the use of unprocessed biochar. Further research on post-production treatments effects will be important for biochar utilization to maximize benefits to carbon sequestration and system productivity in agriculture, forestry, and environmental restoration.","I thank Sophie Cation for assistance with literature searches, and Nigel Gale, Wenxi Liao, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on the penultimate manuscript.

A range of effects have been observed from increases in IVBA Pb to almost 100% reduction. This study determined the mean change in IVBA Pb as a fraction of total Pb (AC) and relative to the IVBA Pb of the control soil (RC) with a random effects meta-analysis. Forty-four studies that investigated the ability of inorganic phosphate amendments to reduce IVBA Pb were identified through 5 databases. These studies were split into 3 groups: primary, secondary, and EPA Method 1340 based on selection criteria, with the primary group being utilized for subgroup analysis and meta-regression. The mean AC was approximately -12% and mean RC was approximately -25% for the primary and secondary groups. For the EPA Method 1340 group, the mean AC was -5% and mean RC was -8%. The results of subgroup analysis identified the phosphorous amendment applied and contamination source as having a significant effect on the AC and RC. Soluble amendments reduce bioaccessible Pb more than insoluble amendments and phosphoric acid is more effective than other phosphate amendments. Urban Pb contamination associated with legacy Pb-paint and tetraethyl Pb from gasoline showed lower reductions than other sources such as shooting ranges and smelting operations. Meta-regression identified high IVBA Pb in the control, low incubated soil pH, and high total Pb with the greater reductions in AC and RC. In order to facilitate comparisons across future remediation research, a set of minimum reported data should be included in published studies and researchers should use standardized in vitro bioaccessibility methods developed for P-treated soils. Additionally, a shared data repository should be created for soil remediation research to enhance available soil property information and better identify unique materials.","Although EPA contributed to this article, the research presented was not performed by or funded by EPA and was not subject to EPA’s quality system requirements.

In this review, we assess the effectiveness of biochar as a microbial carrier for agricultural and environmental applications. Biochar is enriched with organic carbon, contains nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium as nutrients, and has a high porosity and moisture-holding capacity. The large number of active hydroxyl, carboxyl, sulfonic acid group, amino, imino, and acylamino hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups are effective for microbial cell adhesion and proliferation. The use of biochar as a carrier of microbial inoculum has been shown to enhance the persistence, survival and colonization of inoculated microbes in soil and plant roots, which play a crucial role in soil biochemical processes, nutrient and carbon cycling, and soil contamination remediation. Moreover, biochar-based microbial inoculants including probiotics effectively promote plant growth and remediate soil contaminated with organic pollutants. These findings suggest that biochar can serve as a promising substitute for non-renewable substrates, such as peat, to formulate and deliver microbial inoculants. The future research directions in relation to improving the carrier material performance and expanding the potential applications of this emerging biochar-based microbial immobilization technology have been proposed.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Despite many individual studies on manure effects, a comprehensive overview of its consequences for a broad range of soil properties is lacking. Through a meta-analysis of 521 observations spanning the experiments from days after pulse addition up to 113 years with continues manure input, we quantified and generalized the average responses of soil biochemical properties depending on climate factors, management, soil, and manure characteristics. Large increase of pools with fast turnover (microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N): +88% and +84%, respectively) compared to stable organic matter pools (+27% for organic C, and +33% for total N) reflects acceleration of C and N cycles and soil fertility improvement. Activities of enzymes acquiring C-, energy-, N-, phosphorus- and sulfur were 1.3-3.3 times larger than those in soil without manure for all study durations included. Soil C/N ratio remained unaffected, indicating the stability of coupled C and N cycles. Microbial C/N ratio decreased, indicating a shift towards bacterial domination, general increase of C and N availability and acceleration of element cycling. Composted manure or manure without mineral fertilizers induced the greatest increase compared to non-composted manure or manure with mineral fertilizers, respectively, in most biochemical properties. The optimal manure application rate for adjusting proper soil pH was 25 Mg ha-1 year-1. Among manure types, swine manure caused the greatest increase of N-cycle-related properties: microbial N (+230%), urease (+258%) and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (+138%) activities. Manure application strategies should avoid P and N losses and pollution via runoff, leaching or gaseous emissions due to fast mineralization and priming of soil organic matter. In conclusion, manure application favors C accumulation and accelerates nutrient cycling by providing available organic substances and nutrients and thus increasing enzyme activities.","This study is supported by the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC; grant Nos: 41807091, 41772264), the Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection (Nos: SKLGP2020K014, SKLGP2018Z001) and the Applied Basic Research Programs of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province (Nos. 2019YJ0507, 18YYJC1745).

To accomplish this, we investigated the short-term effects of two organic materials and their derived biochars on maize growth, soil properties, and microbial community in fluvo-aquic and red soil with a pot experiment. Five treatments were applied to each soil, namely, the addition of straw, manure, straw-derived biochar, manure-derived biochar, and the control with no addition of any organic materials and biochar. Our results revealed that straw decreased the shoot biomass of maize in both soils, while straw-derived biochar, manure and manure-derived biochar increased it by 51.50, 35.47 and 74.95% in fluvo-aquic soil and by 36.38, 117.57 and 67.05% in red soil compared with the control, respectively. Regarding soil properties, although all treatments increased soil total organic carbon, straw and manure exhibited more pronounced effects on improving permanganate-oxidizable carbon, basal respiration, and enzyme activity compared with their derived biochars. Manure and its biochar had more significant effects on improving soil available phosphorus, whereas straw and its biochar exhibited more ameliorating effects on available potassium. Straw and manure consistently decreased bacterial alpha diversity (Chao1 and Shannon index) and altered bacterial community composition in the two soils by increasing the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidota and decreasing those of Actinobacteriota, Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteriota. More specifically, straw had a greater effect on Proteobacteria, whereas manure affected Firmicutes more. While straw-derived biochar had no effect on bacterial diversity and bacterial community composition in both soils, manure-derived biochar increased bacterial diversity in the fluvo-aquic soil and altered bacterial community composition in the red soil by increasing the relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota and decreasing that of Firmicutes. In summary, owing to the input of active organic carbon, straw and manure exhibited more pronounced short-term effects on soil enzyme activity and bacterial community compared with their derived biochar. Furthermore, straw-derived biochar was found to be a better option than straw in promoting maize growth and nutrient resorption, while the choice of manure and its biochar should be determined by the soil type.",,,Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2023-05-25,2023,2023-05-25,,14,,1174921,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yue, Xiaosong; Liu, Xing; Wang, Fei; Shen, Changwei; Zhang, Ying","Yue, Xiaosong (Henan Engineering Research Center of Biological Pesticide & Fertilizer Development and Synergistic Application, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, China); Liu, Xing (Henan Engineering Research Center of Biological Pesticide & Fertilizer Development and Synergistic Application, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, China); Wang, Fei (Henan Engineering Research Center of Biological Pesticide & Fertilizer Development and Synergistic Application, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, China); Shen, Changwei (Henan Engineering Research Center of Biological Pesticide & Fertilizer Development and Synergistic Application, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, China); Zhang, Ying (Henan Engineering Research Center of Biological Pesticide & Fertilizer Development and Synergistic Application, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, China)","Zhang, Ying (Henan Institute of Science and Technology)","Yue, Xiaosong (Henan Institute of Science and Technology); Liu, Xing (Henan Institute of Science and Technology); Wang, Fei (Henan Institute of Science and Technology); Shen, Changwei (Henan Institute of Science and Technology); Zhang, Ying (Henan Institute of Science and Technology)",1,1,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1174921/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158345541,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,
5711,pub.1152000375,10.1002/jsfa.12282,36260409,,Transforming agrifood systems in a win–win for health and environment: evidence from organic rice–duck coculture,"BACKGROUND: Rice-duck coculture is an ecological agricultural mode; however, the nutritional and environmental benefits of transforming from conventional rice monoculture to rice-duck coculture are unknown. Based on survey data and the life-cycle assessment approach, this study conducted a carbon footprint evaluation of conventional rice monoculture (CR), organic rice monoculture (OR), and organic rice-duck coculture (ORD) using different functional units.
RESULTS: The carbon footprint per hectare of ORD (7842 ± 284 kg CO2 eq ha-1 ) was slightly lower than that of CR (7905 ± 412 kg CO2 eq ha-1 ), while higher than that of OR (7786 ± 235 kg CO2 eq ha-1 ). Although the rice yield of ORD was slightly lower than that of CR, its nutrient density unit (NDU) did not decrease significantly due to the additional duck yield. Thus, the carbon footprint per NDU of ORD was significantly lower than that of OR by 24.3% (P < 0.05) and was 5.8% higher than that of CR, but this was not statistically significant. Due to the higher economic profits of ORD, its unit of carbon footprint per economic profit was significantly reduced (by 47.1-75.7%) compared with the other two farming modes, while the net ecosystem economic budget was significantly increased by 98.5-341.9% (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Transforming from a rice monoculture to a coculture system will contribute to a win-win situation for human health and environmental sustainability. This study highlighted the abundant nutritional output function of the rice-duck coculture and analyzed the urgency and necessity of transitioning from traditional agriculture to ecological agriculture from the production and consumption perspectives. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Project (2018YFD300804), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20210791), and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).

5710,pub.1148645431,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156713,35714747,,Current status of carbon neutrality in Chinese rice fields (2002–2017) and strategies for its achievement,"China has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 to address global climate change, and achieving carbon neutrality in rice fields is a vital component of this commitment. However, the current status of carbon neutrality in rice fields in China is unclear, and there are few feasible strategies to achieve its successful implementation. Therefore, this study calculated the net carbon sequestration rate (NCSR, i.e., carbon sequestration minus carbon emissions) of rice fields in China from 2002 to 2017 to clarify the carbon neutrality status of Chinese rice fields. Furthermore, the effects of field management measures, rice sown area, and rice yield on NCSR were analyzed to identify suitable carbon neutralization pathways in Chinese rice fields. Our findings indicated that the annual carbon sequestration rate in rice fields was lower than the carbon emissions, resulting in continuous net emissions of 195.49 Tg CO2-eq yr-1. The NCSR of paddy fields increased first and then decreased with increases in rice sown area and yield. Meta-analysis indicated that management measures such as water conservation and biochar significantly increased NCSR by ~5766.50 kg CO2-eq ha-1 yr-1 and 22,296.62 kg CO2-eq ha-1 yr-1, respectively. Our findings suggests that proper control of rice sown area and the adoption of reasonable field management measures (water conservation and biochar) can promote carbon neutrality in Chinese rice fields.","This research was funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2662020ZKPY014), the Major Projects of Technological Innovation in Hubei Province, China (2019ABA104), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2020M672373).

Climate change is predicted to increase extreme weather and precipitation events that can flush nutrients and organic matter from soils to streams and lakes. Here we report changes in stable isotopes (δ2H, δ13C, δ15N, or δ18O) of water, dissolved organic matter (DOM), seston, and zooplankton in a subalpine lake at short time resolution following an extreme precipitation event between early July to mid-August 2021. Water from excess precipitation and runoff remained in the lake epilimnion and coincided with increasing δ13C values of seston (-30 ‰ to -20 ‰), due to the input of carbonates and terrestrial organic matter. Particles settled into deeper lake layers after two days and contributed to the uncoupling of C and N cycling as the lake responded to this extreme precipitation event. Following the event, there was an increase in bulk δ13C values of zooplankton (from -35 ‰ to -32 ‰). Throughout this study, δ13C values of DOM remained stable throughout the water column (-29 ‰ to -28 ‰), while large isotopic fluctuations in DOM δ2H (-140 ‰ to -115 ‰) and δ18O (+9 ‰ to +15 ‰) values suggested DOM relocation and turnover. Integrating isotope hydrology, ecosystem ecology, and organic geochemistry offers an element-specific, detailed approach to investigating the impact of extreme precipitation events on freshwater ecosystems and particularly aquatic food webs.",Declaration of competing interest Travis B.

However, its long-term effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) pools within the aggregates and the relation between aggregates-associated SOC and soil CO2 emissions need further appraisal. This study evaluated the effects of 64 years of annual burning on SOC and N dynamics compared to annual mowing and undisturbed treatments in a grassland experiment established in 1950. Soils were sampled from four depths representing the upper 30 cm layer and fractionated into macroaggregates, microaggregates and silt + clay fractions. The macroaggregates were further fractionated into three occluded fractions. The SOC in the bulk soil and aggregates were correlated to soil CO2 effluxes measured under field conditions. Compared to the undisturbed treatment, annual burning decreased aggregates stability, SOC and N in the upper 30 cm layer by 8%, 5% and 12%, respectively. Grassland mowing induced greater aggregates stability than burning only in the upper 5 cm. Burning also decreased SOC in the large macroaggregates (e.g., 0-5 cm) compared to mowing and the undisturbed grasslands but proportionally increased the microaggregates and their associated SOC. Soil N associated with aggregates decreased largely following grassland burning, for example, by 8.8-fold in the microaggregates within the large macroaggregates at 20-30 cm compared to the undisturbed grassland. Burning also increased soil CO2 emissions by 33 and 16% compared to undisturbed and mowing, respectively. The combustion of fresh C and soil organic matter by fire is likely responsible for the low soil aggregation, high SOC and N losses under burned grassland. These results suggested a direct link between grass burning and SOC losses, a key component for escalating climate change severity. Therefore, less frequent burning or a rotation of burning and mowing should be investigated for sustainable grasslands management.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank the Water Research Commission, South Africa, for funding the fieldwork and laboratory analysis for this research (project number K5/2266).

Strong correlations among soil microbial composition, management practices, and microbially mediated processes have been previously shown. However, limited integration of the different parameters has hindered our understanding of agroecosystem functioning. Multivariate analyses of these systems allow simultaneous evaluation of the parameters and can lead to hypotheses on the microbial groups involved in specific nutrient transformations. In the present study, using a multivariate approach, we investigated the effect of microbial composition (16SrDNA sequencing) and soil properties in carbon mineralization (CMIN) (BIOLOG™, Hayward, CA, USA) across different management categories on coffee agroecosystems in Mexico. Results showed that (i) changes in soil physicochemical variables were related to management, not to region, (ii) microbial composition was associated with changes in management intensity, (iii) specific bacterial groups were associated with different management categories, and (iv) there was a broader utilization range of carbon sources in non-managed plots. The identification of specific bacterial groups, management practices, and soil parameters, and their correlation with the utilization range of carbon sources, presents the possibility to experimentally test hypotheses on the interplay of all these components and further our understanding of agroecosystem functioning and sustainable management.","This work constitutes part of the PhD research of KCE, who received a scholarship from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACyT, scholarship no. 443871) and extends thanks to the Doctorado en Ciencias Biomédicas, UNAM.

Fertilizers alter soil C and N availability, which can affect C balance. However, the impact of fertilizers on C balance in grassland restoration has been equivocal and warrants more research. We determined the direct and indirect effects of the addition of three levels of C (sucrose) (0, 60, and 120 kg C ha-1 yr-1), three levels of N (urea) (0, 50, and 100 kg N ha-1 yr-1), and a combination of C plus N at each of the levels on soil respiration (Rs) dynamics and C balance in an alpine meadow in northern Tibet (4700 m above sea level). This study was undertaken during the middle of the growing season in 2011-2012. The addition of C and/or N stimulated CO2 emission, which was 2-fold greater in 2011 (102-144 g C m-2) than in 2012 (43-54 g C m-2). The rate of Rs increased with the addition of N, but was not affected with the addition of C plus N. Microbial biomass C, dissolved organic C and inorganic N were the main drivers of Rs. We concluded that N addition stimulated Rs to a greater extent than C addition in the short term. The application of fertilizer in the restoration of degraded grassland should be re-considered.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The abundance of toxicological, mechanistic, and epidemiological evidence on arsenic enables a nuanced assessment of risk of bias in epidemiological studies of low-level arsenic, as opposed to a generic evaluation based only on standard principles. Important concepts in this context include 1) arsenic metabolism and mode of action for toxicity and carcinogenicity; 2) effects of confounding factors such as diet, health status including nutritional deficiencies, use of tobacco and other substances, and body composition; 3) strengths and limitations of various metrics for assessing relevant exposures consistent with the mode of action; and 4) the potential for bias in the positive direction for the observed dose-response relationship as exposure increases in the low-dose range. As an example, evaluation of a recent dose-response modeling using eight epidemiological studies of inorganic arsenic and bladder cancer demonstrated that the pooled risk estimate was markedly affected by the single study that was ranked as having a high risk of bias, based on the above factors. The other seven studies were also affected by these factors to varying, albeit lesser, degrees that can influence the apparent dose-response in the low-dose range (i.e., drinking water concentration of 65 µg/L or dose of approximately ≤1 µg/kg-day). These issues are relevant considerations for assessing health risks of oral exposures to inorganic arsenic in the U.S. population, and setting evidence-based regulatory limits to protect human health.","The authors thank Betty Dowd and Mary Becker for graphics assistance, and the peer reviewers for their many helpful comments which greatly improved the manuscript.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Toxicology,,,"Animals; Arsenic; Diet; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Epidemiologic Studies; Humans; Neoplasms; Nutritional Status; United States; Water Pollutants, Chemical",2021-04-24,2021,2021-04-24,2021-06,457,,152801,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Tsuji, Joyce S; Lennox, Kristin P; Watson, Heather N; Chang, Ellen T","Tsuji, Joyce S (Exponent, Bellevue, WA, USA.

This enrichment may alter microbial processes in soils in a way that would increase the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), thereby aggravating global climate change. This review focuses on the effects of N enrichment on methanogens and methanotrophs, which play a central role in the dynamics of CH4 at the global scale. We also address the effects of N enrichment on N2O, which is produced in soils mainly by nitrification and denitrification. Overall, N enrichment inhibits methanogenesis in pure culture experiments, while its effects on CH4 oxidation are more complicated. The majority of previous studies reported that N enrichment, especially NH4+ enrichment, inhibits CH4 oxidation, resulting in higher CH4 emissions from soils. However, both activation and neutral responses have also been reported, particularly in rice paddies and landfill sites, which is well reflected in our meta-analysis. In contrast, N enrichment substantially increases N2O emission by both nitrification and denitrification, which increases proportionally to the amount of N amended. Future studies should address the effects of N enrichment on the active microbes of those functional groups at multiple scales along with parameterization of microbial communities for the application to climate models at the global scale.",,,Microbial Ecology,,,Humans; Soil; Greenhouse Gases; Ecosystem; Nitrous Oxide; Fertilizers; Methane; Carbon Dioxide,2021-11-02,2021,2021-11-02,2022-11,84,4,945-957,Closed,Article,"Kang, Hojeong; Lee, Jaehyun; Zhou, Xue; Kim, Jinhyun; Yang, Yerang","Kang, Hojeong (School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea); Lee, Jaehyun (School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea); Zhou, Xue (School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea; College of Agricultural Science and Engineering, Hohai University, Nanjing, China); Kim, Jinhyun (School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea); Yang, Yerang (School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea)","Kang, Hojeong (Yonsei University)","Kang, Hojeong (Yonsei University); Lee, Jaehyun (Yonsei University); Zhou, Xue (Yonsei University; Hohai University); Kim, Jinhyun (Yonsei University); Yang, Yerang (Yonsei University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142325707,41 Environmental Sciences; 4101 Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation,13 Climate Action

In doing so, not only the total quantity of SOC but also the stability of SOC must be considered. Stability of SOC increases as a function of resistance to microbial decomposition or microbial substrate use efficiency through chemical, biological, and physical mechanisms including humification, hydrophobic moieties, molecular diversity, and formation of macroaggregates. One of the mechanisms that enhance stability confers changes in the distribution of C functional groups of SOM. To better understand and quantify how these changes are influenced by agricultural management practices, we collected 670 pairwise data from the body of literature that has evaluated changes in the distribution of C functional groups of SOM measured by solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy. The types of agricultural managements discussed herein include (1) fertilization, (2) tillage, (3) crop rotation, (4) grazing, and (5) liming practices. Our meta-analyses show that these practices modify the distribution of C functional groups of SOM. Fertilization practices were associated with increased O-alkyl groups. Tillage resulted in increases in the SOC consisted of aromatic and carbonyl groups. Crop rotations, especially legume-based rotations, were found to increase the proportion of aromatic groups. Although there are fewer publications on tillage and crop rotation than on fertilization practices, the distribution of C functional groups may be more influenced by crop rotation and tillage practices than fertilization management—and should be a focus of future research.","Yuki Audette, Katelyn Congreves, and Paul Voroney would like to acknowledge the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA New Direction Grant ND2018-3410), Grain Farmers of Ontario (Grant C2019AG02), and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC Discovery Grant 401267) for supporting this study.

However, little is known about how co-occurrence patterns, keystone taxa and functional gene assemblages relate to soil pH in the rice rhizosphere soils. Using shotgun metagenome analysis, the rice rhizosphere microbiome was investigated across 28 rice fields in east-central China. At higher pH sites, the taxonomic co-occurrence network of rhizosphere soils was more complex and compact, as defined by higher average degree, graph density and complexity. Network stability was greatest at medium pH (6.5 < pH < 7.5), followed by high pH (7.5 < pH). Keystone taxa were more abundant at higher pH and correlated significantly with key ecosystem functions. Overall functional genes involved in C, N, P and S cycling were at a higher relative abundance in higher pH rhizosphere soils, excepting C degradation genes (e.g. key genes involved in starch, cellulose, chitin and lignin degradation). Our results suggest that the rice rhizosphere soil microbial network is more complex and stable at higher pH, possibly indicating increased efficiency of nutrient cycling. These observations may indicate routes towards more efficient soil management and understanding of the potential effects of soil acidification on the rice rhizosphere system.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (020914380079) to Lin Yang and Jonathan Adams, Provincial Policy Guidance Program—Jiangsu ‘Hundred Talents Program’ (SBX2020010098) to Jonathan Miles Adams and ‘Study on monitoring and evaluation of farmland microbial diversity and its intervention and control’.

Due to the temporal-spatial variations of rainfall and landscapes, the relationships between soil erosion and sediment yield are complex and non-linear. Soil erosion processes and sediment yield at the watershed scale have attracted widespread attention; however, few systematic studies have been performed. In this study, a bibliometric analysis and visualization are used to understand the global research status of soil erosion and sediment yield at the watershed scale and provide a reference for researchers to establish future research directions. The USA and China were the most active contributors and had the most publications and active institutions, while Jean Poesen, D.E.

However, the in-situ effects of manure application on soil N2O emission from field trials (i.e. real-world conditions) and related mechanisms are poorly understood at the global scale. Here, we performed a meta-analysis using 262 field observations from 44 publications to assess the in-situ effects of manure application on soil N2O emission and factors regulating N2O emission (e.g., agricultural practices, manure characteristics and initial soil properties). Our analysis found that manure application significantly increased soil N2O emission in field trials. The largest N2O emissions were observed in soils from warm temperate climates, planted with upland non-leguminous crops and using raw manure. Notably, water-filled pore space (WFPS) significantly affected N2O emission; soils with 50-90% WFPS had the highest N2O emissions. Initial soil properties (e.g. pH, texture and organic carbon (C)) were generally not significant for predicting N2O emission, possibly due to changes in soil properties induced by manure additions. Manures with carbon: nitrogen ratios (C:N) of 10-15 and C contents of 100-300 g C kg-1 produced the lowest N2O emission. The net N2O emission factor (1.13%) resulting from manure application was similar to additions of synthetic N fertilizer (1.25%) and crop residues (1.06%), suggesting that manure application resulted in a similar N2O emission to other soil amendments. Our analysis provides a scientific basis for manure management options to minimize N2O emissions from animal waste disposal on agricultural lands globally.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41907106), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2019FZJD007), and the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2019YQ18).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,,2020-05-12,2020,2020-05-12,2020-09,733,,139390,All OA; Green,Article,"Xia, Fang; Mei, Kun; Xu, Yan; Zhang, Chi; Dahlgren, Randy A; Zhang, Minghua","Xia, Fang (School of Life Science, Shaoxing University, Huancheng West Road 508, Shaoxing 312000, China; Key Laboratory of Watershed Environmental Science and Health of Zhejiang Province, Wenzhou Medical University, China; Key Laboratory of Environment Remediation and Ecological Health (Zhejiang University), Ministry of Education, Hangzhou 310058, China.

The response of CO2 emissions to these changes differs under different hydroclimatic conditions. Here, this article used meta-analysis to synthesize data from Chinese coastal salt marshes, to analyze sensitivities for CO2 emissions, and then to assess the relative contributions of air temperature (Ta) and precipitation (Pre). This article used the ratio between potential evaporation (Ep) and Pre to divide Chinese coastal saltmarshes into water- (Ep/Pre > 1) and energy-limited regions (Ep/Pre ≤ 1). Results show that emissions are more sensitive to both Pre and Ta in water-limited regions (E¯ = 0.60 eV, slope = 0.37) than in energy-limited regions (E¯ = 0.23 eV, slope = 0.04). Comparing the relative effects of changes in Ta (△CO2 = 21.86 mg m-2 h-1) and Pre (△CO2 = 7.19 mg m-2 h-1) on CO2 emissions shows that warming contributes more to changes in CO2 emissions. The response of emissions to changes in Pre is asymmetric and shows that warmer and drier may have antagonistic effects, while warmer and wetter may have synergistic effects. There was a 2.15 mg m-2 h-1 change in emissions in energy-limited regions when Pre increased by 139.69 mm, and a decrease of -0.15 mg m-2 h-1 in emissions when Pre decreased by 1.28 mm in water-limited regions. Climate change has the greatest impact on Phragmites australis in CO2 emissions, especially under warmer and wetter conditions in energy-limited regions. This indicates that warming drives CO2 emissions, while changes in Pre (resulting in wetter or dryer conditions) can mitigate or strengthen CO2 emissions from coastal wetlands in China. This article offers a new perspective and suggests that differences in hydroclimatic conditions should be considered when discussing carbon emissions from coastal wetlands.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Conventional agriculture with nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications, however, is a key source of ammonia (NH3) emissions that cause severe haze pollution and impair human health. Organic and conservation agricultural (OCA) practices are thereby recommended to address these dual challenges; however, whether OCA provides cobenefits for both air quality and crop productivity is controversial. Here, we perform a meta-analysis and machine learning algorithm with data from China, a global hotspot for agricultural NH3 emissions, to quantify the effects of OCA on NH3 emissions, crop yields and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). We find that the effects of OCA depend on soil and climate conditions, and the 40-60% substitution of synthetic fertilizers with livestock manure achieves the maximum cobenefits of enhanced crop production and reduced NH3 emissions. Model forecasts further suggest that the appropriate application of livestock manure, straw return, and no-till could increase grain production up to 59.7 million metric tons (100% of straw return) and reduce maximum US$2.7 billion (60% substitution with livestock manure) in damage costs to human health from NH3 emissions by 2030. Our findings provide data-driven pathways and options for achieving multiple sustainable development goals and improving food systems and air quality in China.","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41905079, 51961125203, and 52078004), the Guangdong University Youth Innovation Talent Project (2020KQNCX066), and the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee (JCYJ20210324104604012).",,Environmental Science and Technology,,,Agriculture; Ammonia; Animals; China; Crop Production; Fertilizers; Humans; Livestock; Manure; Nitrogen; Soil,2022-02-11,2022,2022-02-11,2022-03-01,56,5,2977-2989,Closed,Article,"Xu, Peng; Li, Geng; Houlton, Benjamin Z.; Ma, Lin; Ai, Dong; Zhu, Lei; Luan, Bo; Zhai, Shengqiang; Hu, Shiyao; Chen, Anping; Zheng, Yi","Xu, Peng (School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518055, China); Li, Geng (Division of Environment and Sustainability, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, 999077, China; Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science, Function Hub, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511458, China; School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518055, China); Houlton, Benjamin Z.

Paddy soil is a significant carbon (C) sink, but its C sequestration potential has not been realized as the various driving factors are still not fully understood. We performed a 5-year paddy field experiment in southern China to estimate tillage effects on SOC accumulation and its relation with soil bacteria. The C input from rice residue, SOC content, CO2 flux, soil bacterial community composition, and predicted functions were analyzed. No-tillage (NT) increased (p < 0.05) rice residue C inputs (by 12.6 %-15.9 %), SOC (by 40 % at the surface soil layer compared with conventional tillage, CT), and CO2 fluxes compared with reduced tillage (RT) and CT. Also, NT significantly altered the soil bacterial community. The random forest model showed that the predicted bacterial functions of ""Degradation/Utilization/Assimilation Other"", ""C1 Compound Assimilation"", and ""Amin and Polyamine Degradation"" were the most important functions associated with SOC accumulation. Analysis of metabolic pathway differences indicated that NT significantly decreased the BENZCOA-PWY (anaerobic aromatic compound degradation) and the AST-PWY (L-arginine degradation II). Therefore, the rapid paddy SOC increase is associated with both residue C input (from higher rice yields) and the degradation functions regulated by soil bacteria.",The Guangzhou Science and Technology Project (202103000075 and 202102100008) funded this research.

Analysis of the experimental conditions reported in the literature demonstrated that though batch-sorption studies have value, they are limited in evaluating partitioning under environmentally-relevant conditions. Recommendations are made to utilise environmental relevant pharmaceutical concentrations, perform batch-sorption studies at temperatures other than 4, 20 and 25 °C to better reflect climate diversity, and utilise the Guideline 106 methodology as a benchmark to enable comparison between future studies (and support modelling and prediction). The meta-dataset comprised 82 data points, which were modelled using multivariate analysis; where Kd (soil/water partitioning coefficient) was the independent variable. The dependent variables fit into three categories: 1) pharmaceutical studied (including physical-chemical properties), 2) soil characteristics and 3) experimental conditions. The pharmaceutical solubility, the soil/liquid equilibration time (prior to adding the pharmaceutical), the soil organic carbon, the soil sterilisation method and the liquid phase were found to be significantly important variables for predicting Kd.","The author (AGJ, CVU: 748280) gratefully acknowledges the Mexican National Science and Technology Council (CONACyT) for her PhD scholarship.

The influencing mechanism of biochar-based material on soil organisms is a key aspect for quantifying and predicting its benefits and trade-offs. This work focuses on the effects of biochar-based materials on soil organisms within the past ten years. 206 sources are reviewed and available knowledge on biochar-based materials' impacts on soil organisms is summarized from a diverse perspective, including the pollutant bioavailability changes in soil, and potential effects of biochar-based materials on soil organisms. Herein, effects of biochar-based materials on the bioavailability of soil organic pollutants are detailed, from the perspective of plant, microorganism, and soil fauna. Potential biological effects of pristine biochar (PBC), metal/metal compounds-biochar composites (MBC), clay minerals-biochar composites (CMBC), and carbonaceous materials-biochar composites (CBC) on soil organisms are highlighted for the first time. And possible mechanisms are presented based on the different characters of biochar-based materials as well as various environmental interactions. Finally, the bottleneck and challenges of risk assessment of biochar-based materials as well as future prospects are proposed. This work not only promotes the development of risk assessment system of biochar-based materials, but broadens the strategy for the design and optimization of environmental-friendly biochar materials.","This study was financially supported by the Program for the National Program for Support of Top-Notch Young Professionals of China (2014), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51521006, U20A20323, 51809090, 51378190), the Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Plan Project (No.2016RS3026, 2017SK2243, 2018SK20410), the Three Gorges Follow-up Research Project (2017HXXY-05), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-13-0186), the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China (Grant Nos. 2019JJ50077), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (531119200086, 531118010114, 531107050978, 541109060031), and the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (IRT-13R17).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Biological Availability; Charcoal; Environmental Pollutants; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Soil; Soil Pollutants,2022-02-19,2022,2022-02-19,2022-06,826,,153956,Closed,Article,"Lin, Qing; Tan, Xiaofei; Almatrafi, Eydhah; Yang, Yang; Wang, Wenjun; Luo, Hanzhuo; Qin, Fanzhi; Zhou, Chengyun; Zeng, Guangming; Zhang, Chen","Lin, Qing (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hunan University and Key Laboratory of Environmental Biology and Pollution Control (Hunan University), Ministry of Education, Changsha 410082, PR China; Center of Research Excellence in Renewable Energy and Power Systems, Center of Excellence in Desalination Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering-Rabigh, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.); Tan, Xiaofei (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hunan University and Key Laboratory of Environmental Biology and Pollution Control (Hunan University), Ministry of Education, Changsha 410082, PR China; Center of Research Excellence in Renewable Energy and Power Systems, Center of Excellence in Desalination Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering-Rabigh, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.); Almatrafi, Eydhah (Center of Research Excellence in Renewable Energy and Power Systems, Center of Excellence in Desalination Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering-Rabigh, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.); Yang, Yang (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hunan University and Key Laboratory of Environmental Biology and Pollution Control (Hunan University), Ministry of Education, Changsha 410082, PR China.); Wang, Wenjun (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hunan University and Key Laboratory of Environmental Biology and Pollution Control (Hunan University), Ministry of Education, Changsha 410082, PR China.); Luo, Hanzhuo (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hunan University and Key Laboratory of Environmental Biology and Pollution Control (Hunan University), Ministry of Education, Changsha 410082, PR China.); Qin, Fanzhi (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hunan University and Key Laboratory of Environmental Biology and Pollution Control (Hunan University), Ministry of Education, Changsha 410082, PR China.); Zhou, Chengyun (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hunan University and Key Laboratory of Environmental Biology and Pollution Control (Hunan University), Ministry of Education, Changsha 410082, PR China; Center of Research Excellence in Renewable Energy and Power Systems, Center of Excellence in Desalination Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering-Rabigh, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.); Zeng, Guangming (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hunan University and Key Laboratory of Environmental Biology and Pollution Control (Hunan University), Ministry of Education, Changsha 410082, PR China; Center of Research Excellence in Renewable Energy and Power Systems, Center of Excellence in Desalination Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering-Rabigh, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.

Here, through a comprehensive life-cycle assessment using data from China, we show that an integrated biomass pyrolysis and electricity generation system coupled with commonly applied methane and nitrogen mitigation measures can help reduce staple crops’ life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions from the current 666.5 to −37.9 Tg CO2-equivalent yr−1. Emission reductions would be achieved primarily through carbon sequestration from biochar application to the soil, and fossil fuel displacement by bio-energy produced from pyrolysis. We estimate that this integrated system can increase crop yield by 8.3%, decrease reactive nitrogen losses by 25.5%, lower air pollutant emissions by 125–2,483 Gg yr−1 and enhance net environmental and economic benefits by 36.2%.

However, a quantitative understanding of N oxide emissions related to different fertilizer regimes and the main controlling factors is lacking. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of 56 peer-reviewed publications on N oxide emissions from global tea gardens over the past three decades. Overall, fertilization increased N2O and NO emissions (p < 0.001) by 584 % and 790 %, respectively. The stimulating effect of fertilizer on N2O and NO emissions was mainly related to high N application rates. Furthermore, organic fertilizer treatment, combined fertilizer treatment, biochar amendment, and inhibitor amendment reduced N2O emissions (p < 0.05) by 63 %, 64 %, 69 %, and 94 %, respectively, relative to chemical fertilizer treatment. For NO emissions, only biochar amendment decreased fertilizer-driven stimulation (by 80 %, p < 0.05). Notably, the dominant factors that influenced fertilizer-induced N2O and NO emissions in tea gardens were fertilization regimes, climatic conditions, and soil properties. On a global scale, fertilization increased mean N2O and NO emissions (p < 0.05) from global tea gardens by 44.5 Gg N yr-1 and 34.3 Gg N yr-1, respectively, whereas compared with no amendment application, inhibitors reduced N2O emissions (p < 0.05) by 32.2 Gg N yr-1 and biochar reduced NO emissions (p < 0.05) by 23.6 Gg N yr-1. Our results suggest that to obtain maximum ecological and economic benefits, appropriate N fertilizer and biochar and inhibitor amendments should be applied for site-specific mitigation purposes, and long-term, multiarea, in situ experiments and microbial mechanism studies should be conducted.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42021005, 42077036), and Ningbo Municipal Science and Technology Bureau (2021Z047).

However, these chemicals are associated with several environmental impacts, demanding urgent remediation techniques. Biochar is a carbonaceous material produced by pyrolysis that has the potential for pesticide sorption and remediation. In this context, this interdisciplinary review systematically assessed the state of the knowledge of crop residues to produce biochar for pesticide sorption. We focused on maize, rice, and wheat residues since these are the three most-produced grains worldwide. Besides, we evaluated different biochar handling, storage, and soil dispersion techniques to ease its implementation in agriculture. In general, pyrolysis temperature influences biochar characteristics and its potential for pesticide sorption. Furthermore, biochar amended soils had greater pesticide sorption capacity, limiting potential leaching and runoff. Most studies showed that the feedstock and specific surface area influence the biochar sorption properties, among other factors. Also, biochar reduces pesticides' bioavailability, decreasing their toxicity to soil organisms and improving soil fertility and crop yields. Nonetheless, the retrieved papers assessed only 21 pesticides, mainly consisting of lab-scale batch experiments. Therefore, there is still a gap in studies evaluating biochar aging, its potential desorption, pesticide co-contaminations, the associated microbiological processes, and field applications. Determining flow properties for biochars of different sizes and pellets is vital for reliable handling equipment design, and performing techno-economic assessment under different farm contexts is encouraged. Ultimately, coupling biochar production with residue management could address this challenge on sustainable agricultural systems.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,This work was supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) Process 2015/18790-3; A.P.O and J.P.M. have a Ph.D. scholarship from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) Processes 140411/2018-6 and 140024/2019-5; J.Z.L. has a Ph.D. scholarship from FAPESP Process 2017/16961-0.,Journal of Environmental Management,,,Adsorption; Charcoal; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Oryza; Pesticides; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Triticum; Zea mays,2021-09-16,2021,2021-09-16,2021-12,300,,113753,All OA; Green,Article,"Ogura, Allan Pretti; Lima, Jacqueline Zanin; Marques, Jéssica Pelinsom; Massaro Sousa, Lucas; Rodrigues, Valéria Guimarães Silvestre; Espíndola, Evaldo Luiz Gaeta","Ogura, Allan Pretti (PPG-SEA and NEEA/CRHEA/SHS, São Carlos School of Engineering, University of São Paulo, São Carlos, SP, 13560-970, Brazil.

Changes in abiotic conditions associated with frequent or prolonged drought may disrupt these interactions, but the effects of disruption on invasive plant performance and the underpinning mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we used rainout shelters in an experimental field setting to test the hypothesis that drought reduces invasive plant performance by reducing microbial metabolic activity, resulting in decreased nitrogen flow to plants. We imposed growing season drought on populations of the exotic grass Microstegium vimineum, a widespread invasive plant in eastern deciduous forests, and quantified effects on aboveground and belowground biomass, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling among plants, decomposers, and soil. Drought resulted in a 24% decrease in soil respiration, a 16% decrease in phenol oxidase enzyme activity, a 12% decrease in dissolved organic N concentration, and a decrease in the C:N ratio of particulate organic matter, suggesting reduced microbial metabolic activity and nutrient mining of soil organic matter. Drought also reduced aboveground Microstegium biomass 33% and increased Microstegium leaf C:N ratio, consistent with a decline in plant N uptake. We conclude that drought can reduce the performance of existing invasive species populations by suppressing plant–microbe interactions that increase nitrogen supply to plants, which may have consequences for the persistence of invasive plants under hydrologic change.","We thank C.

However, few studies have examined the response of soil nitrogen (N) distribution in the soil profile and subsoil N recovery to the long-term planting and incorporation of deep-rooted GM. Based on a 12-year (2009−2021) experiment of spring maize-winter GMs rotation in the North China Plain (NCP), this study investigated the effects of different GMs that were planted over the winter, including ryegrass (RrG, Lolium L.) (>1.0 m), Orychophragmus violaceus (OrV, Orychophragmus violaceus L.) (>0.8 m), and hairy vetch (VvR, Vicia villosa Roth.) (>1.0 m), on the spring maize yield, N distribution in the deep soil profile, N use efficiencies, functional gene abundances involving soil nitrification−denitrification processes and N2O production. Compared with the winter fallow, the maize yield significantly increased by 11.6% after 10 years of green manuring, and water storage in 0−200 cm soil profile significantly increased by 5.0−17.1% at maize seedling stage. The total N content in the soil layer at 0−90 cm increased by 15.8−19.7%, while the nitrate content in the deep soil layer (80−120 cm) decreased by 17.8−39.6%. Planting GM significantly increased the N recovery rate (10.4−32.7%) and fertilizer N partial productivity (4.6−13.3%). Additionally, the topsoil N functional genes (ammonia-oxidizing archaea amoA, ammonia-oxidizing bacterial amoA, nirS, nirK) significantly decreased without increasing N2O production potential. These results indicated that long-term planting of the deep-rooted GM effectively reduce the accumulation of nitrates in the deep soil and improve the crop yield and N use efficiencies, demonstrating a great value in green manuring to improve the fertility of the soil, increase the crop yield, and reduce the risk of N loss in NCP.",,The study was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFD1700200) and the Earmarked Fund for Modern Agro-Industry Technology Research System-Green Manure (CARS-22).,Plants,,Tim L.

In particular, numerous studies suggest severe consequences for the health of crop plants, affecting both the productivity and quality of raw material destined to the food industry. Of particular concern is the reduction of proteins and essential micronutrients as iron and zinc in crops. Fighting this alarming trends is the challenge of Climate-Smart Agriculture with the double goal of reducing environmental impacts (use of pesticides, nitrogen and phosphorus leaching, soil erosion, water depletion and contamination) and improving raw material and consequently food quality. Organic farming, biofertilizers and to a lesser extent nano-carriers, improve the antioxidant properties of fruits, but the data about proteins and micronutrients are rather contradictory. On the other hand, advanced devices and Precision Agriculture allow the cultivations to be more profitable, efficient, contributing more and more to reduce pest diseases and to increase the quality of agricultural products and food safety. Thus, nowadays adoption of technologies applied to sustainable farming systems is a challenging and dynamic issue for facing negative trends due to environmental impacts and climate changes.","The authors thank Prof. Francesco Visioli, University of Padua (Italy) for the critical review of the manuscript and for useful suggestions.",The work was funded by AGER Fondazioni in Rete per la Ricerca Agroalimentare grant n° 2017-2194.,Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition,,,"Agriculture; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Food Quality; Organic Agriculture",2020-04-09,2020,2020-04-09,2021-03-26,61,6,971-981,Closed,Article,"Agrimonti, Caterina; Lauro, Marta; Visioli, Giovanna","Agrimonti, Caterina (Department of Chemistry, Life Sciences and Environmental Sustainability, University of Parma, Parma, Italy); Lauro, Marta (Department of Chemistry, Life Sciences and Environmental Sustainability, University of Parma, Parma, Italy); Visioli, Giovanna (Department of Chemistry, Life Sciences and Environmental Sustainability, University of Parma, Parma, Italy)","Visioli, Giovanna (University of Parma)","Agrimonti, Caterina (University of Parma); Lauro, Marta (University of Parma); Visioli, Giovanna (University of Parma)",46,33,3.61,10.87,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126394784,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences",13 Climate Action; 2 Zero Hunger

Ecosystem processes in the dryland biome, which makes up over 40% of Earth's terrestrial surface, are often distinctively sensitive to small changes in resource availability, likely because levels of many resources are low. However, data also suggest that simultaneous changes in the availability of multiple resources may be necessary to affect a response in these low-resource systems, offering an opportunity to test patterns and controls of co-limitation, serial limitation, and individual limitation in soil environments. While drylands may play a governing role in key aspects of Earth's C cycle, and while an improved understanding of resource limitation could substantially improve our forecasts of dryland responses to change, our understanding of interacting controls on soil C cycle processes remains notably poor in these dry systems. Here, we address multiple fundamental hypotheses of resource controls over ecosystem function to test how water, C, N, and P regulate soil C cycling individually and interactively in a dryland ecosystem on the Colorado Plateau. Using a series of laboratory incubations, we found that, while water, C, and N limited C cycling through serial limitation, water alone resulted in an extremely small respiratory response from target organisms, whereas water + C resulted in a dramatic increase in soil C cycling, suggesting a degree of functional co-limitation. Nitrogen additions alone resulted in no changes to soil C cycling, but when N was added in concert with water and C, N greatly increased soil C cycling rates relative to additions of water and C without N. Phosphorus additions had no effect on the C cycle either alone or synergistically. These patterns were consistent with the stoichiometry of the system and interactions among resources were surprising in ways that inform our understanding of critical theories in ecology, such as the Transient Maxima Hypothesis, supporting the suggestion that multiple resource limitation explains pulse-dynamic C cycling in drylands better than water limitation alone.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank the National Park Service Southeast Utah Group for help with permits and logistics.

However, to provide crop and soil-specific guidelines about using these NIs, a quantitative assessment of their efficacy in mitigating gaseous emissions, worth for nitrate leaching, and improving crop productivity under different crops and soils is yet required. Therefore, based upon 146 peer-reviewed research studies, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the effect of DCD and DMPP on gaseous emissions, nitrate leaching, soil inorganic N, and crop productivity under different variates. The efficacy of the NIs in reducing the emissions of CO2, CH4, NO, and N2O highly depends on the crop, soil, and experiment types. The comparative efficacy of DCD in reducing N2O emission was higher than the DMPP under maize, grasses, and fallow soils in both organic and chemical fertilizer amended soils. The use of DCD was linked to increased NH3 emission in vegetables, rice, and grasses. Depending upon the crop, soil, and fertilizer type, both the NIs decreased nitrate leaching from soils; however, DMPP was more effective. Nevertheless, the effect of DCD on crop productivity indicators, including N uptake, N use efficiency, and biomass/yield was higher than DMPP due to certain factors. Moreover, among soils, crops, and fertilizer types, the response by plant productivity indicators to the application of NIs ranged between 35 and 43%. Overall, the finding of this meta-analysis strongly suggests the use of DCD and DMPP while considering the crop, fertilizer, and soil types.Graphical Abstract",,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,"Gases; Dimethylphenylpiperazinium Iodide; Nitrification; Phosphates; Fertilizers; Nitrates; Soil; Nitrogen; Poaceae; Crops, Agricultural; Nitrous Oxide; Agriculture",2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,2023-05,30,23,64719-64735,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Tufail, Muhammad Aammar; Irfan, Muhammad; Umar, Wajid; Wakeel, Abdul; Schmitz, Ruth A.","Tufail, Muhammad Aammar (Institute for Microbiology, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany); Irfan, Muhammad (Soil and Environmental Sciences Division, Nuclear Institute of Agriculture (NIA), Tandojam, Pakistan); Umar, Wajid (Institute of Environmental Science, Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences, 2100, Gödöllő, Hungary); Wakeel, Abdul (Institute of Soil and Environmental Sciences, University of Agriculture Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan); Schmitz, Ruth A.

Additionally, BAC application significantly decreased the bioavailability of cadmium (-58.3 %), lead (-50.1 %), and zinc (-87.3 %). However, the bioavailability of copper increased by 30.1 %. The study explored the key factors regulating the response of PP to BAC through subgroup analysis. It was found that the increase in the organic matter content of the soil was the key mechanism for PP improvement. The recommended rate of BAC application for improving PP was found to be between 10 and 20 t ha-1. Overall, the findings of this study are significant in providing data support and technical guidance for the application of BAC in agricultural production. However, the high heterogeneity of BAC application conditions, soil properties, and plant types suggests that site-specific factors should be considered when applying BAC to soils.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Oxidized biochar has great potential to mitigate N losses due to its strong adsorption capacity; however, the effects of oxidized biochar in different soils treated with slurry are currently unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of untreated and oxidized biochar (applied at a rate of 50 kg C m-3 slurry) on reducing N losses in a laboratory experiment with three different soils (loamy sand, sandy loam, loam) amended with cattle slurry at an application rate of 73 kg N ha-1 . Oxidized biochar reduced NH3 emissions by 64-75% in all soils, whereas untreated biochar reduced NH3 emissions by 61% only in the loamy sand. Oxidized biochar significantly reduced the NO3 - content in the soil solution of the loamy sand in the early phase of the incubation and led to a significantly higher NO3 - concentration in the same soil compared with the slurry-only treatment at the end of the experiment, indicating a significant increase in NO3 - retention in this organic C-poor soil. We conclude that oxidized biochar can reduce N losses, both in the form of NH3 emission and NO3 - leaching, from cattle slurry applied to soil, particularly in soil with soil organic carbon content <1% and pH <5 (i.e., oxidized biochar can serve as a means for improving the quality of marginal and acidic soils).","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was conducted as part of the INPLAMINT project of the BonaRes initiative, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, FKZ 031B0508A), and supported by the Chinese Scholarship Council (scholarship no. 201706340157).

However, there is no clear report about how biochar remains a NET when organic amendment application in rice paddy results in a huge emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) particularly, methane (CH4). To evaluate the net impact of biochar application on the net global warming potential (GWP) in rice paddy, no organic amendment (control), fresh manure, compost, and biochar treatments were selected during the whole investigation period. Compared to compost, biochar application decreased annual CH4 and N2O emissions by 55 and 31 %, respectively. In comparison to the control, biochar application increased CH4 emission by 163 % but decreased N2O emission by 19 %. Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock would annually deplete by 2.2 Mg C ha-1 under control; however, biochar application could increase the SOC stock by 18.1 Mg C ha-1 which was 63 and 33 % higher than fresh and compost treatments, respectively. As a result, the control had a net GWP of 10 Mg CO2-eq ha-1 however, this impact was increased with fresh manure and compost application by around 319 and 159 %, respectively. Interestingly, biochar application converted rice paddy into a C sink having a net GWP of -0.104 to -0.191 Mg CO2-eq ha-1. Since there was a comparable difference in grain yield among organic amendments, greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) which is the net GWP per grain yield was significantly high in compost application of approximately 3.1 Mg CO2-eq Mg-1 grain being 127 % higher than control. However, the biochar application had a -0.02 Mg CO2-eq Mg-1 grain which was 1.4 Mg CO2-eq Mg-1 grain lower than the control. Conclusively, biochar application could be a considerable option in maintaining soil quality and productivity without contributing any GHG emissions and their associated impacts.",This work was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2015R1A6A1A03031413).

Integrating multiple facets of biodiversity (e.g., taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional biodiversity) may advance our understanding on how community assembly processes drive the distribution of biodiversity. In this study, plant communities in 60 sampling plots in desert ecosystems were investigated. The effects of local environment and spatial factors on the species, functional, and phylogenetic α- and β-diversity (including turnover and nestedness components) of desert plant communities were investigated. The results showed that functional and phylogenetic α-diversity were negatively correlated with species richness, and were significantly positively correlated with each other. Environmental filtering mainly influenced species richness and Rao quadratic entropy; phylogenetic α-diversity was mainly influenced by dispersal limitation. Species and phylogenetic β-diversity were mainly consisted of turnover component. The functional β-diversity and its turnover component were mainly influenced by environmental factors, while dispersal limitation dominantly effected species and phylogenetic β-diversity and their turnover component of species and phylogenetic β-diversity. Soil organic carbon and soil pH significantly influenced different dimensions of α-diversity, and soil moisture, salinity, organic carbon, and total nitrogen significantly influenced different dimensions of α- and β-diversity and their components. Overall, it appeared that the relative influence of environmental and spatial factors on taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity differed at the α and β scales. Quantifying α- and β-diversity at different biodiversity dimensions can help researchers to more accurately assess patterns of diversity and community assembly.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region university scientific research project (XJEDU2020I002) and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Graduate Research and Innovation Project (XJ2020G011).

Thus, limited irrigation strategies and soil amendments are promising strategies for conserving water in arid and semi-arid crop production. Soil amendments, such as compost and biochar can improve soil water relationships, nitrogen (N) fixation, soil fertility, and crop productivity. A study was designed to evaluate the effect of biochar and compost applications on soil water relationships, nutrient uptake, plant growth, and N-fixation. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted in two soils using a complete factorial design. The main effect, i.e., water content of each soil, was maintained at either 40% or 60% water filled porosity. The sub-effect, organic amendment type, was applied as biochar or compost. The sub-sub effect was rate of application (0, 5, and 10 Mg ha-1). Plant height and root length were significantly affected by the rate of amendment applied, whereas shoot and root mass differences were explained by irrigation strategy. Whole plant N uptake was moderately affected by water content only (p = 0.0818). Phosphorus and Potassium uptake were highly affected by amendment type and rate. Biochar moderately improved plant available water (0.061 %Vol Mg-1 ha-1) over the range of 0-20 Mg ha-1 in the sandier soil. Compost did not improve plant available water in either soil. Nodulation was affected by soil type only.

A three-year field manipulation experiment with warming (+2 °C above ambient temperature) and increased precipitation (+15% and +30% above ambient precipitation) was conducted in an alpine grassland to investigate the response of soil organic matter (SOM) to future climate change on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Labile-fraction SOM (LF-SOM) fingerprints were characterized by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/tandem-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS/MS), and organic compounds in LF-SOM were used as indicators to quantify the contributions of vegetation input and microbial degradation to LF-SOM transformation. Increased precipitation promoted LF-SOM accumulation, which were mainly due to the positive effect of increased precipitation on vegetation productivity. Plant-derived compounds in LF-SOM (including lignin, long-chain alkyl compounds, polysaccharides and phenols) were more sensitive to increasing soil moisture than microbial-derived (including short-chain alkyl compounds, N compounds and chitin) and aromatic-derived compounds (including aromatics and polyaromatics). In contrast, warming alone intensified the effect of drought on the alpine grassland, which had negative effects on both vegetation and microorganisms and reduced LF-SOM. Warming plus increased precipitation not only alleviated the water loss caused by warming but also increased soil temperature, which was more favorable for the growth of microorganisms. This was reflected in the increase in microbial-derived compounds in LF-SOM with increasing soil temperature, which contributed to LF-SOM degradation. Aromatic-derived compounds, as refractory compounds in soil, showed no significant response to either warming or increased precipitation treatments. Acidobacteria (approximately 25%) and Actinobacteria (approximately 20%), as the dominant soil bacterial communities in the alpine grassland, were significantly correlated with plant-derived compounds. At the same time, there were significant correlations between Proteobacteria and microbial-derived compounds, as well as between Firmicutes and aromatic-derived compounds (relative abundance). Under future climate change, microbial activity will increase as temperature increases, which will promote LF-SOM degradation only if precipitation also increases.","We thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments that helped to improve the manuscript.

Yet, there is hitherto a lack of consensus on the role of litter in governing the soil-atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in forest ecosystems, which can significantly affect the overall climatic cooling impacts of forests as a net carbon sink. In this study, we carried out a meta-analysis of over 250 field observations to determine the response of soil GHG fluxes to in situ litter manipulation in global forests. Our results showed that overall, litter addition enhanced soil CO2 emissions from terrestrial forests by 26%, while litter removal reduced soil CO2 emissions from these forests by 26%. The negative response of soil CO2 emissions to litter removal was stronger in the tropical forests (-33%) than in the subtropical (-27%) and temperate (-21%) forests, and was significantly correlated with mean annual temperature and precipitation. Moreover, litter removal was observed to enhance soil CH4 uptake in tropical (+24%) and temperate (+9%) forests, but not in subtropical forests. Litter removal reduced N2O emissions from forest soils by 20% on average, with this negative effect increasing with mean annual precipitation. The duration of litter removal experiment was negatively correlated with the response of soil CO2 emissions but had no influence on the response of soil CH4 and N2O fluxes. We found that plant litter supply could alter soil GHG fluxes in forests by modulating the microclimate as well as the labile and recalcitrant soil carbon pools. Our findings highlighted the importance of considering the effects of changing plant litter inputs on soil-atmosphere GHG fluxes in terrestrial forests and their spatio-temporal variability in biogeochemical models.","This work was funded by the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Grant No. CUHK14302014, CUHK14305515 and CUHK14122521).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Forests; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Soil,2022-05-16,2022,2022-05-16,2022-09,838,Pt 2,155995,Closed,Article,"Cui, Jinglan; Lam, Shu Kee; Xu, Shan; Lai, Derrick Yuk Fo","Cui, Jinglan (Department of Geography and Resource Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.); Lam, Shu Kee (School of Agriculture and Food, Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia.); Xu, Shan (Department of Geography and Resource Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.); Lai, Derrick Yuk Fo (Department of Geography and Resource Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong; Centre for Environmental Policy and Resource Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, China.

This expansion has led to the conversion of carbon-rich land-use types to oil palm plantations with a range of negative environmental impacts, including loss of carbon from aboveground biomass and soil. Sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) in existing oil palm plantations is an important strategy to limit carbon losses. The aim of this study was to investigate SOC stocks of oil palm plantations under different management systems. Soil samples were collected from three different management systems (best management practices (BMP), current management practices typical of large plantations (CMP) and smallholder management practices (SHMP)) in north Sumatra, Indonesia. Plantations were divided into four management zones that were sampled separately with four replicate profiles in the weeded circle, frond stack, harvesting path and interrow zones. All the soil samples were collected from five (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-50 and 50-70 cm) soil depths. Soil samples were analysed for concentration of SOC, soil texture, soil bulk density and pH. Calculations of SOC stocks in the soils were undertaken according to the fixed-depth and equivalent soil mass approaches. Results showed that SOC stocks of plantations under BMP (68 t ha-1) were 31% and 18% higher than under CMP (57 t ha-1) and SHMP (46 t ha-1) respectively. In the BMP system, soils under the interrow zone that received enriched mulch and frond stack positions stored significantly more SOC than the harvesting path of the BMP system (77, 73 and 57 t ha-1 respectively). BMP also had a 33% higher fresh fruit bunch yield compared to the SHMP system. This study shows that residue incorporation or retention as a part of BMP could be an effective strategy for increasing SOC stocks of oil palm plantations and confirms that these management practices could improve yields from SHMP systems.","This work has been conducted as part of a Ph.D. fellowship project supported by the Agricultural Transformation by Innovation (AgTrain), Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate Programme, funded by the EACEA (Education, Audio-visual and Culture Executive Agency) of the European Commission under agreement no. 2012-002.

The effects of long-term mulching on the soil-microbe-plant system, however, are largely unknown. As mulching years is positively correlated with PMFR concentrations, we used a controlled pot experiment to investigate the effects of mulching years (20a: The concentration of PMFR is about 2 g kg-1, 60a: About 6 g kg-1) on rice growth, rhizosphere bacterial communities, and soil organic carbon (SOC) under different soil pH conditions. Mulching years reduced rice growth; 20a showed more negative effects than 60a on rice tillers number and biomass. PMFR changed the composition, diversity, and metabolic function of the rhizosphere bacterial communities. The content of SOC decreased as mulching residues increased; total organic carbon (TOC), soil organic matter (SOM), Fn (355), and humification index (HIX) declined by 30.24%, 55.97%, 59.74%, and 70.24%, respectively. Furthermore, significant correlations between bacterial communities and SOC were observed in the soil-microbe-plant system. PMFR showed stronger negative effects on rice growth in acidic soil (pH 4.5); however, in basic soil (pH 8.5), there were stronger variations within the bacterial communities and a more significant decline in SOC than acidic soil (pH 4.5). The results of this study are expected to provide theoretical references for understanding of the effects of PMFR on agroecosystems and preventing and controlling plastic pollution.","This study was funded by Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (319MS008), National Nature Science Foundation of China(41571288), Research initiation fund of Hainan University (KYQD(ZR)20032), National Science and Technology Support Program of China (2014BAD14B04) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (41603107, 41867047).

However, the interactions among nZVI, soil organic matter (SOM), and indigenous dechlorinating bacteria are intricate, which may result in unascertained effects on the reductive degradation of OCs and merits specific investigation. Herein, we isolated an indigenous dehalogenation bacterium (Burkholderia ambifaria strain L3) from a paddy soil and further investigated the biodechlorination of pentachlorophenol (PCP) with individual and a combination of SOM and nZVI. In comparison with individual-strain L3 treatment, the cotreatment with nZVI or SOM increased the removal efficiency of PCP from 34.4 to 44.3-54.2% after 15 day cultivation. More importantly, a synergistic effect of SOM and nZVI was observed on the PCP removal by strain L3, and the PCP removal efficiency reached up to 75.3-84.5%. Other than the biodegradation through ortho- and meta-substitution under the individual application of SOM or nZVI, PCP was further biodegraded to 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) through para-substitution by the isolated bacteria with the cotreatment of SOM and nZVI. The main roles of the nZVI-SOM cotreatment in the biodegradation included the SOM-facilitated microbial proliferation, the nZVI-promoted microbial transformation of SOM, and the induced higher electron transport capacity of redox Fe-PCP biocycling. These findings provide a novel insight into the action of nZVI in environmental remediations.","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFA0207003 and 2021YFA1202700), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U21A20613, 21621005, and 42192573), the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LD21B070001), the Ecological Civilization Research Plan of Zhejiang University, and the China Agriculture Research System (CARS-02).",,Environmental Science and Technology,,,"Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Iron; Soil; Soil Pollutants",2022-04-07,2022,2022-04-07,2022-04-19,56,8,4915-4925,Closed,Article,"Liu, Yangzhi; Wang, Yanlong; Wu, Ting; Xu, Jiang; Lin, Daohui","Liu, Yangzhi (Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Organic Pollution Process and Control, Department of Environmental Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China; The Institute of Environment, Resources, Soil and Fertilizers, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, 310021, China); Wang, Yanlong (Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Organic Pollution Process and Control, Department of Environmental Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China); Wu, Ting (Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Organic Pollution Process and Control, Department of Environmental Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China); Xu, Jiang (Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Organic Pollution Process and Control, Department of Environmental Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China); Lin, Daohui (Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Organic Pollution Process and Control, Department of Environmental Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China; Zhejiang Ecological Civilization Academy, Anji, 313300, China)","Lin, Daohui (Zhejiang University; )","Liu, Yangzhi (Zhejiang University; ZheJiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences); Wang, Yanlong (Zhejiang University); Wu, Ting (Zhejiang University); Xu, Jiang (Zhejiang University); Lin, Daohui (Zhejiang University)",8,8,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146952208,41 Environmental Sciences; 4103 Environmental Biotechnology,

Alfalfa production cannot meet demands both in yield and quality. It is necessary to apply fertilizers to achieve high yields and produce high-quality alfalfa in China. However, there is no understanding on the impact of fertilizer application on alfalfa production and the possible optimal application rates across China.
Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis to explore the contribution of fertilizer application to the yield and quality of alfalfa based on a dataset from 86 studies published between 2004 and 2022.
Results and Discussion: The results showed that fertilizer application not only increased alfalfa yield by 19.2% but also improved alfalfa quality by increasing crude protein (CP) by 7.7% and decreasing acid detergent fibre by 2.9% and neutral detergent fibre by 1.8% overall compared to the non-fertilizer control levels. The combined nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) and combined NP fertilizer applications achieved the greatest yield and CP concentration increases of 27.0% and 13.5%, respectively. Considering both yield and quality, the optimal rate of fertilizer application ranged from 30 to 60 kg ha-1 for N, 120 to 150 kg ha-1 for P and less than 120 kg ha-1 for K. Meta-analysis further showed that the effect of fertilizer application on yield was greater in low soil organic matter (SOM) soils than in high SOM soils. In conclusion, fertilizer application is an effective strategy to improve the yield and quality of alfalfa in China, especially that grown in low SOM soils. This study is helpful for optimizing fertilization schedules of alfalfa in China.",,"This study was supported by grant from the Double First-Class Financial Capital in China (Grant no.: NDYB2018-4), the Scientific Research Start-up Fund of the Autonomous Region Human Resources and Social Security Department in 2018 (for HL), Project of Grassland Talent (for HL).",Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2022-11-23,2022,2022-11-23,,13,,1051725,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wan, Weifan; Li, Yuejin; Li, Haigang","Wan, Weifan (Inner Mongolia Key Laboratory of Soil Quality and Nutrient Resources, Key Laboratory of Agricultural Ecological Security and Green Development at Universities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia Agricultural University, Hohhot, China.); Li, Yuejin (Inner Mongolia Key Laboratory of Soil Quality and Nutrient Resources, Key Laboratory of Agricultural Ecological Security and Green Development at Universities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia Agricultural University, Hohhot, China.); Li, Haigang (Inner Mongolia Key Laboratory of Soil Quality and Nutrient Resources, Key Laboratory of Agricultural Ecological Security and Green Development at Universities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia Agricultural University, Hohhot, China.)","Li, Yuejin (Inner Mongolia Agricultural University); Li, Haigang (Inner Mongolia Agricultural University)","Wan, Weifan (Inner Mongolia Agricultural University); Li, Yuejin (Inner Mongolia Agricultural University); Li, Haigang (Inner Mongolia Agricultural University)",4,4,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.1051725/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152982313,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3002 Agriculture, Land and Farm Management; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production",2 Zero Hunger

However, the overall trend and magnitude of changes in SOC, TN and C:N in response to chemical nitrogen fertilizers reduction remain inconclusive. Here, the meta-analysis conducted comparisons at 48 sites covering various cropping system, soil type, and climatic regions of China to investigate the responses of SOC, TN and C:N to chemical nitrogen fertilizers reduction. The results showed that chemical nitrogen fertilizers reduction decreased SOC by 2.76 ± 0.3% and TN by 4.19 ± 0.8%, and increased the C:N by 6.11 ± 0.9% across all the database. Specifically, the reduction of chemical nitrogen without adding organic nitrogen fertilizers would reduce SOC and TN by 3.83% and 11.46% respectively, while they increased SOC and TN by 4.92% and 8.33% respectively with organic fertilizers supplement, suggesting that organic fertilizers could cover the loss of SOC, TN induced by chemical nitrogen fertilizers reduction. Medium magnitude (20–30%) of chemical nitrogen fertilizers reduction enhanced SOC by 6.9%, while high magnitude (≧30%) and total (100%) of chemical nitrogen fertilizers reduction significantly decreased SOC by 3.10% and 7.26% respectively.

Wildfires in coniferous forests are becoming more frequent in many regions, potentially causing large C emissions. Repeated low-intensity prescribed fires can mitigate wildfire severity, but repeated combustion may decrease soil C unless compensatory responses stabilize soil organic matter. Here, we tested how 30 years of decadal prescribed burning affected C and nitrogen (N) in plants, detritus, and soils in coniferous forests in the Sierra Nevada mountains, USA. Tree basal area and litter stocks were resilient to fire, but fire reduced forest floor C by 77% (-36.4 Mg C/ha). In mineral soils, fire reduced C that was free from minerals by 41% (-4.4 Mg C/ha) but not C associated with minerals, and only in depths ≤ 5 cm. Fire also transformed the properties of remaining mineral soil organic matter by increasing the proportion of C in a pyrogenic form (from 3.2% to 7.5%) and associated with minerals (from 46% to 58%), suggesting the remaining soil C is more resistant to decomposition. Laboratory assays illustrated that fire reduced microbial CO2 respiration rates by 55% and the activity of eight extracellular enzymes that degrade cellulosic and aromatic compounds by 40-66%. Lower decomposition was correlated with lower inorganic N (-49%), especially ammonium, suggesting N availability is coupled with decomposition. The relative increase in forms of soil organic matter that are resistant to decay or stabilized onto mineral surfaces, and the associated decline in decomposition suggest that low-intensity fires may promote mineral soil C storage in pools with long mean residence times in coniferous forests.",A.

Although numerous individual studies had been conducted, the global patterns of the changes in SOC concentration following BSCs establishment remain unclear. In this study, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of 184 independent observations at 47 sites to quantify the responses of SOC and other soil variables to BSCs establishment and identify the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that BSCs generally increased SOC by 70.9% compared to the controls (uncrusted soil), and the positive effects of BSCs on SOC in deserts (120.3%) were stronger than those in grasslands (32.7%). Mosses and lichens had a stronger positive effect on SOC than algae crusts (67.5%, 82.8%, and 58.2% respectively). Mixed crusts accumulated more SOC (181.6%) than single (moss, lichen and algae) crusts. The presence of BSCs considerably increased total nitrogen (TN) (+80.7%), total phosphorus (TP) (+20.3%), available N (+62.7%), and available P (+14.3%). Significant relationships were observed among the effect size of SOC and climate and soil N and P in both desert and grassland. The random forest analysis showed that TN could be considered as a determinant of the concentration of SOC, followed by climate (P < 0.01). Our study shows that the capacity of the BSCs to fix and store C could be regulated by soil N and P dynamics, indicating a major finding opening new ways to promote soil recovery and formation. Our findings highlight the remarkable contribution of mixed crusts to soil C pools; this contribution needs to be incorporated into regional and global models to predict the effects of human disturbance on drylands worldwide and for assessing the soil C budget.","We extend our gratitude to all the scientists whose data were considered for our synthesis study.

Here, we explored the overlooked role of soil fauna on SOC storage in forests, hypothesizing that soil faunal activity is particularly drought-sensitive, thereby reducing litter incorporation into the mineral soil and, eventually, long-term SOC storage. In a drought-prone pine forest (Switzerland), we performed a large-scale irrigation experiment for 17 years and assessed its impact on vertical SOC distribution and composition. We also examined litter mass loss of dominant tree species using different mesh-size litterbags and determined soil fauna abundance and community composition. The 17-year-long irrigation resulted in a C loss in the organic layers (-1.0 kg C m-2 ) and a comparable C gain in the mineral soil (+0.8 kg C m-2 ) and thus did not affect total SOC stocks. Irrigation increased the mass loss of Quercus pubescens and Viburnum lantana leaf litter, with greater effect sizes when meso- and macrofauna were included (+215%) than when excluded (+44%). The enhanced faunal-mediated litter mass loss was paralleled by a many-fold increase in the abundance of meso- and macrofauna during irrigation. Moreover, Acari and Collembola community composition shifted, with a higher presence of drought-sensitive species in irrigated soils. In comparison, microbial SOC mineralization was less sensitive to soil moisture. Our results suggest that the vertical redistribution of SOC with irrigation was mainly driven by faunal-mediated litter incorporation, together with increased root C inputs. Our study shows that soil fauna is highly sensitive to natural drought, which leads to a reduced C transfer from organic layers to the mineral soil. In the longer term, this potentially affects SOC storage and, therefore, soil fauna plays a key but so far largely overlooked role in shaping SOC responses to drought.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study is based on the long‐term irrigation experiment Pfynwald, which is part of the Swiss Long‐term Forest Ecosystem Research Program LWF (www.lwf.ch).

This literature review focuses on land quality evaluation (LQE) and its effects on sustainable development through quantitative analysis and value-added information. In contrast to the traditional perspective, a structured review based on bibliometric indicators and social network analysis allows identifying hidden evidence for answering the following research questions: (i) What: What is the application of LQE? (ii) Which: Which sustainable development goals does the application contribute to? (iii) Why and how: What are the main applications and methods of each topic? (iv) Where: Where is the hotspot of the problem? What is the future research orientation of the topic? (v) How and when: How has the topic grown since 2000? Data investigation explores 4029 articles in 2000–2019 from four publishers. With the support of VOSviewer software, six clusters corresponding to six main applications of LQE are classified. Overlapping keywords in several clusters are resolved by the binary term frequency counter for the cluster preference determination. After conducting the data verification and editing process, a structured review is performed again with systematic research questions. This research offers a synthesis of traditional and novel quantitative analysis for literature review, which is comprehensive, accurate, and reliable.",,,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,,,Bibliometrics; Environmental Monitoring; Social Network Analysis; Software; Sustainable Development,2022-07-22,2022,2022-07-22,2022-09,194,9,603,Closed,Article,"Pham, Tam Minh; Dang, Giang Thi Huong; Ju, Bora; Nguyen, Trung Trong","Pham, Tam Minh (VNU Central Institute for Natural Resources and Environmental Studies, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, 19 Le Thanh Tong Str., 100000, Hanoi, Vietnam); Dang, Giang Thi Huong (VNU Central Institute for Natural Resources and Environmental Studies, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, 19 Le Thanh Tong Str., 100000, Hanoi, Vietnam); Ju, Bora (The World Bank Group, Urban Resilience and Land Global Practice Group, Songdo, South Korea); Nguyen, Trung Trong (Faculty of Mathematics, Mechanics, and Informatics, VNU University of Science, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, 334 Nguyen Trai Str., 100000, Hanoi, Vietnam)","Pham, Tam Minh (VNU Central Institute for Natural Resources and Environmental Studies)","Pham, Tam Minh (VNU Central Institute for Natural Resources and Environmental Studies); Dang, Giang Thi Huong (VNU Central Institute for Natural Resources and Environmental Studies); Ju, Bora (); Nguyen, Trung Trong (VNU University of Science)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149653218,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

This accumulation of soil organic matter is a vital component of elevation gain in coastal wetlands responding to sea-level rise. Anthropogenic activities that alter coastal wetland function through disruption of tidal exchange and wetland water levels are ubiquitous. This study assesses soil vertical accretion and organic carbon accretion across five coastal wetlands that experienced over a century of impounded hydrology, followed by restoration of tidal exchange 5 to 14 years prior to sampling. Nearby marshes that never experienced tidal impoundment served as controls with natural hydrology to assess the impact of impoundment and restoration. Dated soil cores indicate that elevation gain and carbon storage were suppressed 30-70 % during impoundment, accounting for the majority of elevation deficit between impacted and natural sites. Only one site had substantial subsidence, likely due to oxidation of soil organic matter. Vertical and carbon accretion gains were achieved at all restored sites, with carbon burial increasing from 96 ± 33 to 197 ± 64 g C m-2 y-1. The site with subsidence was able to accrete at double the rate (13 ± 5.6 mm y-1) of the natural complement, due predominantly to organic matter accumulation rather than mineral deposition, indicating these ecosystems are capable of large dynamic responses to restoration when conditions are optimized for vegetation growth. Hydrologic restoration enhanced elevation resilience and climate benefits of these coastal wetlands.","This project was supported by the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Hazards and Resources Program and the USGS Land Change Science Program&#x27;s LandCarbon program, NOAA National Estuarine Research Reserve Science Collaborative NA14NOS4190145, and MIT Sea Grant 2015-R/RC-141.

Here, we provide a concise review of silicon's roles in soil chemistry and physics and in plant physiology and ecology, focusing on the processes that form these feedback mechanisms. Through this review and analysis, we demonstrate how this feedback network drives ecosystem processes and affects ecosystem functioning. Consequently, we show that Si uptake and accumulation by plants is involved in several ecosystem services like soil appropriation, biomass supply, and carbon sequestration. Considering the demand for food of an increasing global population and the challenges of climate change, a detailed understanding of the underlying processes of these ecosystem services is of prime importance. Silicon and its role in ecosystem functioning and services thus should be the main focus of future research.","We thank J.

However, the sustained effects of additives on the GHGs emissions following incorporation of composts to soil were scarcely explored. This study evaluated the effects of bentonite added at the beginning of pig manure composting on the GHGs emissions during two successive processes, i.e., composting and soil incubation amended with composting products. Addition of bentonite did not hinder the composting process and alter the total CO2 emission. On the other hand, reduction by about 17% and 29% for CH4 and N2O emission, respectively, was achieved in the presence of bentonite during composting. Incorporation of the final composting products to soil enhanced significantly the soil C and N of various forms, and gas emissions of CO2 and N2O. However, no significant differences were observed between bentonite-manure co-compost and manure-only compost application except for the N2O emission. Compared to the manure-only compost, compost amended with bentonite reduced N2O loss by around 6.8%, but not statistically significant. This study confirmed that addition of bentonite at the composting stage can mitigate the GHGs emission considering both composting and compost application stages, with all reductions occurring at the composting stage.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Despite the ongoing threat of nitrogen (N) pollution especially in the fast-developing regions, it remains unclear how increasing N deposition affects soil pH across global terrestrial ecosystems. By conducting a global meta-analysis with paired observations of soil pH under N addition and control from 634 studies spanning major types of terrestrial ecosystems, we show that soil acidification increases rapidly with N addition amount and is most severe in neutral-pH soils. Grassland soil pH decreases most strongly under high N addition while wetlands are the least acidified. By extrapolating these relationships to global mapping, we reveal that atmospheric N deposition leads to a global average soil pH decline of -0.16 in the past 40 years and regions encompassing Eastern United States, Southern Brazil, Europe, and South and East Asia are the hotspots of soil acidification under N deposition. Our results highlight that anthropogenically amplified atmospheric N deposition has profoundly altered global soil pH and chemistry. They suggest that atmospheric N deposition is a major threat to global terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem functions.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the authors whose work is included in this meta‐analysis.

Current practices to prevent damage to downstream urban areas include allowing the flooding of upstream agricultural land. Earthworms are ecosystem engineers, but their abundances in arable land are already reduced due to pressure from farming practices. If flooding increases on agricultural land, it is important to understand how earthworms will respond to the dual stresses of flooding and agricultural land use. The earthworm populations under three land uses (pasture, field margin, and crops), across two UK fields, were sampled seasonally over an 18-month period in areas of the fields which flood frequently and areas which flood only rarely. Earthworm abundance in the crop and pasture soils and total earthworm biomass in the crop soils was significantly lower in the frequently flooded areas than in the rarely flooded areas. The relative percentage difference in the populations between the rarely and frequently flooded areas was greater in the crop soils (-59.18% abundance, -63.49% biomass) than the pasture soils (-13.39% abundance, -9.66% biomass). In the margin soils, earthworm abundance was significantly greater in the frequently flooded areas (+140.56%), likely due to higher soil organic matter content and lower bulk density resulting in soil conditions more amenable to earthworms. The findings of this study show that earthworm populations already stressed by the activities associated with arable land use are more susceptible to flooding than populations in pasture fields, suggesting that arable earthworm populations are likely to be increasingly at risk with increased flooding.","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the White Rose University Consortium through the BIOchemical-physical-biological function of Sludge in Agriculture Soils (BioSAS, 2016-2020) PhD studentship network and thank the other network members (James Chong, Kirsty Elliot, Nick Humphries, Jonathan Leake, Doug Stewart and Steve Thornton) for helpful discussions.

It is possible to estimate BD by applying pedotransfer function (PTF). We applied different estimation methods with the aim to define a suitable PTF for BD of arable land for the Mediterranean Basin, which has peculiar climate features that may influence the soil carbon sequestration. To improve the existing BD estimation methods, we used a set of public climatic and topographic data along with the soil texture and organic carbon data. The present work consisted of the following steps: i) development of three PTFs models separately for top (0-0.4 m) and subsoil (0.4-1.2 m), ii) a 10-fold cross-validation, iii) model transferability using an external dataset derived from published data. The development of the new PTFs was based on the training dataset consisting of World Soil Information Service (WoSIS) soil profile data, climatic data from WorldClim at 1 km spatial resolution and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model at 30 m spatial resolution. The three PTFs models were developed using: Multiple Linear Regression stepwise (MLR-S), Multiple Linear Regression backward stepwise (MLR-BS), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The predictions of the newly developed PTFs were compared with the BD calculated using the PTF proposed by Manrique and Jones (MJ) and the modelled BD derived from the global SoilGrids dataset. For the topsoil training dataset (N = 129), MLR-S, MLR-BS and ANN had a R2 0.35, 0.58 and 0.86, respectively. For the model transferability, the three PTFs applied to the external topsoil dataset (N = 59), achieved R2 values of 0.06, 0.03 and 0.41. For the subsoil training dataset (N = 180), MLR-S, MLR-BS and ANN the R2 values were 0.36, 0.46 and 0.83, respectively. When applied to the external subsoil dataset (N = 29), the R2 values were 0.05, 0.06 and 0.41. The cross-validation for both top and subsoil dataset, resulted in an intermediate performance compared to calibration and validation with the external dataset. The new ANN PTF outperformed MLR-S, MLR-BS, MJ and SoilGrids approaches for estimating BD. Further improvements may be achieved by additionally considering the time of sampling, agricultural soil management and cultivation practices in predictive models.","All authors acknowledge the funding for the Lake Como Advanced School provided by the grant for the SDAE Summer School 2019 from the Italian Society of Agronomy, University of Milan and University of Pavia.

A study was carried out in a semi-arid region of central India to determine the short-term (6-year) impact of nine range grasses on soil physio-chemical and biological properties, carbon stock, and forage security. The experiment was carried out in a randomized block design with three replications. Results show that the majority of the grass roots were distributed in the upper soil layer (0-10 cm, 63.5-76.5 %), and then in the middle (10-20 cm, 21.3-25 %) and lower (20-30 cm, 2.2-11.5 %) layers. Perennial tussock grass (Heteropogon contortus (L.) P. Beauv. ex Roem. & Schult) had a higher root volume (2219 mm3), followed by Guinea grass [Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B.K. Simon & S.W.L. Jacobs] (1860 mm3). A lower soil bulk density (BD, 1.11-1.23 g cm-3), higher gravimetric water content (GMW, 14.0-17.8 %), and soil organic carbon (0.38-0.73 %) were recorded for grass-cultivated plots compared to the barren land (1.38 g cm-3, 13.0 %, and 0.28 %, respectively). The perennial tussock grass and Guinea grass resulted in the highest soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC, 70.1 mg kg-1 soil) and enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, 17.09 μg TPF g-1 day-1 and fluorescein diacetate activity 4.94 μg fluorescein g-1 h-1). The considerable improvement in soil properties with minimal inputs resulted in a higher sustainable yield index and carbon sustainability index in plots planted with Guinea grass (0.9 and 89.29) and perennial tussock grass (0.89 and 71.61). Therefore, the cultivation of either Guinea grass or perennial tussock grass as an intercrop or sole crop in the semi-arid environment can be an ecologically sound strategy to improve soil health, C sequestration, and fodder supply.","This research was funded by ICAR-Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute, Jhansi, India.

In viticulture, soil management often includes tillage, which poses a multifaceted disturbance to the soil environment and has direct and indirect effects on soil microbial diversity and soil functioning. However, the challenge of disentangling the effects of different soil management practices on soil microbial diversity and functioning has rarely been addressed. In this study, we investigated the effects of soil management on soil bacterial and fungal diversity as well as soil functions (soil respiration and decomposition) using a balanced experimental design with four soil management types in nine vineyards in Germany. Application of structural equation modelling enabled us to investigate the causal relationships of soil disturbance, vegetation cover, and plant richness on soil properties, microbial diversity, and soil functions. We could show that soil disturbance by tillage increased bacterial diversity but decreased fungal diversity. We identified a positive effect of plant diversity on bacterial diversity. Soil respiration showed a positive response to soil disturbance, while decomposition was negatively affected in highly disturbed soils via mediated effects of vegetation removal. Our results contribute to the understanding of direct and indirect effects of vineyard soil management on soil life and aids designing targeted recommendations for agricultural soil management.","We wish to thank all participating farmers for providing their vineyards and giving additional information.

The effects of grazing on alpine grasslands highly depends on grazing intensity. Up to now, we still lack comprehensive understanding of the general responses of alpine grasslands to different grazing intensities over broad geographic scales across the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore the responses of plant characteristics and soil properties to grazing intensity in alpine grasslands of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau based on 52 peer-reviewed literatures. The results showed that grazing did not change the belowground biomass, while significantly increased the ratio of root to shoot (P< 0.05). Light grazing exhibited no significant effects on the plant richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, soil water content, soil bulk density, nutrients, microbial biomass carbon, and microbial biomass nitrogen (P > 0.05). Moderate grazing significantly increased the plant richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity, while significantly decreased the soil organic carbon and total nitrogen (P< 0.05). Heavy grazing significantly decreased the plant richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, water content, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon, and microbial biomass nitrogen, and significantly increased the soil bulk density (P< 0.05). These findings suggest that overgrazing is closely associated with grassland degradation, and moderate grazing is a sustainable practice to provide animal production and simultaneously maintain ecological functions for alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.",,"This research was funded by the Development of Agricultural iot Data Acquisition Terminal (6602422240), the Agricultural Research System of China (CARS-34), the First Class Grassland Science Discipline Programme in Shandong Province of China.",Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2023-01-17,2023,2023-01-17,,13,,1083709,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhang, Zhenchao; Zhao, Yiran; Lin, Hao; Li, Yanpeng; Fu, Jinmin; Wang, Yingxin; Sun, Juan; Zhao, Yanhua","Zhang, Zhenchao (Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration on Grassland Resources and Ecology in the Yellow River Delta, College of Grassland Science, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao, Shandong, China); Zhao, Yiran (Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration on Grassland Resources and Ecology in the Yellow River Delta, College of Grassland Science, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao, Shandong, China); Lin, Hao (Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration on Grassland Resources and Ecology in the Yellow River Delta, College of Grassland Science, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao, Shandong, China); Li, Yanpeng (School of Mapping and Geographic Information, Jiangxi College of Applied Technology, Ganzhou, China); Fu, Jinmin (Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration on Grassland Resources and Ecology in the Yellow River Delta, College of Grassland Science, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao, Shandong, China); Wang, Yingxin (Grassland Research Center of National Forestry and Grassland Administration, Research Institute of Ecological Conservation and Restoration, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Beijing, China); Sun, Juan (Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration on Grassland Resources and Ecology in the Yellow River Delta, College of Grassland Science, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao, Shandong, China); Zhao, Yanhua (Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration on Grassland Resources and Ecology in the Yellow River Delta, College of Grassland Science, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao, Shandong, China)","Fu, Jinmin (Qingdao Agricultural University); Zhao, Yanhua (Qingdao Agricultural University)","Zhang, Zhenchao (Qingdao Agricultural University); Zhao, Yiran (Qingdao Agricultural University); Lin, Hao (Qingdao Agricultural University); Li, Yanpeng (Jiangxi College of Applied Technology); Fu, Jinmin (Qingdao Agricultural University); Wang, Yingxin (Chinese Academy of Forestry); Sun, Juan (Qingdao Agricultural University); Zhao, Yanhua (Qingdao Agricultural University)",1,1,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.1083709/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154596321,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3007 Forestry Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology",14 Life Below Water

Management practices, like diversifying and perennializing agroecosystems, may affect the decomposer organisms that regulate how new residue is converted to persistent soil organic matter. Here we tested whether 12 years of diversifying/perennializing plants in agroecosystems through extended rotations or grassland restoration would decrease losses of new plant residue inputs and, thus, increase retention of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil. We tracked dual-labeled (13 C and 15 N), isotopically enriched wheat (Triticum aestivum) residue in situ for 2 years as it decomposed in three agroecosystems: maize-soybean (CS) rotation, maize-soybean-wheat plus red clover and cereal rye cover crops (CSW2), and spring fallow management with regeneration of natural grassland species (seven to 10 species; SF). We measured losses of wheat residue (Cwheat and Nwheat ) in leached soil solution and greenhouse gas fluxes, as well as how much was recovered in microbial biomass and bulk soil at 5-cm increments down to 20 cm. CSW2 and SF both had unique, significant effects on residue decomposition and retention dynamics that were clear only when using nuanced metrics that able to tease apart subtle differences. For example, SF retained a greater portion of Cwheat in 0-5 cm surface soils (155%, p = 0.035) and narrowed the Cwheat to Nwheat ratio (p < 0.030) compared to CS. CSW2 increased an index of carbon-retention efficiency, Cwheat retained in the mesocosm divided by total measured, from 0.18 to 0.27 (49%, p = 0.001), compared to CS. Overall, we found that diversifying and extending the duration of living plants in agroecosystems can lead to greater retention of new residue inputs in subtle ways that require further investigation to fully understand.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Support for this research came from USDA Grant 2015‐42247‐519119 and the NSF Long‐Term Ecological Research Program (NSF Division of Environmental Biology Grant 1027253) at the Kellogg Biological Station and by Michigan State University AgBioResearch.

Here, we evaluated the phytotoxic variation in compost produced by facultative heap composting of four types of animal manure (chicken manure, pig manure, sheep manure, and cattle manure) using different plant seeds (cucumber, radish, Chinese cabbage, and oilseed rape) to determine germination index (GI). The key factors that affected GI values were identified, including the dynamics of the phytotoxicity and microbial community during heap composting. Sensitivity to toxicity differed depending on the type of plant seed used. Phytotoxicity during facultative heap composting, evaluated by the GI, was in the order: chicken manure (0-6.6 %) < pig manure (14.4-90.5 %) < sheep manure (46.0-93.0 %) < cattle manure (50.2-105.8 %). Network analysis showed that the volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration was positively correlated with Firmicutes abundance, and NH4+-N was correlated with Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. More bacteria were stimulated to participate in conversions of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved nitrogen, VFA, and ammonia-nitrogen (NH4+-N) in sheep manure heap composting than that in other manure. The GI was most affected by VFA in chicken manure and cattle manure heap composting, while NH4+-N was the main factor affecting the GI in pig manure and sheep manure compost. The dissolved carbon and nitrogen content and composition, as well as the core and proprietary microbial communities, were the primary factors that affected the succession of phytotoxic substances in facultative heap composting, which in turn affected GI values. In this study, the key pathways of livestock manure composting that affected GI and phytotoxicity were found and evaluated, which provided new insights and theoretical support for the safe use of organic fertilizer.","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42207380), the Major Science and Technology plan of Hainan Province in China (ZDKJ2021009), and the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province in China (ZR2021QE019).",,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,,,"Swine; Cattle; Sheep; Animals; Composting; Manure; Livestock; Farms; Germination; Seeds; Toxins, Biological; Alkaloids; Nitrogen; Chickens",2022-10-31,2022,2022-10-31,2022-12,247,,114251,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kong, Yilin; Wang, Guoying; Chen, Wenjie; Yang, Yan; Ma, Ruonan; Li, Danyang; Shen, Yujun; Li, Guoxue; Yuan, Jing","Kong, Yilin (Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation, College of Resources and Environmental Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.); Wang, Guoying (Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation, College of Resources and Environmental Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.); Chen, Wenjie (Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation, College of Resources and Environmental Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China; Organic Recycling Institute (Suzhou) of China Agricultural University, Wuzhong District, Suzhou 215128, China.); Yang, Yan (Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation, College of Resources and Environmental Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.); Ma, Ruonan (Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation, College of Resources and Environmental Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.); Li, Danyang (Institute of Energy and Environmental Protection, Academy of Agricultural Planning & Engineering, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Beijing 100125, China.); Shen, Yujun (Institute of Energy and Environmental Protection, Academy of Agricultural Planning & Engineering, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Beijing 100125, China.); Li, Guoxue (Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation, College of Resources and Environmental Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China; Organic Recycling Institute (Suzhou) of China Agricultural University, Wuzhong District, Suzhou 215128, China.); Yuan, Jing (Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation, College of Resources and Environmental Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China; Organic Recycling Institute (Suzhou) of China Agricultural University, Wuzhong District, Suzhou 215128, China.

However, the regulatory mechanisms of N2O production by ammonia oxidizers at the microbial community level under POS regimes remain unclear. This study explored soil ammonia oxidation and related N2O production, further building an understanding of the correlations between ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) activity and community structure in tropical arable soils under four-year field management regimes (CK, without fertilizer N; N, with only inorganic N; M1N1, with 1/2 organic N + 1/2 inorganic N; M1N2, with 1/3 organic N + 2/3 inorganic N). AOA contributed more to potential ammonia oxidation (PAO) than AOB across all treatments. In comparison with CK, N treatment had no obvious effects on PAO and lowered related N2O emissions by decreasing soil pH and downregulating the abundance of AOA- and AOB-amoA. POS regimes significantly enhanced PAO and N2O emissions relative to N treatment by promoting the abundances and contributions of AOA and AOB. The stimulated AOA-dominated N2O production under M1N1 was correlated with promoted development of Nitrososphaera. By contrast, the increased AOB-dominated N2O production under M1N2 was linked to the enhanced development of Nitrosospira multiformis.

Leonardite, which is characterized by oxygen-rich functional groups and low pH, has been found to decrease losses of slurry N. However, leonardite, as a byproduct of open-cast lignite mining, is not a renewable resource. The objective of this study was to modify biochar by chemical surface oxidation in order to find a sustainable but similarly effective substitute for leonardite. Biochar was produced from spruce sawdust in a pyrolysis oven at a maximum temperature of 610 °C. Then the biochar was oxidized using the Fenton reaction, with a ratio of Fe2+ /H2 O2 of 1:1,000, as a source of highly reactive HO· radicals to introduce oxygen-rich functional groups to the biochar surface. The ammonium (NH4 + ) adsorption capacity of biochar, oxidized biochar, and leonardite was tested in ammonium sulfate [(NH4 )2 SO4 ] solution, pH-adjusted (NH4 )2 SO4 solution, and cattle slurry. The results showed that biochar had the highest total NH4 + adsorption of 1.4 mg N g-1 in (NH4 )2 SO4 solution, whereas oxidized biochar had the highest reversible NH4 + adsorption of 0.8 mg N g-1 . In the pH-adjusted ammonium solution, all materials reduced NH3 emissions by ≥90%, and oxidized biochar reduced NH3 emissions by 99.99%. In contrast, leonardite reduced NH3 emissions the most in cattle slurry, and oxidation of biochar increased the reduction in NH3 emissions from 22 to 67% compared with non-oxidized biochar. In conclusion, biochar oxidized by means of the Fenton reaction greatly decreased NH3 emissions by increased adsorption of NH4 + in cattle slurry compared with non-oxidized biochar, indicating the great potential of oxidized biochar for reducing N losses during slurry application.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was conducted in as part of the INPLAMINT project of the BonaRes initiative, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, FKZ 031B0508A), and was supported by the Chinese Scholarship Council (Scholarship No. 201706340157).

In this study, we synthesized 182 studies (222 sites) worldwide to evaluate the impacts of inhibitors (urease inhibitors [UI], nitrification inhibitors [NI] and combined inhibitors) on crop yields and gaseous N loss (ammonia [NH3 ] and nitrous oxide [N2 O] emissions) and explored their responses to different management and environmental factors including inhibitor application timing, fertilization regime, cropping system, water management, soil properties and climatic conditions using subgroup meta-analysis, meta-regression and multivariate analyses. The UI were most effective in enhancing crop yields (by 5%) and reducing NH3 volatilization (by 51%), whereas NI were most effective at reducing N2 O emissions (by 49%). The application of UI mitigates NH3 loss and increases crop yields especially in high NH3 -N loss scenarios, whereas NI application would minimize the net N2 O emissions and the resultant environmental impacts especially in low NH3 -N loss scenarios. Alternatively, the combined application of UI and NI enables producers to balance crop production and environmental conservation goals without pollution tradeoffs. The inhibitor efficacy for decreasing gaseous N loss was dependent upon soil and climatic conditions and management practices. Notably, both meta-regression and multivariate analyses suggest that inhibitors provide a greater opportunity for reducing fertilizer N inputs in high-N-surplus systems and presumably favor crop yield enhancement under soil N deficiency situations. The pursuit of an improved understanding of the interactions between plant-soil-climate-management systems and different types of inhibitors should continue to optimize the effectiveness of inhibitors for reducing environmental losses while increasing productivity.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Funding for this meta‐analysis study was received from project “China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA”, and financial support from the Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences (KJCX20220416, YZS202103, QNJJ201907, QNJJ202133).

5669,pub.1124048891,10.1111/gcb.14993,31930624,,Changes in soil greenhouse gas fluxes by land use change from primary forest,"Primary forest conversion is a worldwide serious problem associated with human disturbance and climate change. Land use change from primary forest to plantation, grassland or agricultural land may lead to profound alteration in the emission of soil greenhouse gases (GHG). Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis concerning the effects of primary forest conversion on soil GHG emissions and explored the potential mechanisms from 101 studies. Our results showed that conversion of primary forest significantly decreased soil CO2 efflux and increased soil CH4 efflux, but had no effect on soil N2 O efflux. However, the effect of primary forest conversion on soil GHG emissions was not consistent across different types of land use change. For example, soil CO2 efflux did not respond to the conversion from primary forest to grassland. Soil N2 O efflux showed a prominent increase within the initial stage after conversion of primary forest and then decreased over time while the responses of soil CO2 and CH4 effluxes were consistently negative or positive across different elapsed time intervals. Moreover, either within or across all types of primary forest conversion, the response of soil CO2 efflux was mainly moderated by changes in soil microbial biomass carbon and root biomass while the responses of soil N2 O and CH4 effluxes were related to the changes in soil nitrate and soil aeration-related factors (soil water content and bulk density), respectively. Collectively, our findings highlight the significant effects of primary forest conversion on soil GHG emissions, enhance our knowledge on the potential mechanisms driving these effects and improve future models of soil GHG emissions after land use change from primary forest.","We are grateful to all scientists whose valuable studies are used in this meta‐analysis.

Here we apply an innovative approach combining space-for-time substitution with meta-analysis to SOC measurements in 113,013 soil profiles across the globe to estimate the effect of future climate warming on steady-state SOC stocks. We find that SOC stock will reduce by 6.0 ± 1.6% (mean±95% confidence interval), 4.8 ± 2.3% and 1.3 ± 4.0% at 0–0.3, 0.3–1 and 1–2 m soil depths, respectively, under 1 °C air warming, with additional 4.2%, 2.2% and 1.4% losses per every additional 1 °C warming, respectively. The largest proportional SOC losses occur in boreal forests. Existing SOC level is the predominant determinant of the spatial variability of SOC changes with higher percentage losses in SOC-rich soils. Our work demonstrates that warming induces more proportional SOC losses in topsoil than in subsoil, particularly from high-latitudinal SOC-rich systems.","We thank Niels H.

How soil organic carbon (SOC) forms and persists remains uncertain1,3, which makes it challenging to understand how it will respond to climatic change3,4. It has been suggested that soil microorganisms play an important role in SOC formation, preservation and loss5–7. Although microorganisms affect the accumulation and loss of soil organic matter through many pathways4,6,8–11, microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) is an integrative metric that can capture the balance of these processes12,13. Although CUE has the potential to act as a predictor of variation in SOC storage, the role of CUE in SOC persistence remains unresolved7,14,15. Here we examine the relationship between CUE and the preservation of SOC, and interactions with climate, vegetation and edaphic properties, using a combination of global-scale datasets, a microbial-process explicit model, data assimilation, deep learning and meta-analysis. We find that CUE is at least four times as important as other evaluated factors, such as carbon input, decomposition or vertical transport, in determining SOC storage and its spatial variation across the globe. In addition, CUE shows a positive correlation with SOC content. Our findings point to microbial CUE as a major determinant of global SOC storage. Understanding the microbial processes underlying CUE and their environmental dependence may help the prediction of SOC feedback to a changing climate.","We thank H. Yang, M. Schrumpf, T. Wutzler, R.

Yet, our understanding of global soil N cycle patterns and drivers and their response to N deposition in these biomes remains elusive. By a meta-analysis of 2426-single and 161-paired observations from 89 published 15  N pool dilution and tracing studies, we found that gross N mineralization (GNM), immobilization of ammonium (   I NH 4     ) and nitrate (   I NO 3     ), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) were significantly higher in tropical forests than in subtropical forests. Soil N cycle was conservative in tropical forests with ratios of gross nitrification (GN) to   I NH 4     (GN/   I NH 4     ) and of soil nitrate to ammonium (NO3 - /NH4 + ) less than one, but was leaky in subtropical forests with GN/   I NH 4     and NO3 - /NH4 + higher than one. Soil NH4 + dynamics were mainly controlled by soil substrate (e.g., total N), but climatic factors (e.g., precipitation and/or temperature) were more important in controlling soil NO3 - dynamics. Soil texture played a role, as GNM and   I NH 4     were positively correlated with silt and clay contents, while   I NO 3     and DNRA were positively correlated with sand and clay contents, respectively. The soil N cycle was more sensitive to N deposition in tropical forests than in subtropical forests. Nitrogen deposition leads to a leaky N cycle in tropical forests, as evidenced by the increase in GN/   I NH 4     , NO3 - /NH4 + , and nitrous oxide emissions and the decrease in   I NO 3     and DNRA, mainly due to the decrease in soil microbial biomass and pH. Dominant tree species can also influence soil N cycle pattern, which has changed from conservative in deciduous forests to leaky in coniferous forests. We provide global evidence that tropical, but not subtropical, forests are characterized by soil N dynamics sustaining N availability and that N deposition inhibits soil N retention and stimulates N losses in these biomes.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors declare no competing financial interests.,Financial support for this work was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42067008) and the High‐Level Talent Project of the Natural Science Foundation of Hainan province (320RC493).,Global Change Biology,,,Nitrogen; Nitrates; Soil; Clay; Forests; Nitrogen Cycle; Ammonium Compounds,2023-01-30,2023,2023-01-30,2023-04,29,7,1905-1921,Closed,Article,"Elrys, Ahmed S.; Zhu, QiLin; Jiang, Chunlan; Liu, Juan; Sobhy, Hamida H.

In this paper, the characteristics and removal of microplastics in 38 WWTPs in 11 countries worldwide were reviewed. The abundance of microplastics in the influent, effluent, and sludge was compared. Then, based on existing data, the removal efficiency of microplastics in critical treatment technologies were compared by quantitative analysis. Particularly, detailed mechanisms of critical treatment technologies including primary settling treatment with flocculation, bioreactor system, advanced oxidation and membrane filtration were discussed. Thereafter, the abundance load and ecological hazard of the microplastics discharged from WWTPs into the aquatic and soil environments were summarized. The abundance of microplastics in the influent ranged from 0.28 particles L-1 to 3.14 × 104 particles L-1, while that in the effluent ranged from 0.01 particles L-1 to 2.97 × 102 particles L-1. The microplastic abundance in the sludge within the range of 4.40 × 103-2.40 × 105 particles kg-1. In addition, there are still 5.00 × 105-1.39 × 1010 microplastic particles discharged into the aquatic environment each day Moreover, among the critical treatment technologies, the quantitative analysis revealed that filter-based treatment technologies exhibited the best microplastics removal efficiency. Fibers and microplastics with large particle sizes (0.5-5 mm) were easily separated by primary settling. Polyethene and small-particle size microplastics (<0.5 mm) were easily trapped by bacteria in the activated sludge of bioreactor system. The negative impact of microplastics from wastewater treatment plant was worthy of attention. Moreover, unknown transformation products of microplastics and their corresponding toxicity need in-depth research.","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41977142, 41977308), Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (No. 2018ZX07111003), Key Technologies Research and Development Program (No. 2019YFC1806104) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. JD2006)",,Environment International,,,"Environmental Monitoring; Microplastics; Plastics; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",2020-11-20,2020,2020-11-20,2021-01,146,,106277,All OA; Gold,Article,"Liu, Weiyi; Zhang, Jinlan; Liu, Hang; Guo, Xiaonan; Zhang, Xiyue; Yao, Xiaolong; Cao, Zhiguo; Zhang, Tingting","Liu, Weiyi (Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Research Centre for Resource and Environment, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China.); Zhang, Jinlan (Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Research Centre for Resource and Environment, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China.); Liu, Hang (Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Research Centre for Resource and Environment, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China.); Guo, Xiaonan (Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Research Centre for Resource and Environment, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China.); Zhang, Xiyue (Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Research Centre for Resource and Environment, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China.); Yao, Xiaolong (Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, People's Republic of China.); Cao, Zhiguo (School of Environment, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, People's Republic of China.); Zhang, Tingting (Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Research Centre for Resource and Environment, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China.

Recent policies such as California's short-lived climate pollutant reduction law (SB 1383) and the Global Methane Pledge call for cuts to livestock CH4 by 2030. However, investments in CH4 reduction strategies are primarily aimed at liquid dairy manure, whereas stockpiled solids remain a large source of CH4. Here, we measure the CH4 and net greenhouse gas reduction potential of dairy manure biochar-composting, a novel manure management strategy, through a composting experiment and life-cycle analysis. We found that biochar-composting reduces CH4 by 79%, compared to composting without biochar. In addition to reducing CH4 during composting, we show that the added climate benefit from biochar production and application contributes to a substantially reduced life-cycle global warming potential for biochar-composting: -535 kg CO2e Mg-1 manure compared to -194 kg CO2e Mg-1 for composting and 102 kg CO2e Mg-1 for stockpiling. If biochar-composting replaces manure stockpiling and complements anaerobic digestion, California could meet SB 1383 with 132 less digesters. When scaled up globally, biochar-composting could mitigate 1.59 Tg CH4 yr-1 while doubling the climate change mitigation potential from dairy manure management.","The authors thank Omar Ramirez and the Aligned Digesters team, Philip Verwey Dairy, and Melisa Quintana for their support and assistance.

5664,pub.1136206027,10.1111/gcb.15587,33683768,,Soil priming effect and its responses to nutrient addition along a tropical forest elevation gradient,"Priming plays important roles in terrestrial carbon cycling, but the patterns and drivers of priming and its responses to nutrient addition in tropical forests remain unclear. By collecting soils along a tropical forest elevation gradient, we conducted an incubation experiment with 13 C-labeled glucose and nutrient (N and/or P) additions. Results showed that priming effects increased soil organic matter decomposition by 44 ± 12% across elevations, and priming intensity decreased significantly with elevation. Among soil and microbial properties, soil organic carbon (SOC) content and pH were two key factors negatively and positively regulating priming, respectively. Across elevations, the additions of N, P, or both of them (NP) did not significantly change priming. However, the variations in the effects of nutrient (N and/or P) addition on priming significantly correlated with initial soil nutrient (N or P) availability. The intensity for the effects of N addition on priming decreased significantly with initial soil N availability, and that for the effects of P and NP addition on priming decreased with initial soil P availability. Based on these relationships, we proposed a conceptual framework linking stoichiometric decomposition and nutrient mining hypotheses, in which the former dominates in low-nutrient availability soils and the latter dominates in high-nutrient availability soils. This conceptual framework can help to explain the contrasting effects of nutrient addition on priming. Collectively, our findings highlight the roles of SOC content and soil pH in regulating priming intensity, and the role of initial soil nutrient availability in regulating the effects of nutrient addition on priming.","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 31988102 and 31670525).

In Europe, it is estimated that over 95 Mt of textile waste are generated along the entire supply chain, with still high percentages of textiles addressed to landfill or incineration. The present research, through a systematic literature review on textiles production and consumption, investigates their environmental concerns assessed through the application of the life cycle assessment. Considering the importance of identifying the products' life cycle hotspots on which actions are needed to reduce the overall impact, the manuscript focuses on the environmental performance related to the cradle-to-grave phases of textile products differentiated by type, composition, and intended use. It results that the production and use phases are those responsible for the greatest share of negative impacts, while the end-of-life generally has a small contribution. Distribution and consumption phases are less investigated, and considering the emerging consumption patterns (e.g., sharing and renting platforms), it seems essential to collect data. Circular practices can bring benefits under the environmental perspective, but in-depth studies are still required to estimate the shift of impacts from one phase of the life cycle to another. Overall, there is a paucity of studies comparing the use of different fibers, ownership models, manufacturing and disposal processes for the same functional unit, or data that would be necessary for low-impact design. The topic is still under-researched among academics and practitioners of the textile industry.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Understanding the changes in forest nitrogen (N) deposition rates has important implications for C sequestration. We explored the effects of N enrichment on soil carbon sequestration in nitrogen-limited and nitrogen-rich Chinese forests and their controlling factors. Our findings reveal that N inputs enhanced net soil C sequestration by 5.52-18.46 kg C kg-1 N, with greater impacts in temperate forests (8.37-13.68 kg C kg-1 N), the use of NH4NO3 fertilizer (7.78 kg Ckg-1 N) at low N levels (<30 kg Ckg-1 N; 9.14 kg Ckg-1 N), and in a short period (<3 years; 12.95 kg C kg-1 N). The nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) varied between 0.24 and 13.3 (kg C kg-1 N) depending on the forest type and was significantly controlled by rainfall, fertilizer, and carbon-nitrogen ratio rates. Besides, N enrichment increased SOC concentration by an average of 7% and 2% for tropical and subtropical forests, respectively. Although soil carbon sequestration was higher in the topsoil compared to the subsoil, the relative influence indicated that nitrogen availability strongly impacts the SOC, followed by dissolved organic carbon concentration and mean annual precipitation.

In this study, an environmental assessment of systems where biochar produced from wood waste with energy recovery is used for remediation of soils contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and metal(loid)s was performed. Two soil remediation options with biochar (on- and off-site) are considered and compared to landfilling. The assessment combined material and energy flow analysis (MEFA), life cycle assessment (LCA), and substance flow analysis (SFA). The MEFA indicated that on-site remediation can save fuel and backfill material compared to off-site remediation and landfilling. However, the net energy production by pyrolysis of wood waste for biochar production is 38% lower than incineration. The LCA showed that both on-site and off-site remediation with biochar performed better than landfilling in 10 of the 12 environmental impact categories, with on-site remediation performing best. Remediation with biochar provided substantial reductions in climate change impact in the studied context, owing to biochar carbon sequestration being up to 4.5 times larger than direct greenhouse gas emissions from the systems. The two biochar systems showed increased impacts only in ionizing radiation and fossils because of increased electricity consumption for biochar production. They also resulted in increased biomass demand to maintain energy production. The SFA indicated that leaching of PAH from the remediated soil was lower than from landfilled soil. For metal(loid)s, no straightforward conclusion could be made, as biochar had different effects on their leaching and for some elements the results were sensitive to water infiltration assumptions.

5661,pub.1140237908,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113470,34365182,,Assessing tree diversity and carbon storage during land use transitioning from shifting cultivation to indigenous agroforestry systems: Implications for REDD+ initiatives,"Indigenous agroforestry systems are important reservoirs of biodiversity, and ecosystem services with a potential contribution for conservation of biodiversity while sustaining the livelihood of the rural populace. Pineapple (Ananas comosus) agroforestry systems (PAFS) form an essential constituent of the rural landscape in the Indian Eastern Himalayas and other parts of Asia. The traditional PAFS management in southern Assam is unique in that it involves shifting cultivation transitioning from native forests to a PAFS. Scarcity of information on the functioning and services in terms of species diversity and carbon storage potential in the traditional PAFS has restricted the opportunities for consideration under the nature-based solutions of climate action including REDD+. Therefore, the present study assessed the tree diversity and ecosystem carbon storage in a chronosequence from swidden agriculture through different phases of PAFS establishment. The result demonstrated that basal area in the PAFS increased with age. The most dominant species in the native forests was Palaquium polyanthum, while agricultural land use and PAFS aged <5, 11-15 and > 15 years old were dominated by Gmelina arborea, Albizia procera, Areca catechu and Hevea brasiliensis, respectively. The highest value of Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H) was recorded in native forests (2.71), and lowest in 5-10 years old PAFS. The ecosystem carbon storage declined from 261.43 Mg ha-1 in native forests to 181.07 Mg ha-1 in <5-years old PAFS. In <5 years old PAFS, the ecosystem carbon storage was 30 % lower than the native forest; while at >15 years it was merely 5 % less than the native forests. The traditional PAFS maintains a steady ecosystem carbon stock while reducing land use related carbon emission and providing additional co-benefits to the communities. Therefore, the traditional PAFS constitute a good opportunity for REDD+.","Financial assistance received from Department of Science and Technology, Government of India through the research grant DST/CCP/MRDP/189/2019 is highly acknowledged.",,Journal of Environmental Management,,,Biodiversity; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Trees,2021-08-06,2021,2021-08-06,2021-11,298,,113470,Closed,Article,"Reang, Demsai; Hazarika, Animekh; Sileshi, Gudeta W; Pandey, Rajiv; Das, Ashesh Kumar; Nath, Arun Jyoti","Reang, Demsai (Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, Assam University, Silchar, India.); Hazarika, Animekh (Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, Assam University, Silchar, India.); Sileshi, Gudeta W (School of Agricultural, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Kwazulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; College of Natural and Computational Sciences, Addis Ababa University, P.O.

Although there are strong associations between plants and soil microorganisms, they may respond asynchronously to environmental factors and severe droughts. We aimed to: I) evaluate the special variation of soil microbiome such as microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), soil basal respiration (SBR) and microbial indexes in eight rangeland sites located across an aridity gradient (distributed from arid to mesic climates); II) analyze the relative importance of main environmental factors (climate, soils, and plants) and their relationships with microbial variables in the rangelands; and III) assess the effect of drought on microbial and plant variables in field-based manipulative experiments. First, we found significant changes of microbial variables along a precipitation and temperature gradient. The responses of MBC and MBN were strongly dependent on soil pH, soil nitrogen (N), soil organic carbon (SOC), C:N ratio and vegetation cover. In contrast, SBR was influenced by the aridity index (AI), the mean annual precipitation (MAP), the soil pH and vegetation cover. MBC, MBN and SBR were negatively related with soil pH compared to the other factors (C, N, C:N, vegetation cover, MAP and AI) that had a positive relationship. Second, we found a stronger soil microbial variables response to drought in arid sites compared to humid rangelands. Third, the responses of MBC, MBN, and SBR to drought showed positive relationships with vegetation cover and aboveground biomass, but with different regression slopes, this suggest that plant and microbial communities responded differently to drought. The results from this study improve our understanding about the microbial response to drought in different rangelands, and may facilitate the development of predictive models on responses of soil microorganisms in carbon cycle under global change scenarios.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

As a source of recalcitrant carbon, biochar has been widely used in agricultural soil as a mean of stabilizing soil organic carbon (SOC). However, limited reports focused on the changes of biochar itself in soil when compared with the bulk SOC after biochar addition. To explore how environmental conditions influence the stability of biochar, isolated straw-derived biochar particles (0.25-2 mm) were embedded in an Anthrosol for 12 months under varied environmental conditions of incubation temperature (15 °C, 25 °C and 35 °C) and moisture (60 % and 150 % of saturated water content). Within the early 1 month of incubation, pH and inorganic nitrogen contents of biochar changed significantly as a function of moisture and temperature (p < 0.01), whereas water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) content was only influenced by moisture content (p < 0.01). The highest temperature (35 °C) and saturated water content (150 %) induced the largest aging response reflected by increases in oxygen-containing surface functional groups of biochar, including C-O-C (51.35 % - 149 %) and N-C-O (65.55 % - 119 %). Pearson correlation and RDA analysis indicated that the chemical properties of biochar contribute more to the carbon-source utilization properties of biochar colonized microbial community within 1 month of incubation, while the bulk soil chemical properties (pH, DOC, MBC and NO3-) had a higher contribution until the end of incubation. Moisture rather than temperature was the dominant factor in regulating the functional diversity of biochar colonized microbial community.","This research was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [grant numbers 2018YFC1801100], the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 32071642], and a Basic Special Business Fund for RD for the Central Level Scientific Research Institutes, Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment [grant numbers GYZX210501].",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Carbon; Charcoal; Soil; Temperature; Water,2022-07-07,2022,2022-07-07,2022-11,845,,157219,Closed,Article,"Li, Ming; Long, Tao; Tian, Kang; Wei, Changlong; Liu, Ming; Wu, Meng; Li, Zhongpei; Uchimiya, Minori","Li, Ming (State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Soil Environmental Management and Pollution Control, Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China, Nanjing 210042, China.); Long, Tao (State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Soil Environmental Management and Pollution Control, Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China, Nanjing 210042, China.); Tian, Kang (CAS Key Laboratory of Soil Environment and Pollution Remediation, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China.); Wei, Changlong (CAS Key Laboratory of Soil Environment and Pollution Remediation, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China.); Liu, Ming (State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China.); Wu, Meng (State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China.); Li, Zhongpei (State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China.

Here, by conducting a meta-analysis of 150 studies, we show that short-term (<5 years) warming mainly affects soil labile carbon (LC) pools by changing bacterial community structure, while long-term (≥5 years) warming promotes the decomposition of recalcitrant C (RC) pools by increasing fungal biomass and decreasing actinobacterial biomass. Specifically, under short-term warming, significant increases in actinobacterial biomass (+15.9%) and the G+/G- ratio (+8.0%) were accompanied by an increase in carbon-degrading enzyme activities and a decrease in LC (-5.9%). Under long-term warming, the fungal biomass (+20.4%) and related POX (phenol oxidase) activity (+34.9%) increased significantly, while actinobacterial biomass (-20.1%), RC (-18.8%) and SOC (-6.7%) decreased. Meanwhile, we observed that warming impacts on soil microbial communities can be predicted by ecosystem type, the magnitude of warming, pH and elevation. Latitude and warming duration contributed the most to explaining the responses of LC and RC, respectively, across studies. Given that RC accounts for a substantial fraction of global soil C pools, the decline in RC pools greatly contributes to soil C degradation. Our findings suggest that different microbial groups may mediate the temporal dynamics of the decomposition of different soil C components and highlight that incorporating the temporal responses of soil microorganisms will improve predictions of the long-term dynamics of soil C pools in a warmer world.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1406402), the National Science Foundation of China (91951112, 41630528, 32030067 and 32101377), the Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader (21XD1420700), the Shanghai Pujiang Program (2020PJD003) and the Jiangsu Provincial Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (2021T140125).",The Science of The Total Environment,,,Carbon; Microbiota; Mycobiome; Soil; Soil Microbiology,2021-09-08,2021,2021-09-08,2022-01,804,,150197,Closed,Article,"Wang, Hui; Li, Jinquan; Chen, Hongyang; Liu, Hao; Nie, Ming","Wang, Hui (Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Science and Ecological Engineering, National Observations and Research Station for Wetland Ecosystems of the Yangtze Estuary, Institute of Biodiversity Science and Institute of Eco-Chongming, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.); Li, Jinquan (Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Science and Ecological Engineering, National Observations and Research Station for Wetland Ecosystems of the Yangtze Estuary, Institute of Biodiversity Science and Institute of Eco-Chongming, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.); Chen, Hongyang (Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Science and Ecological Engineering, National Observations and Research Station for Wetland Ecosystems of the Yangtze Estuary, Institute of Biodiversity Science and Institute of Eco-Chongming, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.); Liu, Hao (Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Science and Ecological Engineering, National Observations and Research Station for Wetland Ecosystems of the Yangtze Estuary, Institute of Biodiversity Science and Institute of Eco-Chongming, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.); Nie, Ming (Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Science and Ecological Engineering, National Observations and Research Station for Wetland Ecosystems of the Yangtze Estuary, Institute of Biodiversity Science and Institute of Eco-Chongming, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

While tropical forests exert a disproportionately large influence on global C cycling, there remains an open question on changes in below-ground soil C stocks with global increases in nitrogen (N) deposition, because N supply often does not constrain the growth of tropical forests. We quantified soil C sequestration through more than a decade of continuous N addition experiment in an N-rich primary tropical forest. Results showed that long-term N additions increased soil C stocks by 7 to 21%, mainly arising from decreased C output fluxes and physical protection mechanisms without changes in the chemical composition of organic matter. A meta-analysis further verified that soil C sequestration induced by excess N inputs is a general phenomenon in tropical forests. Notably, soil N sequestration can keep pace with soil C, based on consistent C/N ratios under N additions. These findings provide empirical evidence that below-ground C sequestration can be stimulated in mature tropical forests under excess N deposition, which has important implications for predicting future terrestrial sinks for both elevated anthropogenic CO2 and N deposition. We further developed a conceptual model hypothesis depicting how soil C sequestration happens under chronic N deposition in N-limited and N-rich ecosystems, suggesting a direction to incorporate N deposition and N cycling into terrestrial C cycle models to improve the predictability on C sink strength as enhanced N deposition spreads from temperate into tropical systems.","We thank Prof. Ivan Janssens (Antwerp University) and Dr. Bonnie Waring (Utah State University) for invaluable comments.

Yet our understanding of the stability of this vast carbon pool under global warming is uncertain. In particular, the fate of complex molecular structures (polymers) remains debated. Here we show that 4.5 years of whole-soil warming (+4 °C) resulted in less polymeric SOC (sum of specific polymers contributing to SOC) in the warmed subsoil (20–90 cm) relative to control, with no detectable change in topsoil. Warming stimulated the subsoil loss of lignin phenols (−17 ± 0%) derived from woody plant biomass, hydrolysable lipids cutin and suberin, derived from leaf and woody plant biomass (−28 ± 3%), and pyrogenic carbon (−37 ± 8%) produced during incomplete combustion. Given that these compounds have been proposed for long-term carbon sequestration, it is notable that they were rapidly lost in warmed soils. We conclude that complex polymeric carbon in subsoil is vulnerable to decomposition and propose that molecular structure alone may not protect compounds from degradation under future warming.","The research was supported by Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) project 172744 (DEEP C) awarded to M.W.I.S. and US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research under contract number DE-AC02-05CH11231 awarded to M.S.T.

Cattle operations are subject to criticism for their environmental burden, often based on incomplete information disseminated about their social, economic, nutritional, and ecological benefits and detriments. The 2019 data published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported that U.S. beef cattle emitted 22.6% of the total agricultural emissions, representing about 2.2% of the total anthropogenic emissions of CO2 equivalent (CO2e). Simulations from a computer model developed to address global energy and climate challenges, set to use extreme improvements in livestock and crop production systems, indicated a potential reduction in global CO2e emissions of 4.6% but without significant enhancement in the temperature change by 2030. There are many natural and anthropogenic sources of CH4 emissions. Contrary to the increased contribution of peatlands and water reservoirs to atmospheric CO2e, the steady decrease in the U.S. cattle population is estimated to have reduced its methane (CH4) emissions by about 30% from 1975 to 2021. This CH4 emission deacceleration of 2.46 Mt CO2e/yr2 might be even more significant than reported. Many opportunities exist to mitigate CH4 emissions of beef production, leading to a realistic prospect of a 5% to 15% reduction in the short term after considering the overlapping impacts of combined strategies. Reduction strategies include feeding synthetic chemicals that inactivate the methyl-coenzyme M reductase (the enzyme that catalyzes the last step of methanogenesis in the rumen), red seaweed or algae extracts, ionophore antibiotics, phytochemicals (e.g., condensed tannins and essential oils), and other nutritional manipulations. The proposed net-zero concept might not solve the global warming problem because it will only balance future anthropogenic GHG emissions with anthropogenic removals, leaving global warming on a standby state. Recommendations for consuming red meat products should consider human nutrition, health, and disease and remain independent of controversial evidence of causational relationships with perceived negative environmental impacts of beef production that are not based on scientific data.","The authors greatly appreciate the feedback received by researchers and colleagues during the preparation of this manuscript, in particular, Dr. Danny Fox (Cornell University), Dr. Michael Galyean (Texas Tech University), Dr. James Oltjen (University of California-Davis), and Dr. Karun Kaniyamattam (Texas A&amp;M University).

However, it remains unclear how the concentration and biodegradability of soil-derived DOC (extracted from pore water or soil leachates) vary over a global scale and what determines the variations in DOC concentration and biodegradability. Here we addressed this issue by synthesizing the dataset involved in 121 sites from 39 literatures worldwide, and analyzed the patterns and drivers of DOC concentration and biodegradability. Our results showed that the DOC concentration in either pore water or soil leachates varied considerably, with mean values of 33.2 mg L-1 in pore water and 213.5 mg kg-1 in soil leachates, respectively. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) was the dominant control on the variability in soil-derived DOC concentration. Our results also revealed that the biodegradability of DOC in pore water was significantly lower than that in soil leachates, with the means of 16.5% versus 28.7%, respectively. Specific UV absorbance (SUVA254, a parameter used for evaluating dissolved aromatic carbon content) was the primary indicator predicting the spatial variation in DOC biodegradability, whereas MAP exerted limited effects on DOC biodegradability. These results demonstrate the high biodegradability of soil-derived DOC, highlighting its crucial role in the global carbon cycle under climate change.","We gratefully acknowledge the editor and four anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments on this manuscript.

The amount of C stored in soil depends on the input of organic matter into the soil, but also on quality of the organic matter, which determines the proportion of organic matter that remains in the soil or that is released from the soil as CO2. Here, we present a quantitative review of common garden experiments in which various tree species were planted alongside each other. The main goals of the study were to determine whether: 1) the amount of sequestered C under broadleaf and coniferous trees could be affected by soil age and previous land use; 2) the C:N ratio of leaf litter is correlated with the amount of sequestered C; 3) the amount of sequestered C under broadleaf and coniferous trees could be affected by pH and clay content. We found that the effects of broadleaf and coniferous trees on soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration differed with the stage of soil development. We used soils with different previous land uses as a representative of different stages of soil development. Forest soils and agricultural soils represent soils in later stages of soil development and post-mining soils represent soils in early stages of development. In forest soils, more SOC was stored under coniferous trees than under broadleaf trees. In post-mining soils the opposite trend was found, i.e., more SOC was stored under broadleaf than coniferous trees. In afforested agricultural soils, SOC sequestration did not differ between broadleaf and coniferous trees. SOC sequestration under broadleaf trees was highest in soils with high pH. SOC sequestration was negatively correlated with the litter C:N ratio in post-mining soils but not in other more mature soils. Similarly, SOC sequestration was negatively correlated with the litter C:N in alkaline soils and in soils with high clay content. These results suggest that dominant SOC sequestration mechanisms change with stage of soil development such that SOC storage is greater under broadleaf trees in immature soils but is greater under coniferous trees in mature soils.","The study was supported by LIFE-IP: N2K Revisited project (LIFE17IPE/CZ/000005) supported by European commission.

However, due to the short-term nature of CO2 enrichment experiments and the lack of reconciliation between different ecological scales, the effect of e[CO2 ] on plant biomass stocks remains a major uncertainty in future climate projections. Here, we review the effect of e[CO2 ] on plant biomass across multiple levels of ecological organization, scaling from physiological responses to changes in population-, community-, ecosystem-, and global-scale dynamics. We find that evidence for a sustained biomass response to e[CO2 ] varies across ecological scales, leading to diverging conclusions about the responses of individuals, populations, communities, and ecosystems. While the distinct focus of every scale reveals new mechanisms driving biomass accumulation under e[CO2 ], none of them provides a full picture of all relevant processes. For example, while physiological evidence suggests a possible long-term basis for increased biomass accumulation under e[CO2 ] through sustained photosynthetic stimulation, population-scale evidence indicates that a possible e[CO2 ]-induced increase in mortality rates might potentially outweigh the effect of increases in plant growth rates on biomass levels. Evidence at the global scale may indicate that e[CO2 ] has contributed to increased biomass cover over recent decades, but due to the difficulty to disentangle the effect of e[CO2 ] from a variety of climatic and land-use-related drivers of plant biomass stocks, it remains unclear whether nutrient limitations or other ecological mechanisms operating at finer scales will dampen the e[CO2 ] effect over time. By exploring these discrepancies, we identify key research gaps in our understanding of the effect of e[CO2 ] on plant biomass and highlight the need to integrate knowledge across scales of ecological organization so that large-scale modeling can represent the finer-scale mechanisms needed to constrain our understanding of future terrestrial C storage.","JM was funded by grants to TWC from DOB Ecology, LCA by the FORMAS grant 2017‐00423 and the strategic research area BECC (Biodiversity and Ecosystem services in a Changing Climate), CMZ by the Ambizione grant PZ00P3_193646, PBR by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Long‐Term Ecological Research (LTER) grant DEB‐1831944, LTREB DEB‐1753859, and Biological Integration Institutes grant NSF‐DBI‐2021898, KZ by the NSF grants DEB‐1926438 and DEB‐2045309.

However, few quantitative outdoor experiments have been performed that describe how these soil modifying earthworms are reshaping structures in tundra soils. In this study, we used three-dimensional (3-D) X-ray images of soil cores (approximately 10 cm diameter, 20 cm height, N = 48) to assess how earthworms (Aporrectodea sp. and Lumbricus sp.) affect soil structure and macropore networks in an outdoor mesocosm experiment that lasted four summers. Effects were assessed in both shrub-dominated (heath) and herb-dominated (meadow) tundra. Earthworms almost doubled the macroporosity in meadow soils and tripled macroporosity in heath. Interestingly, the fractal dimension of macropores decreased in response to earthworm burrowing in both systems, indicating that the presence of earthworms reduced the geometric complexity in comparison to other pore-generating processes active in the tundra. Observed effects on soil structure occurred along with a dramatically reduced soil moisture content, which was observed the first winter after earthworm introduction in the meadow. Our findings suggest that predictions of future changes in vegetation and soil carbon pools in the Arctic should include major impacts on soil properties that earthworms induce.",Funding for this research was provided to JKl from the Swedish Research Council (dnr 2017-04548) and FORMAS (dnr 2018-01312).,,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Animals; Humans; Soil; Oligochaeta; Ecosystem; Tundra; Carbon,2022-11-12,2022,2022-11-12,2023-02,859,Pt 2,160125,Closed,Article,"Klaminder, J.; Krab, E.J.; Larsbo, M.; Jonsson, H.; Fransson, J.; Koestel, J.","Klaminder, J.

Synthetic fertilizers have been long used to improve the productivity of agricultural soils, part of which leaches into the environment and emits greenhouse gasses (GHG). Some fundamental challenges within agricultural practices include the improvement of water retention and microbiota in soils, as well as boosting the efficiency of fertilizers. Biochar is a nutrient rich material produced from biomass, gaining attention for soil amendment purposes, improving crop yields as well as for carbon sequestration. This study summarizes the potential benefits of biochar applications, placing emphasis on its application in the agricultural sector. It seems biochar used for soil amendment improves nutrient density of soils, water holding capacity, reduces fertilizer requirements, enhances soil microbiota, and increases crop yields. Additionally, biochar usage has many environmental benefits, economic benefits, and a potential role to play in carbon credit systems. Biochar (also known as biocarbon) may hold the answer to these fundamental requirements.","This study has also benefited from the facility funding to the Bioproducts Discovery and Development Centre, University of Guelph supported by FedDev Ontario, Canada; OMAFRA Canada; the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI); Federal Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund (SIF), Canada; and Bank of Montreal (BMO).","(i) The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA)-Canada/University of Guelph-Bioeconomy for Industrial Uses Research Program Theme (Project Nos. 030331, 030332); (ii) the Ontario Research Fund, Research Excellence Program; Round-7 (ORF-RE07) from the Ontario Ministry of Research Innovation and Science (MRIS), Canada (Project Nos. 052644 and 052665); and (iii) the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Canada Discovery Grants (Project Nos. 401111); and (iv) the NSERC, Canada Research Chair (CRC) program Project No. 460788.",Molecules,,"Farid Chemat, Elena Ibáñez, Sylvain Antoniotti",Agriculture; Charcoal,2021-09-14,2021,2021-09-14,,26,18,5584,All OA; Gold,Article,"Allohverdi, Tara; Mohanty, Amar Kumar; Roy, Poritosh; Misra, Manjusri","Allohverdi, Tara (Bioproducts Discovery and Development Centre, Department of Plant Agriculture, Crop Science Building, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada;, tallohve@uoguelph.ca, (T.A.);, poritosh@uoguelph.ca, (P.R.)); Mohanty, Amar Kumar (Bioproducts Discovery and Development Centre, Department of Plant Agriculture, Crop Science Building, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada;, tallohve@uoguelph.ca, (T.A.);, poritosh@uoguelph.ca, (P.R.); School of Engineering, Thornbrough Building, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada); Roy, Poritosh (Bioproducts Discovery and Development Centre, Department of Plant Agriculture, Crop Science Building, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada;, tallohve@uoguelph.ca, (T.A.);, poritosh@uoguelph.ca, (P.R.); School of Engineering, Thornbrough Building, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada); Misra, Manjusri (Bioproducts Discovery and Development Centre, Department of Plant Agriculture, Crop Science Building, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada;, tallohve@uoguelph.ca, (T.A.);, poritosh@uoguelph.ca, (P.R.); School of Engineering, Thornbrough Building, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada)","Mohanty, Amar Kumar (University of Guelph; ; University of Guelph); Misra, Manjusri (University of Guelph; ; University of Guelph)","Allohverdi, Tara (University of Guelph); Mohanty, Amar Kumar (University of Guelph; University of Guelph); Roy, Poritosh (University of Guelph; University of Guelph); Misra, Manjusri (University of Guelph; University of Guelph)",28,28,1.42,7.8,https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/18/5584/pdf?version=1631668294,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141135525,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry; 3405 Organic Chemistry,15 Life on Land; 2 Zero Hunger

A case study in an arid island,"The plantation of exotic species has been a common practice in (semi-) arid areas worldwide aiming to restore highly degraded habitats. The effects of these plantations on plant cover or soil erosion have been widely studied, while little attention has been paid to the consequences on soil quality and belowground biological communities. This study evaluates the long-term (>60 years) effects of the exotic species Acacia cyclops and Pinus halepensis revegetation on soil properties, including microbiome, in an arid island. Soils under exotic plantation were compared to both degraded soils with a very low cover of native species and soils with well-preserved native plant communities. Seven scenarios were selected in a small area (~25 ha) with similar soil type but differing in the plant cover. Topsoils (0-15 cm) were analyzed for physical, chemical and biochemical properties, and amplicon sequencing of bacterial and fungal communities. Microbial diversity was similar among soils with exotic plants and native vegetation (Shannon's index = 5.26 and 5.34, respectively), while the most eroded soils exhibited significantly lower diversity levels (Shannon's index = 4.72). Bacterial and fungal communities' composition in degraded soils greatly differed from those in vegetated soils (Canberra index = 0.85 and 0.92, respectively) likely due to high soil sodicity, fine textures and compaction. Microbial communities' composition also differed in soils covered with exotic and native species, to a greater extent for fungi than for bacteria (Canberra index = 0.94 and 0.89, respectively), due to higher levels of nutrients, microbial biomass and activity in soils with native species. Results suggest that reforestation succeeded in avoiding further soil degradation but still leading to relevant changes in soil microbial community that may have negative effects on ecosystem stability. Information gained in this research could be useful for environmental agencies and decision makers about the controversial replacement of exotic plants in insular territories.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

5652,pub.1147188832,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.134662,35447206,,A re-analysis of NH4 + sorption on biochar: Have expectations been too high?,"Sorption of nutrients such as NH4+ is often quoted as a critical property of biochar, explaining its value as a soil amendment and a filter material. However, published values for NH4+ sorption to biochar vary by more than 3 orders of magnitude, without consensus as to the source of this variability. This lack of understanding greatly limits our ability to use quantitative sorption measurements towards product design. Here, our objective was to conduct a quantitative analysis of the sources of variability, and infer which biochar traits are more favourable to high sorption capacity. To do so, we conducted a standardized remodelling exercise of published batch sorption studies using Langmuir sorption isotherm. We excluded studies presenting datasets that either could not be reconciled with the standard Langmuir sorption isotherm or generated clear outliers. Our analysis indicates that the magnitude of sorption capacity of unmodified biochar for NH4+ is lower than previously reported, with a median of 4.2 mg NH4+ g-1 and a maximum reported sorption capacity of 22.8 mg NH4+ g-1. Activation resulted in a significant relative improvement in sorption capacity, but absolute improvements remain modest, with a maximum reported sorption of 27.56 mg NH4+ g-1 for an activated biochar. Methodology appeared to substantially impact sorption estimates, especially practices such as pH control of batch sorption solution and ash removal.

These particles have high active surface area, unique chemical properties, and can enter cells. Humanity uses many ENMs for their biological reactivity (e.g. microbicides), but their environmental effects are complex. We cataloged 2102 experimental results on whole organisms for 22 particle classes (mainly on Ag, Zn, Ti, and Cu) to assess biological responses, effective and lethal concentrations, and bioaccumulation of ENMs. Most responses were negative and varied significantly by particle type, functional group of organism, and type of response. Smaller particles tended to be more toxic. Aquatic organisms responded more negatively than did terrestrial organisms. Animals generally were most sensitive and plants least. Silver ENMs generally had the strongest negative effects. Effective and lethal concentrations generally exceeded modeled environmentally relevant concentrations and organisms usually did not accumulate or biomagnify to concentrations above those in their environment. However, most experiments lasted less than a week and were not field studies. Research to date is probably insufficient to understand chronic effects and long-term biomagnification. Numerous unique and untested ENMs continue to enter environments at accelerating rates, and our analysis indicates potential for negative effects. Our data suggest substantial research is still required to understand the ultimate influence of ENMs as they continue to accumulate in the environment. Around 40% of the papers with experimental data for ENMs failed with respect to reporting means, sample sizes, or experimental error, or they did not have proper experimental design (e.g. lack of true controls). We need more high-quality experiments that are more realistic (field or mesocosm), longer duration, contain a wider range of organisms, and account for complex food web structure.","We thank Rachel Keen, Crosby Hedden, Hannah Dea, and Benjamin Wiens for project development, data harvesting, and contributing to early drafts.

A comprehensive exploration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in response to DWCs can help summarize the existing results and better estimate terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions under the intensified drought and precipitation variations. This meta-analysis based on soil emissions of CO2 (868 observations, 29 studies) and N2O (52 observations, 19 studies) at the global scale investigated the direction and intensity of the changes in soil CO2 and N2O emissions in response to DWCs as controlled by experimental variables including land use type, soil texture, soil nutrients, and frequency and duration of DWCs. The results showed that, compared to the constant soil water content, DWCs led to the increase in CO2 emissions by 35.7% (95% confidence intervals ranging from 0.300 to 0.415), whereas it had no significant effect on N2O emissions (-0.2638 to 1.4751). The random-effects model indicated that soil water-filled pore space during wetting, soil clay content, days of drying and wetting, and frequency of DWCs significantly affected CO2 and N2O emissions in response to DWCs. Furthermore, potential biotic and abiotic factors affecting soil CO2 and N2O emissions under DWCs are also summarized, and it was proposed that mobility and availability of carbon substrate as well as enhanced microbial activity and abundance are the main drivers facilitating soil CO2 and N2O emissions in response to DWCs. However, soil gas diffusion or oxygen availability also dominated soil N2O emissions under DWCs. Overall, this study improves our understanding of soil CO2 and N2O emissions in response to various DWC scenarios and facilitates the development of better greenhouse gas mitigation strategies against the background of a rapidly changing climate.","We appreciate the researchers whose data were involved in this study.

The response may depend on whether C is unprotected, isolated within aggregates, or protected from decomposition by mineral associations. Here, we present a global synthesis of the relative influence of environmental factors on soil organic C partitioning among pools, abundance in each pool (mg C g-1  soil), and persistence (as approximated by radiocarbon abundance) in relatively unprotected particulate and protected mineral-bound pools. We show that C within particulate and mineral-associated pools consistently differed from one another in degree of persistence and relationship to environmental factors. Soil depth was the best predictor of C abundance and persistence, though it accounted for more variance in persistence. Persistence of all C pools decreased with increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) throughout the soil profile, whereas persistence increased with increasing wetness index (MAP/PET) in subsurface soils (30-176 cm). The relationship of C abundance (mg C g-1  soil) to climate varied among pools and with depth. Mineral-associated C in surface soils (<30 cm) increased more strongly with increasing wetness index than the free particulate C, but both pools showed attenuated responses to the wetness index at depth. Overall, these relationships suggest a strong influence of climate on soil C properties, and a potential loss of soil C from protected pools in areas with decreasing wetness. Relative persistence and abundance of C pools varied significantly among land cover types and soil parent material lithologies. This variability in each pool's relationship to environmental factors suggests that not all soil organic C is equally vulnerable to global change. Therefore, projections of future soil organic C based on patterns and responses of bulk soil organic C may be misleading.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Essential support for this project came from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis Working Group on Soil Carbon: “What lies below?

Nonetheless, previous reports on impacts of NT on nitrate (   NO 3 -    ) leaching are inconsistent. A global meta-analysis was conducted to test the hypothesis that the response of   NO 3 -    leaching under NT, relative to tillage, is associated with tillage type (inversion vs non-inversion tillage), soil properties (e.g., soil organic carbon [SOC]), climate factors (i.e., water input), and management practices (e.g., NT duration and nitrogen fertilizer inputs). Overall, compared with all forms of tillage combined, NT had 4% and 14% greater area-scaled and yield-scaled   NO 3 -    leaching losses, respectively. The   NO 3 -    leaching under NT tended to be 7% greater than that of inversion tillage but comparable to non-inversion tillage. Greater   NO 3 -    leaching under NT, compared with inversion tillage, was most evident under short-duration NT (<5 years), where water inputs were low (<2 mm day-1 ), in medium texture and low SOC (<1%) soils, and at both higher (>200 kg ha-1 ) and lower (0-100 kg ha-1 ) rates of nitrogen addition. Of these, SOC was the most important factor affecting the risk of NO3 - leaching under NT compared with inversion tillage. Globally, on average, the greater amount of NO3 - leached under NT, compared with inversion tillage, was mainly attributed to corresponding increases in drainage. The percentage of global cropping land with lower risk of NO3 - leaching under NT, relative to inversion tillage, increased with NT duration from 3 years (31%) to 15 years (54%). This study highlighted that the benefits of NT adoption for mitigating   NO 3 -    leaching are most likely in long-term NT cropping systems on high-SOC soils.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Lincoln University, The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited, the New Zealand‐China Water Research Centre, and the China Scholarship Council (File no. 201906300090) supported this study.

This study aimed at showing the spatial and temporal variations in carbon storage and valuation in the upper Omo Gibe Basin. Land use/cover and carbon pool data based on field data collection and laboratory analyses supported by GIS and remote sensing were used. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) software was used for modelling carbon storage. The Global voluntary carbon market price and Tropical Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) data were used for describing carbon storage in economic terms. ANOVA was carried out to detect significant differences in carbon stock correlation with parameters. The results show that the annual carbon stock declined by 0.37 t/ha and the carbon market declined from USD 25.04 billion in 1988 to USD 24.01 billion in 2018. The highest loss of carbon storage and valuation was found in forest land followed by grazing land. Moreover, carbon stock was positively correlated with NDVI and habitat quality (p < 0.05). Slopes did not affect carbon stock (p > 0.05).

However, it can be a contamination source of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). The present study aimed to investigate the concentration of PTEs such as arsenic (As), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and Iron (Fe) in various fresh and processed fruits. All the studies related to the concentration of PTEs in fresh and processed fruits by international databases including were included and non-carcinogenic risks assessment was evaluated based on the total hazard quotient (TTHQ). According to findings highest concentrations of As, Cd and Pb were observed in pineapple, mango, and cherry, while the lowest concentrations of these metals were found in berries, pineapple, and berries. Regarding trace elements, peach and cucumber represented the highest and lowest concentrations of Fe, respectively. Moreover, the highest and lowest concentrations of Cu were related to plum and banana, respectively. Considering the type of continents, the highest concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, Fe, Ni, and Cu among fresh and processed fruits belonged to Pan American Health Organization (EMRO), EMRO, African Region (AFRO), European Region (EURO), AFRO, and Western Pacific Region (SEARO). Eventually, the non-carcinogenic risk assessment of the heavy metal in fresh and processed fruits indicated that the risk pattern was different in various countries and the calculated TTHQ level in infants was below 1. Overall, the consumption of fresh and processed fruits is safe and does not pose a risk to the health of consumers.",,"The authors received financial support for this research from the Deputy of Research and Technology, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences.",Biological Trace Element Research,,,"Humans; Arsenic; Cadmium; Environmental Monitoring; Fruit; Lead; Metals, Heavy; Nickel; Risk Assessment; Soil Pollutants",2022-06-21,2022,2022-06-21,2023-05,201,5,2582-2596,Closed,Article,"Einolghozati, Mahtab; Talebi-Ghane, Elaheh; Khazaei, Mohammad; Mehri, Fereshteh","Einolghozati, Mahtab (Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, School of Medicine, Nutrition Health Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran); Talebi-Ghane, Elaheh (Modeling of Noncommunicable Diseases Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran); Khazaei, Mohammad (Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Research Center for Health Sciences, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran); Mehri, Fereshteh (Nutrition Health Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran)","Mehri, Fereshteh (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences)","Einolghozati, Mahtab (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences); Talebi-Ghane, Elaheh (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences); Khazaei, Mohammad (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences); Mehri, Fereshteh (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences)",3,3,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148835838,31 Biological Sciences; 3102 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,

However, studies focussed on the consequences of decomposition for plant communities largely ignore soil fauna across all ecosystems, because microbes are often considered the primary agents of decay. Here, we explore the role of invertebrates as not simply facilitators of microbial decomposition, but as true decomposers, able to break down dead organic matter with their own endogenic enzymes, with direct and indirect impacts on the soil environment and plants. We recommend a holistic view of decomposition, highlighting how invertebrates and microbes act in synergy to degrade organic matter, providing ecological services that underpin plant growth and survival.","We are grateful to the three reviewers and editor, Amy Austin, who provided valuable feedback that greatly improved the manuscript.

5646,pub.1148755503,10.1111/gcb.16307,35713970,,Subarctic soil carbon losses after deforestation for agriculture depend on permafrost abundance,"The northern circumpolar permafrost region is experiencing considerable warming due to climate change, which is allowing agricultural production to expand into regions of discontinuous and continuous permafrost. The conversion of forests to arable land might further enhance permafrost thaw and affect soil organic carbon (SOC) that had previously been protected by frozen ground. The interactive effect of permafrost abundance and deforestation on SOC stocks has hardly been studied. In this study, soils were sampled on 18 farms across the Yukon on permafrost and non-permafrost soils to quantify the impact of land-use change from forest to cropland and grassland on SOC stocks. Furthermore, the soils were physically and chemically fractionated to assess the impact of land-use change on different functional pools of SOC. On average, permafrost-affected forest soils lost 15.6 ± 21.3% of SOC when converted to cropland and 23.0 ± 13.0% when converted to grassland. No permafrost was detected in the deforested soils, indicating that land-use change strongly enhanced warming and subsequent thawing. In contrast, the change in SOC at sites without permafrost was not significant but had a slight tendency to be positive. SOC stocks were generally lower at sites without permafrost under forest. Furthermore, land-use change increased mineral-associated SOC, while the fate of particulate organic matter (POM) after land-use change depended on permafrost occurrence. Permafrost soils showed significant POM losses after land-use change, while grassland sites without permafrost gained POM in the topsoil. The results showed that the fate of SOC after land-use change greatly depended on the abundance of permafrost in the pristine forest, which was driven by climatic conditions more than by soil properties. It can be concluded that in regions of discontinuous permafrost in particular, initial conditions in forest soils should be considered before deforestation to minimize its climate impact.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank all the farmers for giving us the opportunity to take samples from their land and for providing many useful insights about subarctic agriculture.

Yet, the influence of organic amendments on microbial diversity remains uncertain, and few studies have addressed the relative importance of microbial diversity versus other drivers of crop yields. Here, we synthesize 219 studies worldwide and found that organic amendments significantly increased microbial diversity components (i.e., Shannon, richness, and phylogenetic diversity) and shifted microbial community structure compared to mineral-only fertilization. The performance of microbial alpha diversity varied substantially with organic amendment types, microbial groups and changes in soil pH. Both microbial diversity and community structure exhibited significantly positive relationships with microbial functionality and crop yields. In addition, soil abiotic properties and microbial functionality had a much stronger impact on crop yields than microbial diversity and climate factors. Partial least squares path modeling showed that soil microbial diversity was an important underlying factor driving crop yields via boosting soil microbial functionality. Overall, our findings provide robust evidence for the positive diversity-functions relationships, emphasizing that substituting mineral fertilizers with organic amendments is a promising way to conserve microbial diversity and promote soil microbial functions and crop yields.","We thank the anonymous reviewers for their critical review and comments.

However, previous studies have mainly focused on the impacts of single-species grazing on grassland biodiversity and ecosystem functions; the effects of mixed grazing of cattle and sheep remain largely unknown. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the impacts of mixed grazing and analyzed the relative roles of cattle and sheep on grassland biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions. Mixed grazing studies mainly originated from Europe, the USA, and China. Generally, cattle and sheep exhibited distinctive impacts on grassland biodiversity and functions in single-species and mixed grazing regimes. Cattle grazing alone increased plant diversity and soil organic carbon content (SOC), while sheep grazing alone had little impact. Compared to single-species grazing, mixed grazing generally increased plant density and richness of insect herbivores and decreased soil nematode richness, but did not alter plant biomass, soil nitrogen, or nematode abundance. Cattle in the mixed grazing regime increased plant diversity, biomasses of forbs and legumes, SOC, and liveweight gains of livestock. The mixed grazing impacts were further regulated by climate conditions, grazing intensity, and grazing duration. Our findings provide compelling evidence that mixed grazing benefits biodiversity, soil carbon sequestration, livestock production, and community structure of grasslands, and cattle are more influential than sheep in creating the benefits of mixed grazing for sustainable management of grasslands.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

On this base, we explore the influence of the combination of liquid artificial humic acid (LA-HA) and freezing-thawing events on strengthening carbon sequestration in soils. The measurements of the total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content illustrate that the applications of LA-HA indeed largely enhanced the persistent carbon reservoirs during freezing-thawing cycles, and the highest TOC net increment was found as up to 4000 mg/kg (0.36 wt% C with the control treatment versus 0.79 wt% C with 300 mL/kg LA-HA (3LA-HA) treatment after 10 freezing-thawing cycles). Spectral analysis reveals that LA-HA treatments accelerated the formation of additional humic substances under freezing-thawing events, i.e., the transformation of labile carbon to resistant carbon. Finally, the results of highthroughput sequencing corresponding to cbbL gene demonstrate that 3LA-HA functioned to optimizing the community structure of carbon sequestration bacteria and improving the dominant position of part bacteria with strong carbon fixation ability to reduce soil carbon loss after thawing, e.g., Mycolicibacterium gadium and Starkeya novella.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, the effects of differing optical and radar sensors on SOC prediction models remain uncertain. This research aims to investigate the effects of different optical and radar sensors (Sentinel-1/2/3 and ALOS-2) on SOC prediction models based on long-term satellite observations on the GEE platform. We also evaluate the relative impact of four synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisition configurations (polarization mode, band frequency, orbital direction and time window) on SOC mapping with multiband SAR data from Spain. Twelve experiments involving different satellite data configurations, combined with 4027 soil samples, were used for building SOC random forest regression models. The results show that the synthesis mode and choice of satellite images, as well as the SAR acquisition configurations, influenced the model accuracy to varying degrees. Models based on SAR data involving cross-polarization, multiple time periods and ""ASCENDING"" orbits outperformed those involving copolarization, a single time period and ""DESCENDING"" orbits. Moreover, combining information from different orbital directions and polarization modes improved the soil prediction models. Among the SOC models based on long-term satellite observations, the Sentinel-3-based models (R2 = 0.40) performed the best, while the ALOS-2-based model performed the worst. In addition, the predictive performance of MSI/Sentinel-2 (R2 = 0.35) was comparable with that of SAR/Sentinel-1 (R2 = 0.35); however, the combination (R2 = 0.39) of the two improved the model performance. All the predicted maps involving Sentinel satellites had similar spatial patterns that were higher in northwest Spain and lower in the south. Overall, this study provides insights into the effects of different optical and radar sensors and radar system parameters on soil prediction models and improves our understanding of the potential of Sentinels in developing soil carbon mapping.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

A total of 2,612 Exact Sequence Variants (ESVs) included 517 annotated as putative species and 694 as genera which together captured 57.7% of the 3,133,873 sequences, with the most abundant species being Thermobifida fusca, Thermomonospora chromogena and Thermobifida bifida. Compost properties changed rapidly over time alongside the diversity of the compost community, which increased as composting progressed, and multivariate analysis indicated significant variation in community composition between each time-point. The abundance of bacteria in the feedstock is strongly correlated with the presence of organic matter and the abundance of plant cell wall components. Temperature and pH are the most strongly correlated parameters with bacterial abundance in the thermophilic and cooling phases/mature compost respectively. Differential abundance analysis revealed 810 ESVs annotated as species significantly varied in relative abundance between Litter and Young phase, 653 between the Young and Middle phases, 1182 between Middle and Aged phases and 663 between Aged phase and mature Compost. These changes indicated that structural carbohydrates and lignin degrading species were abundant at the beginning of the thermophilic phase, especially members of the Firmicute and Actinobacteria phyla. A high diversity of species capable of putative ammonification and denitrification were consistently found throughout the composting phases, whereas a limited number of nitrifying bacteria were identified and were significantly enriched within the later mesophilic composting phases. High microbial community resolution also revealed unexpected species which could be beneficial for agricultural soils enriched with mature compost or for the deployment of environmental and plant biotechnologies. Understanding the dynamics of these microbial communities could lead to improved waste management strategies and the development of input-specific composting protocols to optimize carbon and nitrogen transformation and promote a diverse and functional microflora in mature compost.",Special thanks to Jocelyne Ayotte for her help with the physicochemical analyses and Joan Laur for her support.

Location: Global.
Time period: Contemporary.
Major taxa studied: Plants, phytoplankton, macroalgae, invertebrates, vertebrates and zooplankton.
Methods: Data from >500 studies were combined to estimate nitrogen stocks and fluxes in green-brown food webs in forests, grasslands, brackish environments, seagrass meadows, lakes and oceans. We compared the stocks, fluxes and metabolic rates of different functional groups within each food web. We also used these estimates to build a dynamical model to test the response of the ecosystems to nutrient enrichment.
Results: We found surprising symmetries between the green and brown channels across ecosystems, in their stocks, fluxes and consumption coefficients and mortality rates. We also found that nitrogen enrichment, either organic or inorganic, can disrupt this balance between the green and brown channels.
Main conclusions: Linking green and brown food webs reveals a previously hidden symmetry between herbivory and detritivory, which appears to be a widespread property of natural ecosystems but can be disrupted by anthropogenic nitrogen additions.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Matthieu Barbier and Vasilis Dakos for helpful comments on the manuscript.

We developed a systematic framework to mine data from existing publications and compiled an antibiotic concentration-based dataset containing 439 samples from 30 bays, and compared antibiotics across bays and matrices (water, sediment, and biota). Antibiotic concentrations varied considerably between bays, with hotspots occurring in East Asia. The main categories of antibiotics in waters included sulfonamide and macrolide, while tetracycline, quinolone, and macrolide antibiotics were prevalent in sediments. The main sources of antibiotics in bays included sewage treatment plant effluent, domestic sewage, agriculture runoff, and discharges from mariculture activities. Antibiotics with high ecological risks mainly included sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and oxytetracycline. Erythromycin posed a considerable risk to human health, and the human health risks presented by other antibiotics were negligible. Regional variations of concentrations correspond to the uneven geographic consumption of antibiotics and their removal rate during wastewater treatment. Differences in antibiotics' composition between matrices are associated mainly with the physicochemical properties of antibiotics (e.g., molecular structure, solubility, and stability) and the content of total organic carbon, metal ions, chlorophyll a, and clay minerals in the sediments. To reduce the ecological and human health implications, priority should be given to the removal of erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, oxytetracycline, and clarithromycin, with a special focus on their treatment in the Asian bay areas.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This work was supported financially by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (MSTC) with National Key Research and Development Program (2017YFE0119000), Key Collaborative Research Program of the Alliance of International Science Organizations (ANSO-CR-KP-2020–03), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) with Young Scientists Programs (31300397).

CSV86: an ideal host/candidate for metabolic engineering and bioremediation,"Pseudomonas sp. CSV86, an Indian soil isolate, degrades wide range of aromatic compounds like naphthalene, benzoate and phenylpropanoids, amongst others. Isolate displays the unique and novel property of preferential utilization of aromatics over glucose and co-metabolizes them with organic acids. Interestingly, as compared to other Pseudomonads, strain CSV86 harbours only high-affinity glucokinase pathway (and absence of low-affinity oxidative route) for glucose metabolism. Such lack of gluconate loop might be responsible for the novel phenotype of preferential utilization of aromatics. The genome analysis and comparative functional mining indicated a large genome (6.79 Mb) with significant enrichment of regulators, transporters as well as presence of various secondary metabolite production clusters, suggesting its eco-physiological and metabolic versatility. Strain harbours various integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) and genomic islands, probably acquired through horizontal gene transfer events, leading to genome mosaicity and plasticity. Naphthalene degradation genes are arranged as regulonic clusters and found to be part of ICECSV86nah . Various eco-physiological properties and absence of major pathogenicity and virulence factors (risk group-1) in CSV86 suggest it to be an ideal candidate for bioremediation. Further, strain can serve as an ideal chassis for metabolic engineering to degrade various xenobiotics preferentially over simple carbon sources for efficient remediation.","P.S.P. thanks DBT, DST and BRNS, Govt. of India for research funding.

Here, a metagenomic analysis of C related genes along five elevations ranging from 767 to 4190 m at Mount Kilimanjaro was analysed to evaluate the microbial organic C transformation capacities in various ecosystems. The highest gene abundances for decomposition of moderate mineralizable compounds, i.e. carbohydrate esters, chitin and pectin were found at the mid-elevations with hump-shaped pattern, where the genes for decompositions of recalcitrant C (i.e. lignin) and easily mineralizable C (i.e. starch) showed the opposite trend (i.e. U-shaped pattern), due to high soil pH and seasonality in both low and high elevations. Notably, the gene abundances for the decompositions of starch, carbohydrate esters, chitin and lignin had positive relationships with corresponding C compounds, indicating the consistent responses of microbial functional profiles and metabolites to elevation climosequences. Understanding of adaptation of microbial communities, potential function and metabolites to elevation climosequences and their influencing factors provided a new insight for the regulation of terrestrial C storage.","This study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (41807033, 41721001), the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (2018QNRC001) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China.

However, it is unclear which factors determine the effect sizes of fertilization on PTTEs at the multiple spatial-temporal scale. This work synthesized 379 observations in 78 field sites (3-35 years) across China's main grain producing areas, and showed that long-term organic fertilization significantly enhanced total Cu, Zn and Cd by 25.7%, 18.9% and 66.6%, and soil available Cu, Zn and Cd by 60.5%, 155.3% and 83.6%, respectively; whereas long-term inorganic fertilization increased only available Cu, Zn and Cd by an average of 6.3%. Organic fertilizer (OF) type and application rate dominated the variation of PTTE concentrations, where approximately one-half of Cd pollution (42.6% of total Cd and 47% of available Cd) was observed. Furthermore, OFs containing Cd less than 1 mg kg-1 were recommended to be safely applied to agricultural soils. Soil type was main factor under long-term inorganic fertilization determining available PTTE variation, resulted in higher pollution risk in some soils such as Alfisols and Semi-hydromorphic soils, where we suggested the use of lower amounts of P fertilizers or the application of ones having small amounts of PTTEs. In short, long-term organic fertilization caused serious pollution of PTTEs especially Cd in Chinese croplands, and some strategies with a focus towards reducing the pollution risk must be developed, e.g., promoting straw return, forbidding Cd addition to feeds and feed additives, and improving carbon sequestration efficiency (CSE) of OFs and thus soil organic matter (SOM).","We thank all scientific research workers for their continuing efforts working on Chinese long-term field experiments.

While some studies have investigated the effects of MPs on soil nitrogen content, the underlying physicochemical and microbial driving mechanisms still need to be explored. In this study, a six-month incubation experiment was conducted with varying polyethylene MP addition rates: CK (0%, mass ratio), MP0.5 (0.5%), MP1 (1%), MP2 (2%), MP4 (4%), and MP8 (8%). The experiment aimed to examine the effects of MPs on soil nitrogen content, physicochemical properties, nitrogen cycling-related genes, microorganisms, and gross nitrogen transformation rates. The results revealed no significant changes in soil total nitrogen and dissolved total nitrogen. However, dissolved organic nitrogen significantly decreased by 16.00-54.60% following MP addition, while ammonium (NH4+-N, 45.71-271.43%) and nitrate (NO3--N, 43.15-209.54%) nitrogen and microbial biomass nitrogen (46.02-123.70%) significantly increased. Soil pH, bulk density, and soil porosity decreased after MP addition, while soil carbon contents, water-stable macroaggregates, and redox potential increased. The soil microbial community structure changed significantly, and microbial diversity increased under MP treatment. MP addition significantly altered the abundance of soil nitrogen cycling functional genes. The relative abundance of nitrogen fixation and denitrification genes decreased with increasing MP addition rates, while organic degradation and synthesis genes increased. The soil nitrogen cycling functional microbial composition shifted dramatically with increased MP addition. Networks with high addition rates (MP2 +MP4 +MP8) exhibited more total nodes, total links, negative links, node degrees, and modules but shorter average path distances and lower modularity than those with low addition rates (CK +MP0.5 +MP1), reflecting increased network complexity induced by MPs. The gross ammonification rate, NH4+-N consumption and immobilization rates, and NO3--N immobilization rate increased, while the gross nitrification rate and net nitrification rate exhibited an initial increase followed by a decrease with increasing MP addition rates, peaking at MP2. Furthermore, redundancy analysis and structural equation modeling demonstrated that soil physicochemical properties significantly affected soil nitrogen cycling genes and microorganisms, ultimately altering nitrogen content. In conclusion, polyethylene MPs promoted soil nitrogen mineralization and transformation and changed the related functional microorganism community structure, exhibiting a noticeable dose-effect relationship. This study provides deeper insight into the effects of MPs on soil nitrogen cycling.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,his work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20210167).,Journal of Hazardous Materials,,,,2023-06-14,2023,2023-06-14,2023-09,458,,131857,Closed,Article,"Zhou, Zhidong; Hua, Jianfeng; Xue, Jianhui","Zhou, Zhidong (Jiangsu Key Laboratory for the Research and Utilization of Plant Resources, Institute of Botany, Jiangsu Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210014, China; Nanjing Botanical Garden Mem.

Understanding the magnitudes of rhizosphere effects (RE, difference in bio-physicochemical properties between rhizosphere and bulk soils) on soil microbial communities and their moderators is important for studying on below-ground carbon (C) cycling. A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the REs on soil microbial biomass, community structure, respiration, and C-degrading enzymes. We found that REs on soil C and nutrients, total microbial biomass, the abundance of specific microbial groups, fungi to bacteria ratio, respiration, and C-degrading enzymes were positive, but the magnitudes were varied with biomes, plant functional types, and mycorrhizal types. REs on microbial biomass, respiration, and C-degrading enzymes increased with the increase of mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation, but decreased with the increase of soil clay, C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) contents. The REs on microbial biomass and respiration also increased as the REs on soil C:N:P increased. Compared with bulk soil, per unit rhizosphere soil C supported more microbial biomass, per unit of which respired more C, leading to faster C decomposition in rhizosphere. Our findings indicate that the increase in microbial biomass, co-metabolism induced by labile and energy-rich organic C of root exudates, and overflow respiration induced by stoichiometric imbalance together contribute to the enhanced C decomposition in rhizosphere. The global pattern of REs on soil microbial communities is critical to revealing the plant-microbe-soil interactions in terrestrial ecosystems.","We thank all the researchers whose data were used in this global synthesis.

The recent changes to the environmental, social and governance (ESG) obligations of mining companies should help to ensure that water and land resources as well as post-mining employment opportunities are considered as a part of mine closure. Integrating microalgae production into mine closure plans is a potential opportunity for mining companies to improve many ESG outcomes. Mine sites with sufficient suitable land and water resources in high solar radiation geographies may be able to economically grow microalgae to capture atmospheric CO2, re-purpose saline mine waters, treat acidic and near-neutral pH metalliferous waters as well as produce soil ameliorants (biofertiliser, biostimulants and/or biochar) to improve mine rehabilitation outcomes. Microalgae production facilities may also provide an alternative industry and employment opportunities to help transition regional mining towns that have become reliant on mining activities.

This may have alleviated N limitation and thus stimulated productivity and carbon (C) sequestration in aboveground woody biomass (AGWB), a stable C pool with long turnover times. This 'carbon bonus' of human N use partly offsets the climate impact of human-induced N2 O emissions, but its magnitude and spatial variation are uncertain. Here we used a meta-regression approach to identify sources of heterogeneity in tree biomass C-N response (additional C stored per unit of N) based on data from fertilization experiments in global forests. We identified important drivers of spatial variation in forest biomass C-N response related to climate (potential evapotranspiration), soil fertility (N content) and tree characteristics (stand age), and used these relationships to quantify global spatial variation in N-induced forest biomass C sequestration. Results show that N deposition enhances biomass C sequestration in only one-third of global forests, mainly in the boreal region, while N reduces C sequestration in 5% of forests, mainly in the tropics. In the remaining 59% of global forests, N addition has no impact on biomass C sequestration. Average C-N responses were 11 (4-21) kg C per kg N for boreal forests, 4 (0-8) kg C per kg N for temperate forests and 0 (-4 to 5) kg C per kg N for tropical forests. Our global estimate of the N-induced forest biomass C sink of 41 (-53 to 159) Tg C yr-1 is substantially lower than previous estimates, mainly due to the absence of any response in most tropical forests (accounting for 58% of the global forest area). Overall, the N-induced C sink in AGWB only offsets ~5% of the climate impact of N2 O emissions (in terms of 100-year global warming potential), and contributes ~1% to the gross forest C sink.","We thank Lex Bouwman, Michael Gundale and two anonymous reviewers for valuable suggestions on improving the manuscript.

However, estimates of carbon-offset potential are currently based on data from natural mangrove forests, potentially leading to overestimating the carbon-offset potential from restored mangroves. Here, in the first study of its kind, we utilise 210Pb sediment age-dating techniques and greenhouse gas flux measures to estimate blue carbon additionality in restored mangrove forests, ranging from 13 to 35 years old. As expected, mangrove age had a significant effect on carbon additionality and carbon accretion rate, with the older mangrove stands (17 and 35 years old) holding double the total carbon stocks (aboveground + soil stocks; ∼115 tonnes C ha-1) and double the soil sequestration rates (∼3 tonnes C ha-1 yr-1) than the youngest mangrove stand (13 years old). Although soil carbon stocks increased with mangrove age, the aboveground plant stocks were highest in the 17-year-old stand. Mangrove age also had a significant effect on soil carbon fluxes, with the older mangroves (≥17 years) releasing one-fourth of the CH4 emissions, but double the CO2 flux compared to young stands. Our study suggests that the carbon sink capacity of restored mangrove forests increases with age, but stabilises once they mature (e.g., >17 years). This means that by using carbon sequestration and emissions from natural forests, mangrove restoration projects may be overestimating their carbon sequestration potential.","We are grateful to the effort and enthusiasm of the 60 citizen scientists that joined the #BlueCarbonArmy and supported the data collection activities at Stony Creek Backwash, Melbourne.

However, its emissions to the atmosphere have gone largely unchecked because the microbial and environmental controls governing N2 O emissions have proven difficult to manage. The microbial process N2 O consumption is the only know biotic pathway to remove N2 O from soil pores and therefore reduce N2 O emissions. Consequently, manipulating soils to increase N2 O consumption by organic carbon (OC) additions has steadily gained interest. However, the response of N2 O emissions to different OC additions are inconsistent, and it is unclear if lower N2 O emissions are due to increased consumption, decreased production, or both. Simplified and systematic studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of different OC additions on N2 O consumption. We aimed to manipulate N2 O consumption by amending soils with OC compounds (succinate, acetate, propionate) more directly available to denitrifiers. We hypothesized that N2 O consumption is OC-limited and predicted these denitrifier-targeted additions would lead to enhanced N2 O consumption and increased nosZ gene abundance. We incubated diverse soils in the laboratory and performed a 15 N2 O isotope pool dilution assay to disentangle microbial N2 O emissions from consumption using laser-based spectroscopy. We found that amending soils with OC increased gross N2 O consumption in six of eight soils tested. Furthermore, three of eight soils showed Increased N2 O Consumption and Decreased N2 O Emissions (ICDE), a phenomenon we introduce in this study as an N2 O management ideal. All three ICDE soils had low soil OC content, suggesting ICDE is a response to relaxed C-limitation wherein C additions promote soil anoxia, consequently stimulating the reduction of N2 O via denitrification. We suggest, generally, OC additions to low OC soils will reduce N2 O emissions via ICDE. Future studies should prioritize methodical assessment of different, specific, OC-additions to determine which additions show ICDE in different soils.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank Torrey Stephenson for his tremendous assistance during field and lab work—you went above and beyond.

Whether the impacts of different grazing intensities on carbon sequestration vary with precipitation over a broad geographic scales across China's grasslands remains unclear. In the context of striving for carbon neutrality, we carried out a meta-analysis based on 156 peer-reviewed journal articles to synthesize the general impacts of different grazing intensities on carbon sequestration with different precipitations. Our results showed that light, moderate, and heavy grazing dramatically reduced the soil organic carbon stocks by 3.43 %, 13.68 %, and 16.77 % in arid grasslands, respectively (P < 0.05), while light and moderate grazing did not alter soil organic carbon stocks in humid grasslands (P > 0.05). Moreover, the change rates of soil organic carbon stocks were all tightly positively associated with those of soil water content under different grazing intensities (P < 0.05). Further analysis revealed strong positive relationships between mean annual precipitation with the change rates of above- and belowground biomasses, soil microbial biomass carbon, and soil organic carbon stocks under moderate grazing intensity (P < 0.05). These findings imply that carbon sequestration is relatively less tolerant to grazing disturbance in arid grasslands than humid grasslands, which may be primary due to the grazing-intensified water limitation for plant growth and soil microbial activities under low precipitation. Our study is of implication to predict carbon budget of China's grasslands and help adopt sustainable management to strive for carbon neutrality.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Microorganisms are an essential component in biocrusts. They add and accelerate critical biochemical processes. However, little is known about the functional genes and metabolic processes of microbiomes in lichen and moss biocrust. This study used shotgun metagenomic sequencing to compare the microbiomes of lichen-dominated and moss-dominated biocrust and reveal the microbial genes and metabolic pathways involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling. The results showed that Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria were more abundant in moss biocrust than lichen biocrust, while Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria were more abundant in lichen biocrust than moss biocrust. The relative abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes and enzymes associated with carbon and nitrogen metabolism differed significantly between microbiomes of the two biocrust types. However, in the microbial communities of both biocrust types, respiration pathways dominated over carbon fixation pathways. The genes encoding carbon monoxide dehydrogenase were more abundant than those encoding ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo) involved in carbon fixation. Similarly, metabolic N-pathway diversity was dominated by nitrogen reduction, followed by denitrification, with nitrogen fixation the lowest proportion. Gene diversity involved in N cycling differed between the microbiomes of the two biocrust types. Assimilatory nitrate reduction genes had higher relative abundance in lichen biocrust, whereas dissimilatory nitrate reduction genes had higher relative abundance in moss biocrust. As dissolved organic carbon and soil organic carbon are considered the main drivers of the community structure in the microbiome of biocrust, these results indicate that biocrust type has a pivotal role in microbial diversity and related biogeochemical cycling.","We thank all people involved in the maintenance of the experiment.

Previous studies have reported the effect of sowing rate on oat yield; however, the results from such studies are inconsistent. Thus, based on 43 studies across eight countries, this study aimed to assess changes in hay and grain yields in response to sowing rate and, in combination with a boosted regression tree, to evaluate and rank the dominant factors (e.g. climate conditions, soil conditions, and sowing rate) affecting changes in hay and grain yields of oat.
RESULTS: The results revealed that increasing the sowing rate significantly increased the response ratio of grain yields and hay yields by averages of 7.3% and 7.9% respectively. However, the response ratios of grain yields and hay yields in response to changes in sowing rate were affected by different factors. Climate condition and mean annual precipitation primarily affected the response ratios of hay yields, whereas the sowing rate dominated changes in the response ratios of grain yields, with the response ratios of grain yields peaking at a sowing rate of 85 kg ha-1 .
CONCLUSION: Optimizing the sowing rate with site-specific environmental conditions could be a potential strategy for profitable oat production, given that oat can be produced under marginal environments (e.g. cool-wet climates and soil with low fertility). © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.","We thank all the researchers whose data were used in this meta‐analysis.

To analyze the evolution of the concentration and prevalence of POPs such as α-HCH, β-HCH, γ-HCH, ∑-HCH, Heptachlor, Aldrin, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, ∑-DDT, and ∑-OCP in water resources, a search between January 01, 1970, to February 10, 2020, was followed using a systematic review and meta-analysis prevalence. Among the 2306 explored articles in the reconnaissance step, 311 articles with 5315 exemplars, 56 countries, and 4 types of water were included in the meta-analysis study. Among all studied POPs, the concentration of p,p'-DDT in water resources was the highest, especially in drinking water resources. The overall rank order based on the concentration and prevalence of POPs were surface water > drinking water > seawater > groundwater. To identify POPs-contaminated areas, the distance from the mean relative to their distribution was considered. The most to the least polluted areas included: South Africa, India, Turkey, Pakistan, Canada, Hong Kong, and China. The highest carcinogenic risk was observed for β-HCH (Turkey and China), followed by α-HCH (Mexico). The highest non-carcinogenic risk was identified for Aldrin (all analyzed countries), followed by Dieldrin (Turkey) and γ-HCH (Mexico). The Monte Carlo analysis (under the assumption that γ-HCH has a normal distribution), the mean obtained was 8.22E-07 for children and 3.83E-07 for adults. This is in accordance with the standard risk assessment approach. In terms of percentiles, the Monte-Carlo approach indicates that 75% of child population is under the 1.07E-06 risk and 95% of adults under 7.35E-06.",This paper has been supported by the RUDN University Strategic Academic Leadership Program (Alireza Khataee).,,The Science of The Total Environment,,,"Adult; Child; DDT; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Persistent Organic Pollutants; Risk Assessment; Water",2021-07-10,2021,2021-07-10,2021-11,796,,149000,Closed,Article,"Vasseghian, Yasser; Hosseinzadeh, Sevda; Khataee, Alireza; Dragoi, Elena-Niculina","Vasseghian, Yasser (Department of Chemical Engineering, Quchan University of Technology, Quchan, Iran.); Hosseinzadeh, Sevda (Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Tabriz, 51666-16471 Tabriz, Iran.); Khataee, Alireza (Research Laboratory of Advanced Water and Wastewater Treatment Processes, Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Tabriz, 51666-16471 Tabriz, Iran; Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University), 6 Miklukho-Maklaya Street, Moscow 117198, Russia.

While this has resulted in large ecological changes aboveground such as altered tree species composition and increased forest density, little is known about the long-term, belowground implications of altered, ecologically novel, fire regimes, especially on soil biological processes. To better understand the long-term implications of ecologically novel, high-severity fire, we used a 44-yr high-severity fire chronosequence in the Sierra Nevada where forests were historically adapted to frequent, low-severity fire, but were fire suppressed for at least 70 yr. High-severity fire in the Sierra Nevada resulted in a long-term (44 +yr) decrease (>50%, P < 0.05) in soil extracellular enzyme activities, basal microbial respiration (56-72%, P < 0.05), and organic carbon (>50%, P < 0.05) in the upper 5 cm compared to sites that had not been burned for at least 115 yr. However, nitrogen (N) processes were only affected in the most recent fire site (4 yr post-fire). Net nitrification increased by over 600% in the most recent fire site (P < 0.001), but returned to similar levels as the unburned control in the 13-yr site. Contrary to previous studies, we did not find a consistent effect of plant cover type on soil biogeochemical processes in mid-successional (10-50 yr) forest soils. Rather, the 44-yr reduction in soil organic carbon (C) quantity correlated positively with dampened C cycling processes. Our results show the drastic and long-term implication of ecologically novel, high-severity fire on soil biogeochemistry and underscore the need for long-term fire ecological experiments.","We thank Susan Glaser for her extensive laboratory and field support and Asmeret Asefaw Berhe, J.

It is widely known that climate change and soil water content (SWC) could influence the SOC dynamics; however, there are still debates about how climate change, especially climate warming, and SWC impact SOC. We investigated the spatiotemporal changes in SOC and its responses to climate warming and root-zone SWC change using the coupled hydro-biogeochemical model (SWAT-DayCent) and climate scenarios data derived under the three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) from five downscaled Global Climate Models (GCMs) in a typical loess watershed––the Jinghe River Basin (JRB) on the Chinese Loess Plateau.ResultsThe air temperature would increase significantly during the future period (2017–2099), while the annual precipitation would increase by 2.0–13.1% relative to the baseline period (1976–2016), indicating a warmer and wetter future in the JRB. Driven by the precipitation variation, the root-zone SWC would also increase (by up to 27.9% relative to the baseline under RCP4.5); however, the SOC was projected to decrease significantly under the future warming climate. The combined effects of climate warming and SWC change could more reasonably explain the SOC loss, and this formed hump-shaped response surfaces between SOC loss and warming-SWC interactions under both RCP2.6 and 8.5, which can help explain diverse warming effects on SOC with changing SWC.ConclusionsThe study showed a significant potential carbon source under the future warmer and wetter climate in the JRB, and the SOC loss was largely controlled by future climate warming and the root-zone SWC as well. The hump-shaped responses of the SOC loss to climate warming and SWC change demonstrated that the SWC could mediate the warming effects on SOC loss, but this mediation largely depended on the SWC changing magnitude (drier or wetter soil conditions). This mediation mechanism about the effect of SWC on SOC would be valuable for enhancing soil carbon sequestration in a warming climate on the Loess Plateau.",We thank the HPCC Platform in Xi’an Jiaotong University for computing equipment and computer maintenance.

However, the dynamics underlying soil aggregate distribution and aggregate-associated SOC concentration after such conversion remain inadequately understood, especially in the red slate soil region of subtropical China, where the stability of soil aggregates is the primary deterrent to soil erosion. This study investigated the effects of land use changes on soil aggregates and aggregate-associated organic carbon content in diverse soil layers in the aforementioned region. Soil samples were collected from seven typical land use types (natural forest, artificial forest, terraced citrus orchard, downhill citrus orchard, kiwifruit orchard, cornfield, and paddy field). Sampling was conducted at a depth of 0 to 100 cm and at 20 cm increments to determine aggregate distribution and aggregate-associated SOC content. Results showed that land use change and soil depth significantly affected aggregate stability and associated SOC concentration. Upon the conversion of natural forests to orchards and croplands, both macroaggregate (>0.25 mm) and SOC concentrations decreased, thereby weakening soil resistance to erosion caused by flowing water. However, the conversion of natural forests to artificial forests did not decrease aggregate stability or aggregate-associated SOC concentration, suggesting that artificial forests are alternative tree species for soil erosion control, aggregate stability enhancement, and SOC fixation. A general linear model indicated that land use changes accounted for 55 % and 56 % of the total variations in SOC concentration in >5 mm and 2.5 mm aggregates, respectively, implying that such changes more significantly affected large-grain aggregates. This study deepens the understanding of SOC accumulation mechanisms and provides valuable information on improving soil quality and physical structure in the red slate soil region of subtropical China.","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42177322, 42007021); the Open Project Fund of Karst Dynamics Laboratory, MNR, and GZAR (KDLGuangxi 202010); General Program of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2020M672498); the Double First-Class Disciplines Outstanding Youth Foundation of the Department of Education of Hunan Province (19B282); the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS (2020359); and the Science and Technology Innovation Program of Hunan Province (2021RC3115).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Soil; Carbon; Forests; China,2022-10-01,2022,2022-10-01,2023-01,856,Pt 2,159194,Closed,Article,"Jiang, Wansong; Li, Zhenwei; Xie, Hongxia; Ouyang, Kai; Yuan, Hong; Duan, Liangxia","Jiang, Wansong (College of Resources & Environment, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China.); Li, Zhenwei (Huanjiang Observation and Research Station for Karst Ecosystem, Key Laboratory for Agro-Ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha 410125, China.
