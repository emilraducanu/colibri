        "Title": "How does soil water status influence the fate of soil organic matter? A review of processes across scales",
        "Abstract": "Due to its influence on multiple soil processes, water intervenes in biogeochemical cycles at multiple spatial scales with contrasting effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. On all scales, water availability influences biological processes, such as plant growth and (micro-)biological activity, leading to organic matter input, its decomposition and stabilisation. On the other hand, SOC influences soil hydrology via its impact on soil wettability and its structural organisation. Our objectives were to review the mechanisms involved in the complex relationship between water and SOC at different scales and to discuss levers of action to improve its modelling and management. We carried out a systematic review and synthesised the information of 987 articles dealing with SOC sequestration and soil water.At the landscape scale, precipitation levels influence vegetation type and biomass production as well as horizontal and vertical transport, determining SOC stocks and their spatial distribution. At the profile scale, SOC and water both control biological processes including those involved in soil aggregate formation, and organi-sation of soil porosity. Soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and stabilisation processes occur at the microscale, where water movement facilitates the co-occurrence of SOM and microorganisms.All these multiscale processes may change the nature and distribution of SOM, leading to promotion or in-hibition not only of biogeochemical cycling but also of the water cycle. Taking into account these mutual feedback mechanisms in mechanistic models requires their representation at multiple scales through developing modelling parameters in particular for microbial processes occurring in the pore space. This could greatly reduce modelling uncertainty and improve our understanding of global carbon cycling.Levers of action to improve soil water status and consequently SOC accrual include irrigation, and use of organic amendments. Sustainable agricultural practices should focus on (1) optimising the management of water resources and (2) choosing crop species adapted to various water levels to maintain and foster SOC sequestration, to adapt to climate change and in particular extreme events, such as drought and flooding.",

        "Title": "Substrate identity and amount overwhelm temperature effects on soil carbon formation",
        "Abstract": "The size of the soil carbon sink depends on the balance between soil organic matter (SOM) formation and decomposition. Our understanding of how SOM forms and is stabilized, however, is shifting. Traditional theory maintains the formation of SOM is due to chemical complexity: difficult to decompose plant inputs persist in the soil while easily decomposable inputs are respired as CO2. However, consensus is now building around an alternative thesis, hypothesizing that the plant inputs most easily assimilated by soil decomposers are the ones stabilized as SOM because dead microbial biomass is now considered one of the primary components of stable SOM. As such, the efficiency with which the microbial community uses these plant inputs has direct implications for the amount and rate of SOM formation under both a constant and changing climate. Our study empirically tests and measures the effects of substrate quality, quantity, and temperature on SOM formation rates a process that may have profound impact on carbon stocks. We used C-13-labeled substrates representative of plant root exudates (simple sugars, amino acids, and organic acids) to determine the proportion of substrate retained within SOM, microbial biomass, dissolved organic carbon, or evolved as (CO2)-C-13. We found that glucose, the substrate most efficiently assimilated by the microbial biomass, leads to the greatest amount of SOM formation compared to glycine and oxalic acid. In contrast to expectations, higher concentrations of substrate addition lead to proportionally less C-13 label retention than lower concentrations. Temperature had a negligible impact on SOM formation, with higher temperatures actually leading to slight increases in SOM formation. While substrate quality and quantity drove the largest differences in SOM formation rates, once metabolized by the microbial biomass, eventual incorporation of carbon into the mineral associated SOM pool (thought to be the most stable of the soil C pools), was effectively equivalent across treatments. Our data suggest that changing composition and amount of labile carbon substrates supplied to soils will likely be key determinants of SOM formation rates and, hence, potentially soil carbon stock sizes.",

        "Title": "What is the impact of human wastewater biosolids (sewage sludge) application on long-term soil carbon sequestration rates? A systematic review protocol",
        "Abstract": "Background: Human wastewater biosolids, hereafter referred to as biosolids, are produced in significant quantities around the world and often applied to an extensive land mass including agricultural fields, forests, mine lands, and urban areas. Land-application of biosolids has been reported in peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed work to change soil organic carbon stocks in varying amounts. Determining the potential of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock change and sequestration from biosolids land application is critical for biosolids producers and users to gain access to carbon credit markets. Our review question is, what is the impact of biosolids application on long-term soil carbon sequestration rates?We look to explore this main question with the follow-up, does biosolids processing methods and characteristics, application method, soil properties, land management and other modifiers affect rates of carbon accumulation from land-applied biosolids? Methods: Searches will be conducted using online databases (i.e., Web of Science Core Collection, CAB Abstracts, Scopus, Pro Quest Dissertations &Theses Global), search engines (Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic), and specialist websites to find primary field studies and grey literature of biosolids land-application effects on soil organic carbon stocks. We will use English search terms and predefined inclusion criteria of: (1) a field study of at least 24 months that reports soil organic carbon/matter (SOC/SOM) concentrations/stocks; (2) has two types of treatments: (i) a control (non-intervention AND/OR synthetic fertilizer) AND (ii) a biosolids-based amendment; and (3) information of amendment properties and application dates and rates to estimate the relative contribution of the applied materials to SOC changes. We will screen results in two stages: (1) title and abstract and (2) full text. A 10% subset will be screened by two reviewers for inclusion at the title and abstract level and use a kappa analysis to ensure agreement of at least 0.61. All results in the full text stage will be dual screened. Data will be extracted by one person and reviewed by a second person. Critical appraisal will be used to assess studies' potential bias and done by two reviewers. A meta-analysis using random effects models will be conducted if sufficient data of high enough quality are extracted.",
