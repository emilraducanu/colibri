**colibri** is a Python package aimed to synthesise scientific literature. Specify the topic you want to study and **colibri** will select publications from various sources, analyse, extract and compile relevant data from them.

This project was developed as part of the [Operationalising International Reseach Cooperation on Soil carbon (ORCaSa)](https://irc-orcasa.eu/), an initiative that aims to bring together international stakeholders working on techniques for capturing and storing carbon in the soil.

:warning: *Disclaimer* <br/>
*This package is developed in the spirit of synthesising all kind of literature focusing on any topics. For the moment, only the compilation of meta-analyses dealing with the impact of human practices on soil organic carbon is currently implemented.*
